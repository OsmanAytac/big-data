 good location excellent staff good fascilities my children love the place,1
 place is really old cramped and dirty even dirtier than london in general there was a smell in the room i was initially put into and another smell in another room i asked for ,0
 staffs attitude tv not working air con in room not working run down hotel needs updating ,0
 very limited room facilities very old furniture very slow wifi very narrow lift very narrow room ,0
 the charging mechanism they added 50 to room rate for any extras i y have used i didn t use any but they still charged my bank account the additional 50 they do not attempt to resolve the overcharging they hang up the phone and do not respond to emails the issue is still outstanding ,0
 management extremely terrible i had a flight which is late so the receptionist ask us to leave the baggage they will take it from the room and keep it in the storage room when we can we realized that our bags still in the room nobody picked it up and they charged us extra night despite its there mistake the manager was rude very un professional he s the insisted to charge us extra night ,0
 nothing like pictures got given a tiny room view wasn t anything special got charged incorrectly shuttle service to clapham finishes at 10 so the walk isn t plesant use money else where i wouldn t stay there again,0
 room upgrade was great and hotel was very clean and modern,1
 if you want to feel how it was to be a custumer in the soviet union be a guest at this hotel with its ex soviet staff no customer service there specially the male staff so rude all but one nice girl that really tried indre ,0
 they were more than accommodating with allowing early check in and complementary late check out would really recommend the apex group of hotels for your business or leisure travels ,1
 poor service ignorant front desk lack of info during terror attacks no sauvignon blanc no bath despite upgrade very small room despite upgrade no recognition of being regular return guest,0
 we didn t appreciate paper cups for tea and coffee and disposable glasses no facewashers were supplied and towels were very thin and worn ,0
 rooms very small for what you pay window doesn t open just 5 cm no air into the room at all my worst room ever pictures in the booking com are showing big rooms no way near the truth i booked a deluxe double room and didnt have even a chair to sit on although in the picture it shows one a real cheat would not recommend this hotel to anyone in fact i will start making negative advertising ,0
 the staff were very unhelpful room was too warm and the hotel extremely loud with people shouting at all hours of the morning ,0
 we were therefor an anniversary and the staff couldn t do more to make our stay a lovely one we even got a room upgrade thank you ,1
 services clean hospitality location,1
 the booking was done for deluxe double room and from 23rd i called them ahead to tell them i will be checking only on 24th morning i land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself once it got unblocked they provided me a compact room where if you walk you will hit a wall when i enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors when i was not buying the story they provided me the actual deluxe double room that is more comfy the staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at during all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his palace ,0
 tiny rooms with paper thin walls meaning you can hear everything going on in neighbouring rooms beds and pillows very uncomfortable ,0
 the property is badly run down and needing attention badly marked walls and doors dirty appliances and i wouldn t take my socks off on that carpet the lifts stopped working the hot water was unreliable on the first night very surprised at the state of the hotel given the price ,0
 small clean hotel great location very convenient staff friendly and helpful ,1
 bed too short tiny room tiny closet tiny bathroom etc stars given in booking com are absolutely wrong i would not give more than 2 stars for what you get there the price is impertinent ,0
 very luxury,1
 the breakfast was super delicious the layout of the room was spot on ,1
 the location the friendly staff in all departments made us feel at home as soon as we arrived multi national staff great team especially the irishman called bernad ,1
 phone call several hours before while we were still in france saying they would like to change our room to another place on the other side of london we said this was not possible a different room was found for us reputedly better but surely the original room couldn t have been smaller consistent refusal to find storage space for bikes in spite of requesting this on the booking com form eventually after much debate space was found in the luggage room too expensive for what was offered ,0
 the position of the hotel is excellent both for walkers and for the use of public transport staff are friendly and very helpful and the rooms are very clean and comfortable ,1
 bar area and staff are good the hotel needs a proper restaurant ,1
 staff very rude the smallest room i have ever stay i my life ,0
 brilliant location for palais de luxembourg sorbonne etc friendly and helpful new bathroom facilities and bed great ,1
 condition of room never should have let it out as the carpet was saturated with old water and the noise level was terrible,0

 super spot goinf back in april with the familt,1
 comfortable bed and room spotless nice to have complimentary biscuits ,1
 pretty lobby lounge area kettle with tea coffee and hot chocolate clean bathroom ,1
 pefect location,1
 the hotel service was great they are very helpful they had some maintaining problems when we arrived but a replacement and complements were very properly provided and we were pleased for the extra service during the our staying the room was however unexpectedly small but the good service quality may fulfil for any inconvenience ,1
 very clean and tidy,1
 location staff and room was good sized,1
 i cannot fault anything we thoroughly enjoyed our stay right from being greeted at the door to checking out nothing was too much trouble for the staff and what a fantastic location the hotel is in everyone should treat themselves to a little luxury and stay at this hotel,1
 big rooms nice location ,1
 bad room very old furniture,0
 the hotel was beautiful exactly like the pictures excellent staff and fast private cab pick up would recommend,1
 have booked the hotel for 3 pax a few months before checking in and put in a request for air conditioning summer and ground floor room else need an elevetor we had 6 luggages instead we were given a room in basement two with 2 miserable fans because we were late in our check in not acceptable as the booking was made much earlier and request was also put in then the room should have been reserved if not ground floor maybe in basement one the staff should have tried to accommodate our request and not give the reason as the hotel was full and we were late in checking in worse still we stayed here for 2 nights and on the second night they removed a fan from our room we insisted that they replaced the missing fan as the room was very stuffy with no windows overall stay was not good ,0
 bed was good but pillow could be better ,1
 nice location to kings cross station and clean room ,1
 great service from the moment we arrived we upgraded to a junior suite well worth the little extra for a great room very clean and well appointed excellent staff from the house keeping reception bar porters and concierge we could not fault them and will defiantly return,1
 amazing staff made our stay great for our anniversary,1
 great hotel staff and location ,1
 the room was way too small no elevator no wardrobe and last day the room hasn t been cleaned at all definetly not worth the money ,0
 when we arrived they had given our room to someone else they said they had informed booking com to tell us but we never received this info ,0
 we ordered a queen room it was tiny and the bed was so small and up against a wall so i had to climb over my partner to get into bed ,0
 breakfast was great good location and friendly staff ,1
 the staff where amazing,1
 we were upgraded to a very nice suite the concierge was very helpful ,1
 hotel was falling apart furniture broken cupboard coming off in your hands lobby furniture was broken and had holes in the sofa a nightmare and most certainly not 4 stars ,0
 great location great staff we had a wonderful stay and will definitely return in the future ,1
 the rooms are very small the hotel bar shuts at 11 30 so if your planning a nightcap drink forget it ,0
 horrible hotel hotel was so dirty the wall was stained with anything you can imagine and the cleaning service was horrible they dont really clean up the room just leave more towels there s no airconditioning the hall way was more cooler than the room we had to leave the door opened and what ever concierge says about condition of tourist spot was not true do not stay here ,0
 staff very rude rooms very dated and old room temperature far too hot not able to switch on the air bathrooms very dated and not very clean was locked during 30 minutes in the room as the door handle broke will not return to this hotel,0
 bedroom was like a walk in wardrobe staff had very limited english wasn t asked if i slept well on either nights room had a loud running water noise all night premier inn hotels are x20s better,0
 it is really a five star hotel rooms are small there is no tv i stayed in executive room which comes along with a executive lounge the smallest lounge i have seen in my life cramped with people and there was no room to sit went three times there and finally gave up horrible food no parking space staff was rude to assist simply told find a space somewhere putside the hotel on a street the so called queen size bed is smallest i have seen in a 5 star hotel very basic facilities room looked like a hostel room breakfast was served in a way that it gave me a feeling that i was being served in a flight smallest glasses and plates possible avoid this hotel at all cost only word staff knew was what please or excuse me were not in their dictionary ,0
 mosquito inside the shower gel unoppened bottle breakfast of poor quality there are much better options to eat around the area,0
 the lack of wifi in our room also please be aware your bathroom floors are very slippery with socks on ,0
 great location the rooms and bathrooms are very well laid out with plenty of storage elemis products shampoo conditioner bath gel and lotion lovely coffee and tea service includes milk chocolate and different types of sugar plenty of outlets clever desk vanity set up is a perfect area to dry hair makeup the bench at the end of the bed is also very handy ,1
 great nearby restaurants very popular so make sure to book at least fri sat super cosy area ,1
 agtha in the breakfast room was extremely nice friendly always had a smile on her face so helpful she impressed us the most ,1
 the staff was so helpful and they allowed us to early check in ,1
 booked a twin room was told there was none available i would not except a double so eventually they found me a twin stained sheets on one bed water in shower not very hot tv did not work room unbearably hot had to wait approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour for my breakfast order key to room did not work on the second day used tea and coffee cups left in room and were not replaced ,0
 great location to eventim apollo easy check in and out clean and comfortable room and a fabulous breakfast in the morning couldn t ask for more ,1
 historic style of the hotel proximity to important sights,1
 staff were delightful the ability to alter the temperature of the room with ease was great and the rooms were comfortable the room was clean the shower worked well and was easy to use great location and great value for money amazing price ,1
 on arrival we were able to leave our bag and told our room would be available from 2pm great we thought that all fits with our plans however this relaxed feeling was short lived when we returned to check in later that day we were met with a long queue that took 40 minutes to process before we made it to the front only to be told the hotel was fully booked how we wondered could this be we d booked 2 3 months prior to our check in date and received confirmation our reservation had been confirmed we were informed that our booking would be honoured at a neighbouring hotel and a free taxi transfer would be arranged for us within 5 minutes 30 minutes later our taxi had not arrived and we noticed ours wasn t the only one that hadn t turned up so far we had been well over an hour a further 20 minutes later a taxi finally arrived and we were taken to a hotel only a few minutes away needless to say the other hotel dealt with us promptly on arrival but all the drama at check could if been avoided if only we had been told upfront ,0
 the staff was unfriendly my room was dusty the hotel seems run down and the room service selection was terrible at night there is not even any food available never returning to this hotel ,0
 we had a great studio which worked well with the kids sleeping on a king size sofa bed,1
 the room had great views and the staff were very friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them great location right next to the o2 arena and walking distance from the tube station the spa area and gym are really well equipped and very clean probably one of the best we have used anywhere ,1
 beautiful room excellent location hotel manager james was brilliant sorting out an issue ,1
 beautiful room everything was really clean and impeccably presentes loved it ,1
 great location very friendly staff ,1
 perfect location for the eventim appollo lyric theatre also hammersmith tube bus station the buffet breakfast was fabulous ,1
 security and managment staff,0
 prior to arriving i emailed the hotel twice to confirm that i had booked a twin room which they replied yes however after checking into the place we found that this was not the case and the room was so small you could not actually move the beds apart or walk around the room the staff subsequently could not relocate my friend and i to another room due to the hotel being full the shower was dimly lit and with close inspection you could see mold that could easily be removed if cleaned properly under the bed looked as if it had not been cleared for the past 5 years they could also do with spending of money on new pillows thought the copies and money notes glued to the ceiling was really tacky along with the red light in shower my colleague commented that it looked more like a room you d book by the hour than the night we both felt completely flogged off and would have changed hotels if i could have found another local hotel with a vacant room have no idea how this place got its 4 stars ,0
 the location cannot be beat and the staff was superb they were all very knowledgeable and accommodating and spoke very good english ,1
 rooms were tiny but very nice lovely staff,1
 i work for a 5 star hotel in nyc the staff went above and beyond the front desk staff and bell men are amazing i really felt like i was at home very safe you all gave me 5 star service you are the best ,1
 main entrance was closed waited 30 mins check in hotel run down decor very poor paint peeling off rust on ice machines limescale on taps plug broken the list goes on,0
 facilities where good and excellent staff and food,1
 i booked the hotel as a double room for my partner and i on what was supposed to be our engagement weekend when we arrived we were put in a twin room with two small single beds pushed together there was no attempt to tell us that we weren t in a double room when i went to the reception to inform them that we had been put in a twin room by mistake i was told by the lady at reception that they did not have any double rooms as apparently the toilet was broken in the double room which i was sceptical about when i asked politely if there was anything that could be done she rudely replied that s not my problem and then turned away from me i couldn t believe how rude she was i was stunned another couple overheard as they went past and told me that they had the exact same experience my suspicions that the hotel lied about the broken toilet were confirmed when i e mailed them and they replied with a different excuse that they had overbooked they added that they would compensate me with a free breakfast this is basically a scam where a hotel makes you pay for a double room knowing that they do not have one they have squeezed two uncomfortable single beds together in the hope that they will get away with it they do not care remotely about your comfort so please do not anticipate that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable i honestly am not a demanding customer in most cicumstances and rarely make any form of complaint but feel it necessary to warn people that even though i can accept that this hotel s rooms are small not well ventilated and a little uncomfortable but they do not provide rooms to the specificity they claim and are incredibly rude with little to no customer service there are vastly better options all around paris do not trust this hotel as more reviews become available at this relatively new hotel you will discover that this is far from a legitimate and respectable four star hotel ,0
 i didn t like that neither booking nor the hotel let me know in advence that the air conditioning of the whole building wasn t working so when i got there with 33 degrees i found out in my room that there was a portable fan opening the window was out of the question as all the kitchen and smoking smells from below would get in the room i didn t sleep well not even one of the three nights i was there it wasn t possible to ask for a refund and move to a different hotel the spa does didn t have a good service and the receptionist was totally unkind ,0
 the reception staff noticed it was my birthday and when i arrived back in my room there was a piece of cake with happy birthday written on the plate i thought that was fantastic ,1
 i would rate this hotel in poorest catogory reason being the hotel staff specially the indian restaurant they have restaurant staff ill mannered dont no how to deal with customers they kept me waiting for more then a hour for my food they were busy in serving other english people after one hour we left from restaurant mention to the manager next they charge 50 pounds to serve in room what the hell man yo are running a hotel and you running these types of policy and ill mannered staff out of 10 i will give zero 0 ,0
 a bad start with an arrogant unwelcoming receptionist the lift was not working with 5 floors to climb and i did not feel well the room was over heated and air conditioning not working unfortunately you can t open the windows as the hotel is on a high traffic avenue reception had no idea how to control the temperature nor did they make any effort to help except for shouting at us one of our worse hotel experience ever ,0
 shabby reception area mediocre staff awful brown decor horrible mugs in room baking hot in the night couldn t get the air con to work nor open a window horrid tea bags in room cheap soap and shampoo products this is not what you expect in mayfair even on a deal all very dated and tired,0
 this hotel took a sum of 81 60 from my bank account the night before i was due to stay with them i phoned the morning of my flight to query same and was told there was a hold put on this amount and once i paid on check in this money would be released i was then advised that there were maintenance issues with our room and so we would have to move to the london premier kensington hotel upon checking in i went to pay the bill in total with a different card only to be told i couldn t a manager eventually came to our assistance and took the total amount from the second card and told me they would ring the bank to release the hold on the 81 on the original account it is four days later and i am yet to receive this money back into my account despite having paid the bill in full on the second card the girl on the front desk called us a complimentary taxi and asked him to bring us to the park hotel which he duly did we were checked in there by a staff member and sent to a room in a different building across the road from the hotel this building did not have any access to wifi which was one of the reasons that we booked the notting hill hotel this was very inconvenient for my travel partner and i the water in the shower was cold and when i went to bring this to the attention of a staff member at the park hotel i was told we had been checked into the wrong hotel but why was this not communicated to me when i was being checked in there this whole hotel group appears to be in chaos and i would most certainly not recommend any of the hotels which i had dealings with nor would i stay here again have a look at the terrible ratings on tripadvisor and you will see that i am not the first one to have had this experience ,0
 pathetic housekeeping had to complain several times to get the room cleaned properly no telephone or ac in the rooms had to go up and down 2 floors no lift to talk to the reception if we needed anything the table fan provided was not enough and room was uncomfortable and too warm at night they are not equipped for summer ,0
 everything about the hotel and location and friendly staff ,1
 our bathroom was not clean at all the sink still had vomit stains form the previous client also the sit of the toilet was dirty they could not give us a new room and as there was only one person of the staff he couldn t clean it for us just disgusting i would never come back ,0
 clean smart room with a comfortable mattress friendly staff and an excellent location ,1
 the size of the rooms and beautiful ,1
 this is a very beautiful hotel i loved it so much that i had to extend my stay the restaurants are beautiful and well set up ,1
 rooms extremely obsolete and unpleasant,0
 staff were very helpful,1
 the views were amazing especially at the sky bar on the 18th floor at night the christmas decorations were beautiful staff couldn t be more helpful friendly we also tried the water taxi bus back into the city it was wonderful,1
 bright new modern ,1
 shocking cold dirty stains on curtains third room change as hairs found in beds noisy plumbing and humming in room avoid at all costs ,0
 very comfortable bed nice and helpful staff great location ,1
 i arrived very late and extremely exhausted after a very long drive and writing this review a couple of days later so it s not reflecting my tiredness that evening i was shown my room and really hope that room was the worst in the place double bed filling the entire room a kind of platform taking up space a blackened out window to a kind of yard from where there was a constant humming noise from some machinery as well as a bad draft and smell extremely poor sound insulation thin walls could hear exactly what was going on in the adjacent rooms plus when the toilet s were being flushed you couldn t access the bathroom without sliding around the bathroom door and then closing it after entering tiny i weigh 60 kg so not due to my size i was charged 30 extra for my cat which was admittedly on their terms and conditions which staff showed me when i complained about it not the amount however but not on the booking com website no breakfast is served teabags and kettle in the room over priced and grossly over rated the photos look lovely on the site and perhaps i was just given a bad room no idea was just a very bad experience and an expensive one at that cost me around 135 which i deeply regret spending didn t want wild luxury just a decent size room and no noise or draft,0
 the shower and tv remote were not functioning after giving a complaint too nothing was done they had booked a table at one of the hotel restaurant but the restaurant staff said that they are not part of the hotel and the restaurant had closed even before the booking was made only last two days chocolates were kept in the room everyday the room would have something less bad experience for the money paid ,0
 inconsiderate staff paper thin walls noisy neighbors night staff ignored small or non existent lobby very small rooms,0
 it s a beautiful hotel an architectural pearl such a pleasure to stay in a hotel with so much history connected to it it was a lovely stay ,1
 graham the bellboy was brilliant very helpful and he also took us around to show us where everything was,1
 comfort edwardian atmosphere the staff,1
 clean central east to find lost of cafe around near attractions in paris,1
 why my superior double suite should be in the cellar for 150 pounds ,0
 dirty bathroom dirty carpets broken beds non rectification of issues until we escalated 8 times dirty restaurant all seating stained showers on one side of building suitable only for people 4 ft tall or less far from hilton standards ,0
 beautiful grand hotel comfortable clean room polite and helpful staff excellent location in the heart of london great base for exploring,1
 the reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems definitely i ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel when you ask reception that can i have a bottle of water you will got right away this answer we have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back you have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning ,0
 the photos of the room and the hotel look much nicer than the reality my room was down in the basement so tiny i could not even open my suitcase the furnitures and the walls looked very old ,0
 location good for kids plenty restaurants nearby,1
 late night major electrical fault in several rooms on my floor causing blue flames loud crackling noise at the wall socket in use and wrecking my device charger night staff were helpful in changing my room but i didn t feel safe and got very little sleep refund for the cost of a replacement charger the following morning was grudging ,0
 architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels the arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space location is fab in the green space of oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the city halls the rooms are quirky with a small footprint the ground level has a closet small sofa wc and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level there s a tv on each level ,1
 wifi was lousy attitude of staff was at times unpleasant breakfast was unappetising and tasteless ,0
 great location lovely building,1
 woken at 1am with mouse running under the bed ,0
 a lot not suitable for business travel,0
 breakfast was excellent the staff were very helpful the location is convenient for access to central london and the rooms are well presented they are willing to store luggage both before check in and for the rest of the day after check out which was a boon ,1
 the location and apparent of the hotel were excellent the staff were very friendly there was a small problem with the shower in the room which was seen to with no hesitation or worry ,1
 clean and quiet room ,1
 the room was spotless was in a very quiet location even though off of fleet street only 15 mins walk to covent garden theatres very luxurious room with huge king bed enormous pillows beautiful ,1
 parking cost 21 when i was told it was free and my room had no window this wasn t made aware to me when i booked it ,0
 it was so central good food shops and close to attractions,1
 staff were outstanding in all areas especially simone on reception who ensued my mum was well looked after rooms bathroom immaculate and spacious beds exceptionally comfortable would return even if not attending the o2 it was that good thank you,1
 way too expensive,0
 this place is awful the carpet was about 30 years old with stains everywhere the walls were paper thin to hear my neighbors having sex the hotel was unable to produce a receipt and said the had to email it but i have yet to receive ,0
 overall this is a nice hotel with some plusses a beautifual old style entrance hall and bar and equivalent large rooms for breakfast the staff is efficient and very courteous the breakfast buffet is quite reach ,1
 staff very friendly and good location ,1
 comfort,1
 location breakfast served were excellent also have to mention the supper we ordered was good ,1
 basement room no natural light my wife had to exit the building to check the mornings weather each day noisy due to staff in and out of adjoining door all night bathroom was functional but very small unable to sit properly on the toilet as it was almost up to the wall the shower was in the bath and you need a step ladder to get in and out the wardrobe rail was about 6 3 high i am 5 5 and my wife is smaller there are steps down into the room when you get through the door the safety deposit box repair man fell down them the staff don t appear to talk to each other as messages about us wanting to change room weren t relayed to the morning staff the receptionist did offer another room if we left out bags in the reception area the next morning before 12noon where she would watch them for us but on questioning this she stated that she would not be responsible for them and we did not want to waste the small amount of time we had in london trying to change room last time we stayed here it was reasonable but not this time the room was very hot despite having air conditioning it only worked on low fan speed and no matter what setting were made it didn t cool very much the corridor to the basement is enclosed by glass and smells awful when we were checking out the receptionist asked what complimentary offers where we given answer none were offered breakfast was not included and what we paid for the first morning was laughable the coffee was strong and almost cold the selection on offer was very poor we ate elsewhere the next morning ,0
 the welcome of reuben and his manager when i checked in,1
 i requested a higher floor room but assigned a 1st floor room in the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock the bed was terribly hard and i had a backache next day ,0
 awful bar service and food confusion over who was booking in ,0
 having stayed at the hotel many times i like the attentiveness of the staff cleanliness of the rooms central location breakfast choice and valu for money,1
 very non friendly reception team careless rude we had to pay for the intent in the room because our reservation through booking we had to beg the receptions and duty manager to have late check out at 02 00 pm while the occupancy was low i could not use the hhonors points again because the reservation was through ebooking like we did a crime we had to beg them to have one single bed instead of twin we asked for good view and we had room 627 which has a long wall just in front of the window they transferred us to room 108 to solve the problem and as an apology from the desk manager and the view was the very close roof of the hotel i will never stay in hilton again and will discontinue my hhonors membership ,0
 everything was bad wifi wasnt working charging port wasn t near bed reception was trying to tell me to upgrade my room food was pathetic and the attitude if staff was also bad and disrespectful for room service it was additional 5 pounds probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed in not recommend at all,0
 the location was excellent and a very comfortable bed ,1
 at arrival the receptionnist told us that they had no more double rooms only twins and that we only managed to book a double because of booking com not being updated 2mins later 2 other couples arrived to checking and also had the same the fan kept running all night and did not let us sleep we complained and were told that they would stop it but they did not internet is paid and staff is horribly unpleasant,0
 ambiance and breakfast,1
 staff were very kind and helpful,1
 very expensive for what you get ,0
 lovely dining room and good breakfast lots of attentive staff ,1
 price facilities cleanliness awful,0
 this hotel is pure paris traditional and welcoming it is located a short walk to two different paris m tropolitain stations that can whisk you away to any part of paris and the location of this hotel is near shopping and many bars restaurants without any transportation needed ,1
 lovely new hotel very friendly welcome cleanliness was superb bed was so comfortable with very high quality bed linen had a wonderful sleep close to 02 underground station ,1
 the stay was a complete dissapointment for me and my colleauges at check in nobody was given a room before 3pm the were not ready at 3pm all rooms at a time became ready no information on hotel amenities from the reception staff they were just interested in credit card overpriced restaurant with scarce menu no a la carte for breakfast on weekend just standard buffet not a 5 star no sparkling wine or champagne had to ask for my coffee for 4 times and wait it for 20 minutes late check out promised by booking com was not granted besides the reception told to come later and later to check that is not normal room keys discontinued to work a couple of times i could not fond any difference between a standard and a superior room description and pics are all the same the hotel is not worth its money and a 5 star rating,0
 the room was spacey and comfortable it was amazing ,1
 the bed was incredible ,1
 we were given a free upgrade to one of the best rooms because of valentine s day ,1
 in all everything was just perfect,1
 the receptionists were not polite their english wasn t even that good to begin with the room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if i was a bit fatter i wouldn t be able to pass the bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains the toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet the location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area ,0
 great breakfast in the morning,1
 the staff was excellent the room was way ro small,1
 furniture is in a bad condition and old air conditioning was not working for the last two days water leaking at room 306 from the room above it tv was out of use as all channels were not clear housekeeping staff don t speak english breakfast can t be included with the the rate corridors are narrow 2 people can t pass through at the same time lift is too small to occupy one person with one piece of luggage of normal size,0
 very efficient staff in all areas,1
 the service was exselent breakfast exselant staff exselant roomservice exselant overall to be honest far better then the hilton iv satayed at before and it was fantastic value for money and the location exselant i am defenitly recomending the hotel to my friends and colligues and fammily thank you for a weekend of perfection couldnt have asked more many thanks to all the fantastic staff who were exselant ioannis batsos,1
 it was clean and beds were comfortable ,1
 room was very well appointed and comfortable ,1
 very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden i like the fact that it is a small hotel plus i like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower ,1
 location n value for money ,1
 this is my favorite hotel in the world and it still is i wrote the manager a good letter especially about his great staff but for some reason it could not be delivered please tell him because i name names and want them rewarded ,1
 friendly staff willing to help modern rooms and very comfortable close to some old historic pubs frequented by locals rather than tourists ,1
 every thing,0
 the customer service is extremly poor room is not what i expected regarding the cleanliness room service did not answer around 9 times very slow response it was very unpleasent stay to be honest once in a lifetime experince ,0
 so i shared my room with my friend on check out date she left early n forgot her bag i had to leave before 12 so i left the bag in the room so my friend could pick it before 12 she couldn t make it n i felt her bag was safe no it wasn t security promise to call me on 4 occasions n never did am so disappointed is such a shame,0

 my experience may not be representative as i was upgraded on arrival,1
 no air condition outside temperature was 30 deg opening windows was insufficient and noisy room very small,0
 the location is very good in a quiet area five minutes walk to metro stations or bus stops close to hyde park the staff was nice and very helpful we didn t like the first room we get they changed it very quickly the room was very clean the cleaning was perfect it s quite well equipped the bed was very comfortable we could check in quite early we recommend this hotel we would book a room here again ,1

 quiet bedroom complete and clean bathroom warm attendance,1
 hotel in general,1

 lovely spacious room with comfortable bed the provision of bottles of water and fruit was a nice touch would happily stay here again,1
 a lovely hotel excellent location for the 02 staff friendly food great out whole experience was worth every penny,1
 the worst hotel i ve stayed in recent years we booked three rooms and paid by credit card five months ago when we arrived the receptionist only can find two room records but cannot find the 3rd one they asked me to call booking and said it should be booking s fault when i used the phone in the reception i requested to check the room in their reservation system again they found that the room we booked had been checked in by others wrong guest stayed in our room used our booking records though they found the mistake they didn t apologize to us and let us wait for a long time to get another room so rude staffs it s really bad experience in london ,0
 room quality comfortable bed,1
 poor hygiene in bathroom other guests belongings still in room someone s phone sim card room obviously not cleaned properly cigarette smoke smell in room fingerprints and dust everywhere private function going on in hotel we were on 4th floor and told we would not hear anything but could still hear noise through early hours really unsatisfied considering this was a treat for christmas will not be staying with this chain again ,0
 one of the worst hotels i ve been to ever in fact it is the worst hotel i ve been to i lost the tag of my luggage and the concierge guy started shouting at me and refused to let me see which bag is mine even though i explained to him the shape of my bag and its color when i tried to explain to him that i lost the luggage tag he started mumbling and making fun of me he was the most disrespectful person i have ever seen the cab was waiting outside and i needed to leave to the airport and he still refused to find a solution and was acting as cold as he could be and keep on telling me that it is my fault not his well we are not discussing who s fault it is i just need the bag moreover the room was dirty and the bed sheet as well definitely not recommended going to london next week again and definitely will stay in a different hotel ,0
 plug sockets in room damaged previous guests toe nail clippings on floor booked family suite but got given large double with no explanation property advertises the need for lift from ground floor just past the bins for the nando s underneath to the reception but the hotel layout means there are additional steps between that lift and any rooms staff were curt but professional but unwelcoming requested baby cot was given baby cot one of the rooms overlooks what seems to be a storage area and the extractor fan for the restaurant below if booking is try to avoid it all told it was not a nice experience and if i were to book again i d go with an accor or hilton property even at least they guarantee cleanliness ,0
 bad breakfast bad rooms i took their most expensive room carpet stains what the ,0
 it was perfect for us to be able to attend the andrea bocelli concert in the 02 arena as its right next door with easy access to the 02 through a connecting walkway ,1
 service was a mess no a c and the room that they gave for us 3 people couldn t fit well even 2 ,0
 reception staff very friendly and efficient breakfast very good ,1
 staff were pleasant and friendly comfortable rooms very clean throughout on arrival we were told that there was an issue with the building and that we were being moved to a partner building which was fine the staff helped with our bags and escorted us to our new room the only thing i would say of the location is that it isn t very obvious that it s actually a hotel and there aren t any signs until you come up to the door ,1
 it was close to the venue 5 minute walk and also the breakfast was lovely all staff was great and so polite too ,1
 location great fantastic original interior,1
 the rooms were very bad also the air conditioner it is really hoot bathrooms were so small like airplanes bathrooms ,0
 amazing hotel right next to the o2 amazing staff amazing bar on 18th floor super comfy beds great views great in room dining ,1
 funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed ,1
 overall very pleasant ,1
 location was great close to arc de triomphe very comfortable bed very attentive staff faux suede walls,1
 the staff were unhelpful the air conditioning was broken throughout the whole hotel the bar shut at 11pm there was no room service the breakfast was poorly cooked and the quality was very poor and had run out of many items service from the foreign staff with vey poor english was abysmal,0
 small room,0
 that we were first sent to another hotel due to problems then another one in a broom cupboard the next in a room with a blocked sink finally back to original hotel where hairdryer caught fire breakfast in the cellar was accompanied by a flooded kitchen from the main drain oh well ,0
 fantastic friendly staff terrific location just near pere lachaise cemetery and close to metro very inexpensive clean lovely ,1
 i loved the welcome note from a housekeeping staff clean and welcoming ,1
 1 wifi was too bad 2 dark spot in bathtub 3 can t take regular shower as the water will cover the ground 4 i am 6ft and and was not comfortable using the toilet seat as it was too high for average people no human standers in design ,0
 first time i had to do that ask to change room the room i was given was smelly a mixture of cigarette and sweat floor was dirty and aircon was not working when i mentioned the smell the first thing that the staff did was to send someone to spray it with chemical it then smelled chemical i was told the hotel was fully booked but after 20 mins was given another room no smell and aircon worked i wouldn t recommend this hotel,0
 the location isn t great if you fancy exploring paris on foot ,0
 reception staff were friendly and very helpful room was clean and quiet ,1
 location,1
 great location room was spacious staff is helpfull beautiful building ,1
 air con didn t work paid for three beds and got one double and the worst fold out bed ever it wasn t even made and when she came to pull it out it was dirty breakfast room was hot and dingy food wasn t great staff never communicated with you the communal garden had 20 bin bags of rubbish and looks like it s been abandoned ,0
 are you made my reservation for three rooms and i asked for a connect rooms and the deal for arrival they give me what they call upgrade it s an old suite it has a living room with a sofa bed very old and uncomfortable to sleep in at all although there is very nosy work in the hotel,0
 wifi didnt work in the room staff weren t as polite as you would expect for the price despite changing the key numerous times none of them worked well for the door cant control water temperature no free water daily restaurant food disappointing all in all we cant recommend this hotel ,0
 air conditioning didn t work in either room they put me in got handed off to the next shift and nothing was fixed while we were out and about all day they gave me a small desk fan to compensate never got below about 75 degrees in the room tiny bathroom about an 8 min walk to queensway sub stop leicester gate sub stop is closed through july 2017 not a 4 star experience ,0
 location weel trained friendly staff special mention to diego i think who checked us in ,1
 very old and i feel the bedroom not safe for the kids due the step,0
 nespresso machine,1
 the taps of the washbasin and bathtub was broken so it was always too hot water coming from the taps although i said it to staff 3 times they didnt fix it there was no place to hang the shower it wasn t possible to even wash my face because of very hot water there was cracks on the walls of the hotel not renovated i don t recomment it ,0
 i arrived late to be told had an upgrade to a room with a king size bed after the worlds slowest check in i opened my room door to find two twin beds i phoned reception to ask to be moved to a room with a double bed that i had booked reception informed they had no more rooms available however they would make my twin beds into a double the lady on reception and a waiter arrived to make the bed it took them 45 minutes meaning i didn t get into my room until 10 30pm a night check out was incredibly slow the lady on the desk took around 15 minutes to check people out ,0
 clean and great location ,1
 we arrived back at the hotel on day 2 of our trip to find a live cockroach on the floor we were given a different room but we never expected to see a cockroach in our room although the hotel looked relatively clean and tidy it obviously wasn t we were not offered any compensation for this and hardly an apology it felt like this happens more often than not would definitely never recommend or return ,0
 the location,1
 fab location fab staff,1
 the room was so comfortable that we were happy to stay in on first night we arrived ,1
 extensive breakfast buffet with pots of coffee very interesting story about history of hotel quiet and priced well hop on hop off stop closeby ,1
 room stank not clean at all and staff so disinterested ,0
 better room than expected apparently just refurbished,1
 took 212 deposit with out telling me which will take 15 days to be returned small rooms unfriendly staff,0
 upgraded us to the suite excellent service,1
 the hotel is situated in quite a run down location but still charge a premium price rooms were on the small side and even though it said i booked a king suite the bed was actually only a double the sheets were covered in hairs and fluff and also had a burn hole in stayed for two nights and bed sheets were not changed during our stay the room in general was ok smart enough looking but with a weird layout sink separate from the actual toilet bathroom staff were preoccupied with phones or friends but were nice curtains were broken and didn t actually shut fully or match toilet was very loud when flushing wouldn t stay again should be half the price they may think about staying again ,0
 the reception area was beautiful nice friendly staff,1
 small breakfast room chipped and cracked wine glass in room ordered taxi for morning trip to station and was promptly forgotten musty damp smell in room particularly bathroom,0
 upgrade and free breakfast,1
 tiny room with bad smell ,0
 it s my home in paris six years each year i live here thanks for everything ,1

 everything was so disgusting that i d go for expedia next time ,0
 very comfy bed and soft towels location to 02 superb,1
 hotel in great location for public transport and shopping staff was very friendly great standard bed was very comfortable and the room was clean ,1
 not as showing in the pcitures false advertising quer still under investigation with booking com but so far unhelpful do not book,0
 the breakfast was lovely had everything i could think of i only wish i had a bigger stomach to fit it all in ,1
 the duck ,1
 no choice of pillows surround sound or soundproofing all were advertised we were in what could be used as an adjoining room and the noise from the room next door was ridiculous just from them chatting and kept us awake until gone 1 am we mentioned this upon checkout and were told to mention it when checking in next time i was so tired when i got home it would have been more relaxing to spend the weekend with my hectic six year old rather than have this break ordered breakfast to the room and pancakes were burnt and the building itself is still a construction site which isn t mentioned anywhere when booking so sitting outside in the sunshine as pictured is not possible ,0
 all else was greatthere was a problem in the dining room at dinner on a sunday night there was no decaffeinated coffee and there seemed nothing could be done about it as the machine they used only took one kind of coffee the machine in other area only made large quantities i had invited a friend for dinner i discussed with dr manager and he deducted an amount from our bill but it seemed totally ridiculous clearly the pm had not done the job he she should the breakfast guests on monday would have an issue too,1
 everthing is so bad the room is very small breakfast is poorly there is a no garson breakfast time here is like 4 star hotel,0
 price ac and cleanliness of room,0

 rooms were very poor inc bathroom for price that we paid ,0
 location,1
 ok,1
 same size room as a hostel 4 times the price wifi did not work never stayed anywhere in europe with a 2 foot bathroom where the shower head was over the toilet huge difference from our first 4 days in london at the park plaza hotel same price total 180 night and day of size quality of facility etc ,0
 the room the staff everything,0
 location friendly helpful staff luxurious room with special little touches ,1
 staff were extremely helpful and welcoming building was beautiful,1
 shockingly poor quality of the renovation work towel rails falling off walls and no sound proofing also paid extra to upgrade room to with bath but the hot tap had been disabled and the shower water was only luke warm key machine on door didn t work properly and room service food was left in corridor all night and still there after 9 when we went to breakfast ,0
 the bed was amazing and the showers in the swimming pool too ,1
 the room was big spacious and the bed extremely comfortable the bathroom was similarly huge and had a great standalone bath as well as waterfall shower,1
 the room was big enough for all family 2 2 good location,1
 excellent location,1
 maybe i m completely out of touch with expectations and prices of london hotels but to pay approx 100 euro for the privilege to stay in an worn out shoebox of a room and the sweet surprise of being told the hotel does not serve breakfast oh the joy ,0
 the hotel is run down corridor carpets completely worn out one lift out of order throughout all stay transferred to a refurbished room no hanger in bathroom no luggage bench hot and cold water irregular flow in shower spent a lot of money with poor results,0
 well located for underground and easy link to central london,1
 very small room uncomfortable did not have even glass kettle refrigerator safe and etc ,0
 brilliant location and decor very grand as the name suggests perfect location for winter wonderland tube station around the corner ,1
 first of all i searched alot of hotels through booking and i chose this hotel based on customer reviews 8 3 from the first moment i arrived to this hotel i could tell this is not a 4 stars hotel by any mean and i could not understand why people rated it for 8 3 bad attitude from staff in check in and room cleaning is horrible first night when i came back to my room late at night there was a big dirt stain on my bed cover and guess what they only flipped the bedcover to the other side this is not only bad service but also cheating customers after complain so many times they start to do it better but not good enough to 4 star hotel standard the towels in the bathroom totally overused and i had skin allergy i had the worse vacation in my life in this place they ruine my anniversary and birthday celebration mood and most importantly if you want to leave the hotel they wont refund you money because its non refundable booking so where is your rights is customer if you dont like the place there is non you are just stuck with it if you are looking for nice hotel dont ever think of this hotel ,0
 cleanliness is perfect room is very good,1
 funny smell short and uncomfortable beds non functioning ac constant temp of 26 degrees celsius with an outside temp of 8 degrees ,0
 location,1
 breakfast was the worst i cooked breakfast i have ever had room was tiny ,0
 the service was very good,1
 the hotel was not bad but not like great hotels,0
 very rude night manager pretending he is a nightclub bouncer a terrible welcome by all staff no smiles no hello nothing like a prison camp,0
 room vere smol,0
 friendly staff,1
 terrible room tiny not big enough for two bed very small and so soft you roll to middle very noisey outside and no soundproofing between room ,0
 we loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling ,1
 great customer service offered at reception quick and very polite upgraded to an excellent club room free of charge i would happily visit the hotel again ,1
 booked double room with a travel cot only to find that i ve been upgraded to a triple room with no travel cot i had to figure out how my 10 month old son to sleep staff didn t resolve the problem for our stay operation manager is impossible to find staff is useless the cot offered from staff at 11pm had no mattress and since they were fully booked i had to either figure it out by myself or go outside looking for another hotel in order to complain you need to speak to the operation manager called rory who is nowhere to be seen during our stay i ve been offered 10 off from my next stay but even the receptionist said you wouldn t stay here again right i wouldn t expect such horrible experience from a 4 star hotel i would never stay there again and i would never recommend it to anyone if i exclude the travel cot situation this hotel offers nothing as a 4 star tiny rooms mold in bathroom and flickering light in the shower ,0
 they have followed through special requests comfortable bed wide choices for breakfast and very clean ,1
 the hotel provides outstanding service and is in the heart of the theatre district and just steps from the savoy hotel covent garden martket and a bridge to the west bank with all its food carts excellent restaurants surround the hotel and the hotel itself houses outstanding restaurants and a bar with novalty drinks served until midnight ,1
 for the size of hotel and the number of guests that must have been staying breakfast was excellent ,1
 the staff,1
 2 tvs in the room ,1
 breakfast was good not a massive variety but was enough five minute walk to norte dame and back streets to very reasonable set price menu at restaurants ,1
 room size very small bathroom you couldnt physically get in without having to stand over the toilet to close the door bar very basic poor quality of towels bed sheets etc ,0
 right next to the o2 the place is new and stylish great views from the plush bar,1
 very good location and professional staff,1
 our upgraded room was average to say the least,0
 everything about the hotel was not nice from the staff to the room and tiny lift the bathroom was dirty and the rooms are too small as are the bathrooms noisy hotel and very expensive wifi unreliable ,0
 lady on check in was rude lied to us about the suite we had booked i ve stayed at the hotel before wifi didn t work throughout the bedroom as an international traveler i had to use my data roaming and have racked up a bill for that shower was not clean bed was half made when we got there tv broke at 11pm and whilst the technician did his best and did manage to fix it in about 10 minutes we had to get dressed and be inconvenienced whilst it was fixed avoid this place like the plague i stay in at least one hotel a week and this was my worst experience in 2016 by far ,0
 excellent location ,1
 excellent hotel staff was very friendly we never had to wait more than a minute to be served food was fantastic we would definatly go back again ,1
 room was nice good room service menu good location ,1
 only thing was my bill stated we had booked bed and breakfast but i thought it was only the room so missed the breakfast,0
 the bedroom and entire floor we were on had a distinct and overpowering smell of marijuana the television in the room was broken we were in the basement of the hotel so every time someone else on another floor used the toilet or shower we could here the pipes,0
 great location clean and beautiful friendly and helpful staff ,1
 room quality,1
 staff were rude and unhelpful,0
 breakfast was above and beyond never seen anything like it room was perfect service was perfect clean bright everything you could need refrigerator microwave huge bathtub ,1
 location and the staff,1
 staff could have been more friendly and helpful they were cold and aloof ,0
 no option for none eating pork bed not comfy rooms small not as clean as i thought and a bit pricey for what we got breakfast was cold and late to the room noise from outside no view premier in is better ,0
 the housekeeping came in said my room evin i put the sine don t disturb and this is not the first time the happened although i talked with receptionist last time but they look doesn t care and my friend in the other room his mobile was stolen ,0
 incredibly noisy from 11pm 6am from shouting in the hallways to pub closing club closing refuse vans motorcycle couriers traffic etc worst night s sleep ever hotel staff polite but requests and questions that went unanswered wouldn t return ,0
 tiny tiny tiny room small single very uncomfortable bed almost non existent wi fi connection no tv signal nowhere to hang clothes not enough room to store luggage and move around room no bedside table lamp no air con and window sealed off surly breakfast staff this particular room was not really fit for purpose and not worth the money despite the location ,0
 thank you for the fab birthday balloons and wine left in the room to celebrate my sisters 30th birthday a lovely touch for our stay ,1
 the location was amazing,1
 very helpful restaurant staff,1
 the staff were very friendly helpful and welcoming,1
 d cor is incredibly old they are not investing in any type of renovations very basic channels offered on tv don t know why but really slow to load a channel don t recommend to take the breakfast option it s very expensive considering what they offer wifi in the lobby area is free but only for 30 minutes in the rooms you get 20 minutes per day and if you buy a voucher it s 7 pounds per day and only works for one device overall i won t come back again in my next visit to london for sure there are better options than the britannia with a better price ,0
 location new and well decorated,1
 the lady s did not respect me and the hotel reception,0
 the location is excellent the stuff is friendly and overall the service was very good the room is clean and comfortable,1
 it is not a 4 star hotel it is a 3 star depressing hotel,0
 wee were invited to upgrade to a suite for an extra 25 per night and it was a good recommendation the restaurant was excellent quality and not too expensive ,1
 no swimming facilities open one of the reasons i booked this hotel rooms were tired and dirty key cards didn t work well noisy woken in the night by invoice being pushed between the door and door frame difficult to find correct lift to bedroom,0
 don t bring water to room more than one time even if you book the room for 4 night ,0
 location staff ,1
 not a family room false fire alarm going off att 2 in the morning with no staff telling everyone what was going on judging by other reviews this is a regular occurrence and also no apology in the morning paid 14 95 for breakfast per person however at the hotel it was 11 95 therefore don t book this through booking com our basement room was next to the lift so we could hear this all night,0
 very dirty and smelly,0
 good location close to metro clean room nice cafe just around the corner,1
 nothing else was to my expectation at all i will not rate this hotel more than three star poor value for money ,0
 great value for business overnight and only 5 10 minute walk to paddington station,1
 we really loved staying at the grandroyle hotel it was amazing,1
 wi fi not working,0
 the staff were very obliging and provided a good service restaurant looks out onto a well kept garden which would be lovely in summer ,1

 great hotel lovely polite staff very good location,1
 room was extremely small not value for money paddington area was grubby ,0
 excellent service we arrived at 11 30 am and we were still allowed to check in staff very helpful and polite we love the apex hotel,1
 i stayed there for three nights and after the first night my room wasn t cleaned at all ,0
 room without a real window they charged the room twice on the credit cards and did not pay back yet,0
 staff gave out a key to my room to a complete stranger who then moved in and hung his clothes next to mine in wardrobe and put his toiletries next to mine in the bathroom i returned to my room late evening to find all his bags and stuff intermingled with mine and i was horrified no one at reception answered my calls and i had to get a very kind man in room service to go to reception and make them call me had to move rooms in case weirdo came back horrendous experience hotel system failure ,0
 the place is completely mismanaged the property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service the restaurant service is the worst i have ever experienced the staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently the hotel has many strange design choices too had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet shower overflows all over bathroom quickly you can see into the urinals from the reception area loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs this is the only negative review i have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management ,0
 staff was an issue not very professional from all angles from dress code to manners gave impression of great view when it was limited to the high end to access the expensive brands ,0
 great atmosphere,1
 old and tatty carpet dirty shower old and almost impossible to get the water temperature right breakfast only from 7 ,0
 the location was great next to waterloo and very close to the london eye you can walk to big ben in about 5 minutes breakfast was excellent with a good choice our room was quiet and the bed was comfortable quick check in and out ,1

 great place and staff were very friendly ,1
 nothing,0
 bed extremely hard room quite small compared to other hotels we have stayed in this year room shabby in places light bulb out in bathroom soap tray broken ,0

 the location was feeling unsafe due to the markets put up in front the hotel staff were rude and unfriendly we had room cleaning done while we were away and put the dnd sign on the door we were made to wait 4hours for the room when we reached the place ,0
 for a special occasion this will always be my first choice in london ideally placed for shows or covent garden excellent service lovely lobby bar for drinks ,1
 hugely comfy beds great view perfect for the 02 with direct access good transport choices closeby,1
 great location quiet yet very central good staff on reception clean and comfortable rooms and a nice character hotel with the lily langtry history,1
 there was no bath in the bathroom showers only not suitable for a lady having just had her hair done how about relaxation after a long day out poor for a hotel of this standing that you have to specify that you want a room with a bath classic rooms are small and decor is cold climate control difficult to operate varies from too hot to too cold and very noisy for a modern system bathroom grim colour scheme ,0
 our room over the street on a busy city square was very noisy into the wee hours of the night the winter wind howled through cracks in the windows the shower controls were too modern in the sense that it was needlessly difficult to figure out how to operate them the deep valley bed offered no comfort the owners hadn t bothered to correct their front signage that incorrectly stated that breakfast was included ,0
 very neer from transport options bus and metro good breakfast if you only want a bed and breakfast is expensive for that ,1
 amazing staff great customer service spacious clean and comfortable room ,1
 one bed was broken room 801 triple room breakfast was average everyday is the same breakfast the toilet location is very bad no space for the other leg,0
 we were 3 in the bedroom and my daughter had to sleep on a convertible sofa this means there was no space left in the room the bathroom is very small for this type of hotel and could have certainly be cleaner we did not take the breakfast there as the price was much too expensive ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely all very clean ,1
 very quiet and comfortable and convenient for the o2,1
 room was very clean and bed very comfy except for the pillows but that may be a personal thing i was given a free upgrade on check in which made my stay staff were friendly and helpful at all times the location of the hotel to the tube and bus station was amazing being less than a 5 minute walk i would certainly return ,1
 cleanliness attitude of reception staff rooms too hot broken sink very dated bathrooms should have stayed at churchill or radisson blu,0
 room was very small and cramped they do not have parking you either park on the street which is impossible or use the public parking garage which is where they sent me when we arrived at 11 pm that is over 4 block away returned to the car the next morning to find the side window smashed in and my small digital camera which was in the console was stolen with all our vacation picture on it ,0
 we were very pleased with the hotel and were especially pleased at the spaciousness of the standard room and the quietness of the bedrooms and corridors ,1
 nice room very quiet in the night the bed was comfortable we particularily liked the bath tub and the small refrigerator the breakfast buffet was good the cold juice and water offered free of charge in the early afternoon was nice my daughter especially liked the pc and the candies in the reception area ,1
 rooms are very congested booking com confirmed the size of the room as 35 square meters however it was not even half the size bathroom is so small you can t even move the staff were not supporting courteous location is not great as well ,0
 or bedsheets and towels were smelly we wanted to use the pool for relaxation and even though it says no running no jumping there were kids jumping and the staff didnt do anything our wc was blocked beds were old pillows were terribly thin that we both woke up with ache we complained while checkout they they did not do anything i will never stay in a hilton again as you pay lots and get nothing ,0
 absolutely terrible service and room was in very bad condition ,0
 the staff i told the front desk it was my birthday which it was and no complimentary treats cake wine voucher for a dinner night or thank you s to me for choosing this place then someone or housekeeping sole my diamond ring the front desk manager was less than helpful in resolving the situation and had no sense of urgency oh did i mention that their security door equipment didn t work to modify who goes in and out of the room the interior of the room is soooooo out dated for what they charge per night the layout of the room didn t make sense either there s no outlets by the bed you have to lay at the foot of the bed to use the desk outlet or the t v s usb the view i had was horrible this hotel was the worse experience i d ever had in all my years of traveling i do not recommend you waste your time here nor spend your money for their terrible service find another hotel you will be better off ,0
 staff were extremely friendly and helpful modern and clean hotel,1
 extremely friendly and helpful staff ideal location for bayswater and queensway stations 2 minutes walk from hyde park ,1

 staff friendly and helpful,1
 the staff were dis organised on arrival they forgot to activate the door keys at breakfast was worse no cutlery no cups delayed tea ran out of tea spoons the room was noisy with cars passing by all night and a sound of flashing toilet was on part of the night my sleep was a nightmare i wish if staff would be trained to take care of guest from entry into the dining room to furnishing them with all their breakfast needs before they go to the next than the current situation where they are more than six but allover following each other with tasks half done ,0
 very very rude staff,0
 room very small in corner location sink holding water fixtures and fittings very worn room cleanliness poor during the night the fire alarm activated and we had to exit to the muster point we were met by a large group of drunk barnsley footballers and supporters but no hotel fire marshall after some time we returned to reception and had to find a member of staff who told us a call point had been smashed but that this was malicious the fire brigade did not attend and no apparent check was made of the hotel to ensure there was no fire a presumption was made that it was a false alarm ,0
 the bed was making sounds it was a double bed but they had put two single beds next to other the room was extremely cold with no heater you pay extra for the internet ,0
 for a 4 star hotel in such a great location they should be ashamed it could be something special and probably was at one time looked dirty or perhaps tired and dated would be better words think 70 s most of the staff could not care less but some were very nice food not good at all had better meals at the premier inn could not get the heating to work rang for assistance and neither could the maintenance guy on check in we were charged extra an extra 20 to take the room earlier then allocated a tiny room although we had paid extra for a larger executive double room when i spoke to reception i was told that we had been allocated the correct room eventually but only after being very insistant they admitted they had made a mistake with our room and give me the keys to the executive double we had ordered the new room was unmistakable because of the big brass plaque on the door which said incredibly executive double what a scam if we had said nothing about the room they could have resold our room as an upgrade or similar wont be booking again to stay at the stand palace shame because it could be a great hotel ,0
 location room view,1
 i paid prior to arrival through my father s visa card when i arrived they told me i need to get authorizarion from my father meanwhile they will just do a preauthorization on the card i had with me on the next day my father sent the letter they said they released the hold on the card i had almost a month after still the amount is not released my bank told me that they charged the full amount on both cards for some reason the staff are not very smart to understand it are now claiming i stayed double the number of nights the lovely thing is that room seevice woke me up at 8 00am that day to check out and now they claim i did not check out worst hotel experience in my life ,0
 the staff went over and above for us before we had even checked in the female manager was a joy to deal with the detail in the room is just to die for it s a great area with lots to do within walking distance ,1
 location service staff and comfort,1
 comfy bed excellent bath and wonderful shower liked the late checkout ,1
 the hotel location is great ,1
 the rooms are very small and badly isolated from each other so you ca hear from all your neighboring rooms i had the luxury room and supposedly the largest and on the top floor still i could hear the toilet flush from other rooms as if somebody flush the toilet next to my bed breakfast was very average given its price ,0
 the towels stank of cigarette smoke when i complained i was told by the duty manager on at the time that if i was that bothered to air dry the breakfast was cold the heating in the room didn t work overall i was very disappointed with my stay and this was my second time staying here after a great first experience ,0

 the hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing they even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when i emailed them about this when i first booked online this was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town it is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too i would highly recommend ,1
 visited paris for the weekend with my 13 yr old daughter as she wanted to practice her french i chose the scribe for it s location and figured with the sofitel name beside it it would be acceptable we were not disappointed the location was great within walking distance to the things we wanted to do and see the reception upon check in was warm and welcoming and our room was upgraded without asking the room itself was modern spacious for paris comfortable and had a small balcony overlooking the street the staff was very polite and always helpful especially the concierge service team emmanuelle with whom i had spoken prior to our arrival with inquiries about possible language activities for my daughter was a complete delight she spoke in french with my daughter the whole time gave helpful suggestions of places to visit and even gave her a lovely parting gift a charming book in french we also had dinner at the hotel restaurant simply delicious as with the other staff members the restaurant staff was helpful polite and very attentive in all it was a lovely albeit short stay and i say merci beaucoup to the staff at the scribe we will definitely be returning ,1

 not quiet noise from street felt like you were on the road and i was on the 5th floor air conditioning is either hot or freezing not comfortable spa is anything but a spa ,0
 everything could have been better starting with the room that is nothing like you see in the pictures the building and the rooms are very old doesn t deserve not even 2 star hotel the location has a weird neiberhood and the taxi drivers will try to take more money from you the elevators are small if you have a baby stroller ,0
 smelled of cigarette smoke in room and corridor,0
 the beds are exquisite food exemplary and staff exceptionally friendly and helpful at all times of the day they even sorted a little secret room decor for my other half s birthday which included helium balloons and champagne they went above and beyond to keep the our upgrade secret too wonderful trip ,1

 very poor service waste of my valuable money for the price i paid to stay in for 5days very dissatisfied with the staff and cleanliness of the hotel quality of service was very poor ,0

 room was freezing ineffective heating despite the small size of the room i woke up in the morning to find no hot water in the shower staff came in to have a look then disappeared for half an hour i had no clue what was happening wasn t informed what was going on had to ring reception again which is when i was told that the boiler was broken they where waiting for an engineer and it wasn t their fault after having a quick dreadful cold shower as i had to leave i went down to check out no apologies as if nothing had happened i was only asked if i need an invoice or a receipt i complained they asked me for my contact details for the manager to get in touch with me never heard from any manager or anyone whatsoever i understand faults like this can happen but their response was absolutely unprofessional ,0
 rooms appear clearly very dirty very old the pavement was floating and the moquette was dirty and broken in several points the furniture was full of dents and the bathroom had clear signs of calcare on the walls probably due to water leakage from the room above ,0
 1 house keeping is not good they are changing the towels and the bed no water refill no tea refill 2 stairs is so difficult to climb 3 very narrow elevator capacity of two persons only 4 room key didt work with me so i needed to get down to the reception 3 times then it worked dont know why ,0
 i am lucky enough to travel to different countries on holiday and i can safely say that this was one of the worst 4 stars hotel of my life we were placed in room number 9 this room was badly in need of a good clean the room had stains and damp on the walls net curtains and carpet were dirty and very dusty i couldn t sleep because of the dust from the curtain there was dust on the light switches sockets headboard lamp shades and the past client left a clothes lable on the tv screen that wasn t removed when we arrived it s not a 4 star hotel which it claims to be in my view 2 star is enough three beds were squeezed into a very small room which was billed as a triple room breakfast was very poor for the price of 10 not recommended ,0
 nice warm clean room very friendly kind helpful staff ,1
 everything,0
 the location and the hotel building itself,1
 location is phenomenal staff were very pleasant top floor apartment have spectacular views ,1
 the room was depressing 2 singles pushed together to make a double view of brick walls the smell of cooking fat reeking through from the kitchens outside average staff had to pay extra for breakfast design of room was terrible wifi did not work haggard carpets in the hotel really cheap feel to the place door room numbers printed off paper and sellotape to doors its a 1 star hotel than somehow has 4,0
 great location friendly staff,1

 hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained,1
 cost quality staff efficiency,0
 wonderful pillows seriously it s been over 10 years since my last trip to london my impression is that london has become a more friendly city and this extends to all the staff at apex temple who were courteous and helpful to us ,1
 clean modern room good location,1
 it was not value for money ,0
 first room that we had we found bed bugs and the sheets appeared not to be washed properly unclean room we asked to be moved but they hotel could only fit us into a much much much smaller room it was tiny for 2 people with luggage for the amount of money paid we were expecting a lot more staff were efficient and did their job yet did not go out of their way to help not provided with a tourist map no friendly chat just gave us our room key and sent us on our way overall seemed like a dated hotel that was a bit tired ,0
 this is the baddest hotel i can t believe this hotel have 5 stars i think 2 starts good for them they can t clean the room everything is derty they didn t change the tawels it s bad trip because i was in this hotel,0

 unhelpful staff cockroach like creature in bathroom really uncomfortable bed and dark tiny room also air con didn t work just poor my worst ever experience of a london hotel,0
 when i booked it said free cancellation and no pre payment needed a day or two later the holiday inn tried debiting my account 5 times naturally it was declined as i had not authorised the debit i now incur those bank charges and bad debt reflection upon booking i specifically requested bath tubs in both the rooms i did not receive any response on this what i did receive was an email saying that if i didn t update the banking details with another card that could be debited then i would loose the booking i felt bullied by this and not wanting to loose the accommodation i authorised the debit when we reached the property we were told that the rooms did not have bath tubs and only had showers and that the rooms with the bath tubs were already allocated it is false advertising on your booking com website as the facility specifically showed a shower and a bath tub i would have cancelled the booking had i known this and believe this was very misleading by the hotel on a separate note breakfast was chaos there was only one poor woman running around and we had to wait for milk bread eggs juices etc for a while on both days we don t eat pork and aside from pastries and toast with eggs there wasn t much for us to eat there should at least be consideration and have either turkey or chicken sausages without containing pork in them as for the shower it had rotted at the bottom and we had to use towels to prevent the water from travelling into the bedroom i wasn t expecting to be housekeeping during my holiday there were also lots of ants in the room it was 33 degrees and the air con didn t work we were exhausted from the day and didn t bother to call maintenance overall we felt like we had been deceived and ripped off i would really appreciate a response from one of the booking com consultants ,0
 one of the sockets by the bed wasn t working so had to use socket the otherside of the bedroom table but no chairs could have done with two chairs to sit on and relax ,0

 everything,0
 floors were very dirty the carpet was full of stains towels were ragged ,0
 staff were very helpful and friendly was a comfortable staff with me venue on the door step,1
 the hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour the staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in paris ,1
 i did not like the fact that i was given a room on the ground floor facing the street while i had requested a quiet room when i booked over a month ago as i have problems of insomnia also i did not like the way the staff handled my complaint as they said that that was the only room available and they couldn t move me to another one as they were fully booked so if i was not happy i could leave not one apology very rude staff i also had a prepaid rate so could not leave unless loosing the money i had already paid the room was noisy as beside the cars on the street i could hear every single guest going in and out of the hotel and also their conversations the room was also very dark as i had to keep the curtains closed as my window was facing the street and so was open to everybody to look inside breakfast was very poor and the wifi didn t work and when i asked the concierge to help me to log in they were unable to make it work so couldn t work on my laptop unless using my mobile connection phone reception was also very bad so i had to open the window the one on the street in order to make a phone call as i often travel to paris for business i just wanted to try a new hotel but this one was definitely a huge disappointment i hated my stay at opera marigny i will never go back thank you ,0
 the overall cleanliness of the hotel was second to none as were the facilities and attention to detail throughout beautiful room and incredibly comfortable bed the leisure facilties were spotless would highly recommend the steam room ,1
 facilities in room broken and spa very small,0

 great location,1
 i was given an executive suite having injured my leg then find that i had to climb a very creaky spiral staircase up and down to the bedroom rooms where cold and had a dispute about bill when checking out to be fair it was my misunderstanding thinking they where charging twice man at the desk was very polite breakfast was reasonable ,0
 the staff service with a smile,1

 our friends were given the double room and the twin room where me and my wife stayed with 2 year old child was small and crammed shower was broken and we had to give our child a cleanup by filling glasses of water from the sink were then told that they may not be able to fix the shower but then some manager and handyman did fix it but told us to not to adjust the hot cold settings our child had bumped his head on the side of the bed twice due to the room size and furniture and baby cot was taking us most of the space we spoke to the reception but were told that they will not be able to do anything for us baby cot and beds were so close that our child was able to get on the bed but at times lost control and fell on to the floor but the staff didnt seem to care much one of us had to spend the night awake to ensure that our kid doesn t hurt himself badly poor poor experience ,0

 weekend staff took 30 minutes to attend to us to check us in on arrival they were unfriendly and dismissive didn t answer phone despite repeated attempts and took three calls and an hour to respond to replace a missing hairdryer toilet was unflushed when we arrived and whole room smelt we were in a non smoking room but the whole floor stunk of smoke not a good experience ,0
 everything ,1
 we arrived at 7 a m for check in the lady on the reception advised us that there is no room available till 2 p m in the afternoon we told her that when booking we mentioned our arrival time she answered i have no room available and you should have booked one night earlier we told her that we always book thru booking com at the intercontinental or regency and we always arrive same timing we never faced such a situation we sat on uncomfortable chairs in what they call it a lobby it was very humilating to sleep on the chairs as we ve been very tired flying all night at 9 a m one gentleman came to the reception he did not like our seen sleeping on the chairs he talked to the lady then she came to us and said now there is a room available but you have to pay 50 euro without any discusssion my husband paid the 50 euros and we took the room if this is the,0

 the staff were very caring and did everything to please they remembered our preferences for food and were always friendly and polite and made us feel wanted ,1
 great location for all sites in london and very family friendly kids loved the hotel money to spend on ice creams and drinks ,1
 the staff are so horrible and they don t know how to solve and manage problems,0
 noisy due to the street and bad windows doors making too much noise when closing my room was too tiny even nothing for putting my clothes it was cold and i did not manage to set the heater or it was simply not working the bed sheet at one day was dirty at breakfast the coffee was quite bad and never ready at 7 30 ,0
 we didn t like being woken during the night by the security asking us to turn our tv off when it was already off and the strange buzzing noises on and off all night in our room service in the bar was poor ,0
 space and quality of bed,1
 room was very well appointed and facilities were good,1
 staff were friendly warm and efficient beds super comfortable proper hair dryer with no need to keep your finger on the trigger convenient location ,1
 the staff were incredibly helpful and respectful the inconvenience was fully recompensed the breakfast was worth the money considering the convenience and the general cost to eat out in london ,1
 the room was tastefully designed and furnished bathroom was compact but quality fittings everywhere staff were excellent ,1
 skybar was lovely the staff were very attentive welcoming and friendly great views across the river ,1
 air conditioning is noisy the light cannot be switched off via its central system device and no shuttle service to airport or station in downtown ,0
 bad attitude for female staff hot air conditioner,0
 the bed was extremely comfortable and my single room was spacious in comparison to some of the single rooms i ve had in other hotels handy for euston and st pancreas stations,1
 not clean for a three stars and not friendly staff,0
 no running water in hotel room poor view from a very small window was advertised as superior room with a garden view see photos attached poor bar menu choice poor breakfast choice juices etc not clearly on view they were in a metal bucket filled with ice on the top of the bar ,0
 perfect stay couldn t recommend this hotel enough would come back in a heartbeat ,1
 the food in the lounge,0
 very comfortable newly refurbed room on the 7th floor very friendly staff,1
 1 there is no service in the hotel to help for your luggage 2 if you have any problem they didn t fix it in the same time 3 we booked 4 rooms and all of them in 14th flour there was one of them very very very bad smell we requested to change it many time in the third day of our stay they change it while this days we was sleeping in the rest of our rooms because we can t use this room at all ,0
 lovely garden very personable staff comfortable lounge bar area ,1
 great staff thanks for the upgrade ,1
 breakfast wasnt good enough for the money they charge extra room cleaning really bad and pillow and bed uncomfortable never again,0
 we have booked with you before but this will be the last time on arrival st hotel we were told work was being done so we would have to go to a different hotel the paddington park you couldn t move the bed was a double but you could only get in from one side pathetic the bathroom was very small and further from where we booked to stay,0
 the room price and view was great ,1
 the location was great very central ,1
 breakfast was very good and plentiful,1
 bathroom was the nicest i have seen in a while good breakfast too many tables crammed in though nice quiet area round the corner from two underground stations and two lines jubilee and central would definitely book again ,1
 we couldn t stay all night as parking was full and there wasn t any parking nearby a quick call to reception for advise was unhelpful as they advised it was unsafe to park anywhere else the hotel parking on its own did not seem too secure either there is no access from the parking levels straight into the hotel pedestrians have to walk up and down the same way as cars go which is risky and a tad inconvenient too ,0
 comfy beds room was lovely ,1
 the location was excellent 2 mins from tube and walkable to several locations kensington palace albert hall knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile we received a complimentary upgrade on the room bed was lovely and comfortable hotel was lovely staff friendly and attentive as is just off main road nice and quiet can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need i always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes i would you ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why lovely hotel for a special occasion ,1
 friendly and efficient service well looking and well maintained hotel and very clean ,1
 extremely nice rooms friendly staff close to the tram links,1
 the staff very rude girl squeezing lemons at bar looked at me like a peace of dirt while being served at he bar the boss stopped the barman to tell him instructions of jobs needed doing and i was waiting to pay for my drinks milk in room was out of date curdled my tea disgusted at the charge of water in the room and the breakfast was over cooked food and they shut the second buffet early to prepare for lunch so everyone using one buffet so big ques and scraps of food left waiting to check out poor system people wer jumping ahead of us then staff on ipads serving people behind us took 25 mins for us to be served poor service poor hotel and i ve been to a few and never felt the need to write a bad review,0
 they had double booked our reservation so we had to spend time rectifying this so we weren t double charged we were then contacted at 9 30 pm in our room to make payment when we had already paid that day the food was dreadful in jenny s restaurant buffet style bland and not good quality,0
 i ve never been given such a tiny room you couldn t walk between the bed and the wall without turning sideways there was no space to even put a suitcase flat on the floor the hotel was noisy you could hear machine noises and all the sounds of people coming and going some of the fittings were dirty mould and all of it was in need of serious upgrade this should not be 4 and should not have a high rating on booking com it is very hard not to be sceptical of the 8 reviews of this hotel ,0
 the bedroom was dirty with stains on the carpet and marks on the wall the bar area had wallpaper hanging off the walls and it just needs to have a tidy up some of the staff struggled to speak good english car park was full and i had to park away from the hotel ,0
 location of the hotel ,1
 the public transportation is well connected to the hotel location for the major sights of paris the staff is very helpful and kind clean room and comfortable bed ,1
 location and ambiance,1
 everything delayed check in after 3hours and staff was unfriendly with luggage taking 2 hours delay horrible experience,0
 my things been stolen,0
 the rude pompous staff and disgusting spa and dirty pool and gym broken doors and facilities very basic boring over priced food plus 1 bar and restaurant closed all the time ,0
 property is very poor and shower too weak and toilet was not flushing properly ,0
 very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds,1
 1 clean 2 comfortable,1
 very old stuff didn t response my request,0
 every thing,0
 staff very very polite m,1
 1 horrible service upon checked in there are no clean towels in my room called housekeeping twice and it took them 30 minutes to bring the towels 2 room is too small i guess the hotel only gives corner rooms to guests who booked via booking the room is not big enough for two big suitcases ,0
 on arrival at the hotel it was apparent that the standard of hygiene was below that you would expect from the prices of the facility the corridors were smelling of tobacco where guests had clearly been smoking indoors when we got to the room myself and my wife were uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning the very old air conditioning in the room had a damp smell that was reminiscent of drainage system the poor climate control was further hampered by the window being screwed closed breakfast was equally disappointing and the response from the staff was typical of the experience i would not stay in this hotel again and nor would i recommend it to friends ,0
 very comfortable and clean room brilliant location and fabulous staff ,1
 overall stay was fantastic the breakfast was excellent lots of choices will recommend to my friends and family ,1
 room not cleaned next day had to request this bathroom smelled of rotten eggs the whole stay overcharged on mini bar bill had to prove we were staying there to concierge on 2nd night to get into our room ,0

 nice rooms helpful staff,1
 location,1
 the hotel is walking distance to most tourist spots ,1

 the women working in the reception was too rude,0
 the bedroom size and bathroom did not reflect the website in our opinion it was misrepresented beautiful building and foyer small rooms and bathroom,1
 bugs in the toilets and dirty flour,0
 the smell of room the size of the room the price ,0
 air conditioner not working even after repeated requests for repair horrible smell in the wash basin every time when you go to brush your teeth ,0
 everything else this hotel should not be called a hyatt it ruins the brand s reputation everything is extremely old minuscule room old carpets decoration bathroom plugs do not work it even smells bad very noisy construction work going on from 10 to 6pm i guess they are at least trying to resolve the old age issue they should not sell the rooms right next to the construction work but mine was right under i also found the staff to be mostly rude and not understanding as for some unforeseen reasons i could not make it on my planned night and asked them to modify the reservation to either reimburse or postpone to the day after or a later time within the same month all of these options were refused actually booking com asked the hotel themselves and were shocked by the lack of professionalism and customer service provided by hyatt etoile i ended up paying double the price on another day to stay in a hotel which in my opinion is no better than a 2 stars my original fare was good enough that it would have only been a disappointing trip but the price i ended up paying and the general attitude of the staff i had to deal with makes this hotel a complete joke booking a hyatt anywhere in the world is usually a safe bet in terms of facilities as well as general service provided hyatt paris etoile is the exception ,0
 the location which was across the road from her majesty s theatre where we were to see phantom of the opera ,1
 room was basic no fridge or a c for a 4 star hotel is incredibly poor ,0
 small room small narrow single bed 2 pillows on bed so pictures lead you to believe the bed is bigger bad mattrass shower head full of lime so bad shower experience poor room quality for this price ,0
 comfortable bed friendly atmosphere and bathroom is very clean ,1
 small room located in the basement ,0
 for the money 350 it was an awful place tired needs redecorating not even biscuits in the room or a shower gown and slippers absolutely appalling ,0
 the hotel was special with a great location,1
 staff are rude and unhelpful can not speak good english only interested in taking your money never smile sky tv is allways broken had no wifi internet maintenance man did not have a clue what he was meant to be doing when he came to our room to fix tv could not understand anything we said and left without doing anything no dressing gowns or slippers that are meant to be supplied free with excutive double room phoned down to reception waited an hour for a member of staff to bring dressing gowns and slippers and then only came with one of each dressing gown was rough and off colour and old beds smelt musty and unwashed the wifi internet not working again which we were not told about when we booked the room the corridors are smelly and the carpets are stained there is plaster crumbled of the wall left on the carpet in corridor if i was on a business trip as an excutive i would not be impressed at all,0
 the worst hotel i ve been i stayed in the room 249 without possibility of wi fi connection everything in the room was ancient my coat and dress get crushed in the wardrobe because it was rediculously short ,0
 beds hard run down more like a 2 star disappointing,0
 location and efficiency of staff,1
 bed everything is within walking distance,1
 the check receptionist helene was very rude and impolite and had a negative facial expression rolling her eyes and talking in a low tone very inappropriate very argumentative helene not someone i would place at the front desk in a 4 stars hotel ,0
 excelent bar,1
 upgrading to penthouse suite ,1
 housekeeping services and team are poor under beds are full of rubbish rooms are dusty and beds are way too old and worn out they upgraded me when i complained however i was not satisfied with cleaniness of the room only 2 elevators serving the entire hotel guests staff most of staff were trainees therefore service was poor,0
 waited for 1 5 hour for check in after 2pm the time of check in no one even offered us water or coffee or said they were sorry for the delay we were late for a meeting and needed to freshen up before that when we got the room it smelled like poop diapers ,0
 quick booking in on line and at reception ,1
 everything,0
 staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish ,1
 nespresso in the lobby in the morning excellent location good showers very clean room quite large for london standards ,1
 the service was fantastic i was relocated to the grand lancaster gate around the corner due to some problems they were very helpful counting with a staff of young profesional people always with a smile on their faces the bed was very comfortable my room was kind of small but did not mind was good for me and for one weekend they welcome you with a fruit drink breakfast was good enough for sure a hotel to come back and to recomend ,1
 staff was very helpful ,1
 all staff were amazingly friendly one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in in the uk ,1
 thank you so much for leaving the birthday cake in the room for my boyfriends 21st it made it much more personal and special the bed was super super comfy and the room was clean the view was so amazing and the spa was lovely and quiet everything about this trip was incredible ,1

 the bedroom was small but nicely furnished and well appointed the bar was very comfortable and the service was excellent,1
 rooms service,0
 good location,1
 lovely rooms,1
 the size of the room quite large especially for european standards loved the towel warmer and having a seating area in the room also having a separate door to the hallway and bath area was really nice in case one s traveling partner wanted to sleep in staff was great especially claire at the front desk a new friend for when we come back to stay ,1
 i booked a upper level floor room but they give me a first floor disable room very bad hotel expensive but not comfortable and very noisy,0
 refurb rooms are better,1
 the architecture atmosphere and location,1
 unqualified staff people very frustrated at the reception poor location way too expensive for that kind of hotel,0
 we liked how the hotel is presented on booking com we made a reservation based on that however the reality is that the hotel offers totally different rooms than advertised and in fact the hotel rooms are terribly different and worse than the ones booking com present the hotel managers chose the nicest rooms and put them on booking com after making the booking and arriving to the hotel we faced an total shock the hotel room was awful it didn t even remotely looked like the photos the hotel room looked incredibly old it was a total extreme you can take a look at the advertised photos and compare them with the photos of the room there s captured the bathroom we have been given when we complained about this to the hotel staff the were rude to us insulted my girlfriend and couple times lied to us straight to the face along with the hotel manager later when solving the matter the hotel charged us for the stay didn t refund anything the booking com team said that they apologize they didn t do anything and keep supporting the hotel on their website we have been scammed by this advertisement stay away from from this hotel ,0
 the staff were very good and very helpfull,1
 the hotel itself,1
 we need to leave our huge suitcase when we trip to spain but the manager of this hotel refused it because we were not coming back to their hotel eve though we stayed for long time and checking out and coming back again during two weeks and introduced many friend to stay their hotel i would suggest to them that the customer service should not be followed manual all the time but they must be flexible to being as customer centric otherwise they never create a competitive customer experience in the future ,0
 the hotel was excellent,1
 buckets in the entrance fire alarm went off at 1 05am very poor organaisation when evacuated nobody took a register of guests no instructions from staff of what was going on very poor from a safety point of view breakfast was waiting for certain items of a full english rooms require up dating modernising ,0
 the wooden floors made it so you could hear everything in the next room we had a door adjoining the next room to ours which we had to ensure was locked everyday after the cleaners had been to ensure whoever was in 205 couldn t get in and on the saturday night a lady in 205 was playing the tv loud and laughing until late beds were really uncomfortable and kept moving away from the wall i checked out early on the sunday instead of the monday as could not bare to stay another night ,0
 the room was far too hot and stuffy tried turning the air down and it would reset itself back to hot terrible night s sleep other guests at the breakfast buffet and the staff working were generally pushy and rude also really unsanitary ,0
 i asked for three beds for three men and we were given only 2 beds one rolled over sofa which was extremely uncomfortable rusty taps in bedroom very loud aircondition even our executive room was tiny and we paid a lot of money for this discomfort ,0
 very good location nice quiet neighbourhood friendly staff and good breakfast ,1
 bed was comfortable location is excellent ,1
 where do i start staff are rude bar staff are overly friendly which felt uncomfortable at times no good communication between staff i requested a heater as it s cold in the room and i didn t revive one until 2 hours later after calling 3rd time and there were more than 1 member of staff working that evening i was given false information in regards to the issue don t be telling me you will be right up in a few minutes when you won t be up until another 2 hours the manager is rude however the general manager is nice he knows more about customers rights and needs than anyone else working there poor guy has no power though not good value for money ,0
 we found the hotel to be ideally located near to bus and tube stations and the hammersmith apollo all of which are in walking distance our room was large with a comfortable king size bed there was an adequate choice on the dinner menu and plenty of choice for breakfast catering for most nationalities the receptionists and waiting staff were very friendly ,1
 the bus stop in front of the hotel entrance was a bit off putting and that the walk to the underground on heels was a little uncomfortable ,0
 the room was worn down and dirty there was dust the aircon was not functional the pain in the bathroom was with mould,0
 air con could have worked room was very humid and poorly ventilated even with the window open,0
 the room smelt very badly i woke up at 3am feeling unwell as it was so overpowering,0
 room not nice but nice at all bathroom worse,0
 some staff is really rude and rooms too hot and extremelly small,0
 silent hotel nicely decorated rooms good location ,1
 we have been coming to this little hotel for some time now and are pleasantly surprised at the improvements over the years we loved the fresh orange juice machine,1
 the whole experience and been nearly 5 weeks and still haven t had my 50 pound deposit back but only took them 2 days to take the money out for what i consumed in the mini bar bunch of clowns that work there dealt with 4 different managers and all of them said different thins to me why the money s not in my account and apparently it s my banks fault so need to chase them up useless will never stay there again a big huge rip off,0
 the plus point of this hotel is its location which is between two stations bays water and queensway there are lots of eateries and we are spoiled for choice ,1
 it was our mum s 84th birthday and the hotel staff made a fuss of her they were lovely balloons and a card in the room plus a bottle of wine ,1
 the location is convenient to everything and the staff are superb ,1
 1 i requested a ground floor or first floor room due to mobility problems when we arrived we were told our room was on the third floor there is no lift we were then offered a room in the basement which was small the bed was small the wardrobe was small the bathroom was in a closet 2 the following morning we went for breakfast at approx 9 15am we were told without apology that breakfast finished at 9 00am it was not possible to get coffee juice toast we were told to make coffee in our room 3 my husband fell out of the bed during the night he is used to a normal sized double bed 4 staff did not care this was supposed to be a 4 star hotel and i would rate it as a 2 star we will certainly not stay there again ,0
 the staff and the englishness,1
 bed was amazing the staff were very welcoming and friendly and room was lush,1
 total mis representation by booking com all guests i spoke to were unhappy,0
 large and great amenities,1
 smell of the room cigarette smell in the stairs corridors suspicious staff general feeling,0
 location is not great,0
 very luxurious and modern facilities beds were huge and the whole room was spotless rain shower was amazing and the price for the location was unbeatable ,1
 the room is too small no sound proof too noisy drinking water is not available one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in ,0
 the location of the hotel was brilliant for the o2 the room was large with good facilities great bedding too the bathroom had a bath as well as a shower toiletries provided plus robe and slippers it was our anniversary and they d left us a small cake which was a great touch the staff were very helpful and polite we couldn t really have asked for more ,1
 the mattress was extremely uncomfortable we got hardly any sleep all night ,0
 this is an excellent hotel in terms of its facilities the breakfast was very good ,1
 worst service ever very small room empty minibar for three days despite i asked to fill it as it should no shampoo and i aske for it four calls and two hours wait to have a plug adaptor unfriendly personnel poor breakfast and overcrowded brekfast room never again for 282 gbp doesn t worth this rate,0
 the cleaning women always mess up my stuff like shoes bottles contact cups and prrsonal stuff also no bottle waters even the hot pot is dirty they even broke in to clean the room even i was still in my room with hanger on door on the other hand they did not come to clean even i remove the hanger on door no new body wash and shampoo supplyment jesus the worst experience i ve ever had ,0
 the bed was really comfortable the showers were good the staff were very pleasant,1
 room in terrible condition,0
 restaurant bar didn t have any dry white wine other than the house which was mediocre at best every option i asked for they were out only one salad option no soup but i could have walked to plenty of other places in the area now wished i had room was very warm and stuffy on arrival the room thermostat had a dial but only one temperature came out hot i don t like to sleep in a warm room so had very little sleep the point of me staying over night was to be well rested for an important meeting when i booked i asked for a fan as this is sadly the case with many hotels but had to request after check in but made little difference to the room as not fresh air to circulate and already hot on arrival i will not be using this hotel again ,0
 the fact it was central to everywhere that i had to go also it was walking distance to two underground stations each with different lines going through them it was also close to some very nice restraunts and bars ,1
 location was perfect to use the underground the hotel was lovely,1
 room is too small staff is not helpful ,0
 i did not like the fraud that they committed on my card the day i arrived do not go here ,0
 the room service was not avaible as the phone in the room didn t work the shower was broken on check out explained this and the staff checking me out didn t not care at all terrible service i will never be staying here again did not get given the wifi password ,0
 hotel in a lovely quiet area 2 tube stations right around the corner with access straight to city centre in 5 mins had a lively time and would definitely return ,1
 very old and tired hotel lazy from owners and the location deserves better it was tired when i stayed in the early 2000s not a penny has been spent since ,0
 the size and layout of the room was good the proximity to the o2 was the main reason we booked this hotel as we didn t want to travel after seeing a concert at the o2 staff were very friendly and very efficient we ate in the market brasserie food was good but quite expensive if you don t have the set menu the service was excellent ,1
 top class room and general facilities pleasant and helpful staff ,1
 location good value restaurant excellent staff ,1
 great location for hyde park concerts the room was clean and had everything we needed reception helpful and attentive ,1
 you never gave me my pif receipt upon departure,0
 bar areas were not attractive rooms were dark or poorly lit ,0
 best thing about this hotel is definitely the location 2 minutes from the tube and right on kensington gardens which was fab the staff were friendly and when we did have a problem fixed it right away ,1
 the standard of the hotel was exceptional considering the size and amount of guests service was excellent and the food and beverages were of a high standard the new evening buffet in the aroma restaurant was top draw and delicious we were glad to be one of the first guests to experience it i would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel for another stay ,1
 this hotel did everything it could with the hand it was dealt the staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was well supplied reading lights and bedside tables on both sides nice bathroom with large towels window you could open fairly widely excellent free wi fi connection thoughtful tea tray tho we didn t use it the problem was that the room was so small we could not pass each other one had to hop on the bed for the other to walk around the room if you like to do calisthenics or yoga in your hotel room you will not be able to accomplish that in this room also in staying 5 days we were in need of another bar of soap but it never was supplied ,1
 the bathroom very spacious loved the coffee machine and the sky bar wasvgreat,1
 bed was lovely and room was spacious ,1
 location quiet room friendly staff ,1
 they forgot to clean our room and the management seemed completely indifferent the reception has only one person who can make decisions so constantly back logged the breakfast while overall good failed the fruit salad test the fruit salad was composed of over 50 canned fruit ,0
 although there was a control for air condition i had to call reception to set it for us cause the air conditioner was not working properly ,0
 single room felt like i was in a broom cupboard and next to all the water pipes with constant noise plus i could hear both sides of bedroom having bath or going to toilet i felt my experience was unacceptable for money i was in room 411 and it was awlful night stay ,0
 super comfy bed beautiful courtyard towards the rear ,1
 o,0
 the room was very very small on a very busy road and noisy all night no reception bar area ,0
 went on a cosmos tour straight from hotel,1
 price too high room too small very noisy only one slow elevator ,0
 no car park,0
 the temperature control system didn t work properly in fact hardly anything in the room work so was ending up being awake all night because the room was too warm and it s winter ,0
 poor customer service ,0
 the room was good and the breakfast not bad good value for money having booked through this website ,1
 it is for sure not a four star hotel maybe two the room we had has no view it s very small for a double the pictures about the pool are photoshoped it looks much better than real in the photo cold water no minibar the remote control for the tv had no battery cover noisy shower because of an deffective regulator the filters in the a c were maybe never cleaned therefore the a c had a permanent error and was not working ,0
 the staff pre authorized my card for 510 quid also over charged me by 400 for a minor damage i will never go to this hotel again in my life,0
 location the hotel was really gorgeous to look at giving the feel of luxury but at a for central london excellent price really nice staff restaurant menu did the obvious well enough all in all very happy and would not hesitate to book again ,1
 the staff on counter,1
 the breakfast is excellent and staff very attentive reception staff could be more cheerful and provide a more welcoming greeting the porters very helpful and friendly ,1
 very friendly staff great facilities lovely rooms and very close to the tube ,1
 staff at the reception desk were rude and inefficient,0
 the overall basic and standard levels of a hotel were missing e g soap on toilet bad signage we passed the hotel twice to see it and many other normal and basic to be found in lower level hotel were not there ,0
 how the rooms were very updated with technology the view was amazing and lina who helped organise my proposal ,1
 3 nights with out cleaning the room the worst staying in millennium,0
 the room was great really clean and comfy the staff was really friendly and helpful ,1
 super service from a very reputable company nothing i would have expected less from ,1
 there location great i can walk to hyde park,1
 i was in a room where all i could hear was a lift going ip and down constantly like a plane taking off,0
 beautiful interiors even better than the photos provided the rooms are clean and comfortable with all amenities requested provided ,1
 not enough space to tell you all the hotel was shocking i m still waiting for a call back from the manager ,0
 stuff was unfriendly beds really uncomfortable,0
 everything i needed ,1
 so much dust behind the nightstands that i sneezed the whole time i was in the room definitely not a 5 star hotel also didn t feel safe to leave valuable goods in the room ,0
 we upgraded our room to executive and it ended up being a converted broom cupboard with no carpet just laminate floor in very poor condition ,0
 the elevator the room size ,0
 all good comfy bed and sheets etc,1
 fabulous cuisine and service for dinner in the peninsula restaurant extremely comprehensive delicious breakfast buffet private entrance to the o2 arena a big plus,1
 the room was very modern very stylish and big ,1
 price facilities second lift not working obscure signs for do not disturb no signage for hilton outside roof bar closed to guests due to private party ,0
 excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to earl s court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the piccadilly line good breakfast,1
 everything,0
 small carpets are shabby generally not what i would call 4 star maybe 1 star ,0
 the room was clean and comfortable the bath water was hot ,1
 the area was quiet safe and easy to get to from paddington station beds were comfortable ,1
 everything staff isn t friendly charged me 20 extra as deposit which was never refunded the room is size of a box ,0
 fabulous hotel very clean comfortable and great staff wouldn t hesitate to stay here again,1
 for our purpose the location was perfect everything was fine as usual for london the rooms are small this is as a rule compensated by generous lobbies and lounges which really makes sense as you only sleep in your room the bathroom was modern good design and clean ,1
 the room was very nice and the bathroom was not cramped the bed was not tiny like most of them usually are ,1
 staff tried to force us to move to ealing booked a double room received a twin blood over the curtains couldn t even get by to other bed without climbing over one as beds were full breadth of room rooms dirty,0
 internet isn t free front desk staff lack the right manner the asian guy didn t have a good customer relations the way he passed the pen to me was very rude they don t explain anything to the customers bed mattress is very hard and uncomfortable the room has no fridge breakfast don t start till after 7 i had to leave early to catch early meeting so i missed breakfast ,0
 the view from the room was amazing,1
 nice location as advertised the room could have been cooler although i didn t contact the front desk to see if they can fix the a c very friendly staff very close to the waterloo station but you need to know which exit is closest to the hotel it s also located on a busy street but we barely noticed the noise on the 7th floor i would stay there again ,1
 the wall has a spill on wine i was about to sleep and saw a man body hair under the cover in the morning there was leak in bathroom dropping on me i checked out right away at 7 am i forgot some of my clothes inside the closet because i was in hurry to leave this hotel i called them to ask about my clothes and they said noting was left which is not true it was the worest hotel ever even when i call reception it takes them ages to answer because not many staff are there ,0
 all the staff were friendly helpful and very polite nothing was to much trouble our room was spotless with stunning views of the thames breakfast so much choice excellent ,1
 this is not a hotel i repeat this is not a hotel i had to walk several houses down the road to get to the property it should be advertise as a guest house not a hotel so you would hardly keep walking back to get a tea or coffee i call this false advertisement every time someone walk across the room above the noise was loud really frustrating this is not what i paid for ,0
 room clean and bed comfy lots of choice at breakfast and all well cooked and presented ,1
 brilliant breakfasts served by friendly smiling staff,1
 during my stay they make a maintenance in the hotel with loud voice most of the day,0
 rooms much too small particular public at tea time,0
 i took my daughter for her 13th birthday as a special treat to see the eiffel tower we spent a lot of money on two rooms in this hotel as it looked fabulous i thought i had booked an eiffel tower view however this wasn t the case i called to reception and was met with if you wanted that room you should have paid for it i had already paid 150 per night per room for a club room i asked about upgrading and was met with a nothing is available and the phone going down after another 20 minutes i went to reception and was offered to downgrade my room for the view for the same money firstly the room we had was pitiful for a club room when i saw the downgraded room i was disgusted club rooms also advertise an american style waffle breakfast which i am still waiting to experience too poor facilities poor hotel would definitely never stay here again thankfully my daughter did get her wish of going up the eiffel tower hyatt shocked by the standard ,0
 room is very clean good facilities ,1
 no hot water for 3 nights and money was taken from my account without any notice or a final bill breakdown i can t for the life of me work out why we have been charged what we have i expected a decent demonstration of goodwill in terms of a refund for our dreadful experience but none has been forthcoming so far booking com are looking into it but it s taking ages to get a resolution staff were far from friendly and courteous and there seemed to be a language barrier breakfast was mediocre at best coffee awful and orange juice was freshly squeezed from a carton of asda value orange juice i could go on but i really do not want to waste my time on this any more dreadful experience very poorly handled not a 4 experience ,0
 the room was very very cold the heating wouldn t work no extra pillows i might as well slept on a irioning blared very uncomfortable pillows duvet was so thin i had to sleep with socks jumper today i actually feel so ill sleeping like that the charger plug socket wouldn t work properly couldn t even charge my phone next to me had to getting up in the night to charge it as i came in to check in the girl asked my name then says sorry nothing under your name needed some sort of proof of booking what like i was lying that s how it felt went into my emails found the booking ref then realised she made a error how to spell my surname when i actually spent it out for her lal is that really hard to spell i dnt want to made to fell like i wasn t good enough for your hotel don t no what image i had on people ,0
 dirty pillows and shower shower was lacking power was more like a trickle the noise outside was loud and kept hearing the pedestrian crossing beeping in the night staff didn t communicate very well we paid cash on arrival then they didn t mark we paid so they tried to take payment on check out ,0
 the air con did not go below 26 which on a hot day is a nightmare someone said they would look at it but never showed up we saw them giving out fans but they apparently ran our the door which opened to the outside would not lock there was a barrier outside and a small chain inside but anyone could have climbed over and bashed the door open the car park was full so they sent us to one down the road which you could exit on foot right near the hotel but when you had to return to it with your bags you couldn t get back through those doors so you had to walk down the road and then basically all the way back on yourself to the hotel side underground it was narrow and difficult to manoeuvre in a big car and they still charge 16 not 12 like it says on some sites for the privilege don t stay here if you want to be close to city centre either a long bus ride to the nearest tube stop or ferry ride over to canary wharf with a walk to the tube we had a drink in the bar only to find inflated prices and a discretionary 12 5 service charge we went to the bar for our drinks but would have paid the same if we d just sat down and got someone to serve us we found a dirty coffee cup next to our bed though i have to say generally the room was clean and tidy small but fit for purpose i personally wouldn t stay here again mainly because i didn t find it very convenient for getting to or getting around ,0
 absolute perfection the staff were all attentive and well trained they could not have been better ,1
 everything,1
 not maintained rooms needs renovation looks old,0
 there is revolution work and small reception they kick my family out of room because they stay on 1 more than check out time small crorador and trase is shared between all rooms without partion small elevator ,0
 comfortable beds ,1
 great atmosphere helpful staff the temple area ,1
 the staff,1
 excellent in every way possible greeted on arrival straight to check in one minor hiccup as we booked two rooms sorted out quickly excellent rooms with all amenities you could wish for view over thames o2 check out just handed over key card everyone so polite ,1
 the receptionist was rude unwelcoming and unhelpful the bed in the room was uncomfortable the bathroom was disgusting there were bugs in the shower and the shower had no soap handle which is very inconvenient and it had no temperature control for the water also the sink kept flooding and the toilet s flush wasn t working well the wifi kept disconnecting i do not recommend this boutique hotel as it s nowhere near a good four star hotel ,0
 the house keeping they didn t do they job as 4 star hotel and too bad service,0
 excellent location clean rooms cooperative staff ,1
 direct access to o2 from the hotel incredibly comfortable bed stunning 8th floor bar ,1
 dirty carpets smell,0
 position less than 5 minutes from russell square station on piccadilly line which can be used to reach heathrow airport within one hour ,1
 pillows lovely and cosy,1
 staff were very helpful,1
 what an absolutely fantastic hotel comfy bed beautiful bathroom perfect location,1
 location ok value,1
 dear sirs 4 stars hotel has good reception people nice lobby and coffee shop is not exist rooms are renovated very bad window you cant close rooms are connected sudenly you find your neighbor in your room very very bad memeory about this hotel booking com should invest and visit all hotels in parice to check the reality is the hotel one star or four star regards ,0
 this property is very run down the spa facilities were non existent the pool area is dirty most amenities not working there is an extra charge to use these facilities the lifts occasionally smell of marijuana and the room i was given initially was very shabby with very lumpy beds pushed together this hotel is totally nothing like the photos suggest thankfully i was moved to a slightly less grotty room after complaining the view from the lobby seating area is a building site with boards to block any view ,0
 we purchased a deluxe room it was unbelievably small floor space and head space slanted ceiling with random poles in the room windowless and not at all as represented in the pictures essentially a glorified cupboard in the attic it is noisy you can hear everything anyone says outside and the show outside of the tube entrance downstairs the door had a large gap at the button which meant the light from the corridor lit up the room all night bed was soft but again very small and we aren t that big people we asked for a replacement or a cancellation but the staff were fairly clueless and said we have to wait for the manager to get in on monday we only stayed 1 night on saturday overall very disappointed as it was our anniversary and had i known how small and claustrophobic the room was i would have spent more to stay somewhere else ,0
 sad face unwelcoming receptionist at night time who took ages to get us room we were told that if we are coming back late on sunday night then we can park the car outside the hotel which we did as there was no one to facilitate car parking we got the ticket by warden in the morning as we complaint the car parking manager david was extremely rude and nausty the whole stay was put to a sour experience there is no coherence between hotel staff and car parking valet services and they kept on passing us to each other no apology given it has been terrible experience with unfriendly staff at all levels,0
 the room was fantastic very modern and very neat and clean it had everything you would need for an hotel ,1
 every thing was wonderful the only aspect i would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup the beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central paris the breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order there was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas the reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations ,1
 it was noisy from the traffic the heating in the rom was timed in correctly either too hot or too cold didn t like the bed against the wall ,0
 everything the friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar it was truly pleasant to stay in hotel arena,1
 very small room lots of street noice ,0
 i found the renovations very good and a nice surprise ,1
 the buffet breakfast was excellent,1
 the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel and the room was very clean best of all the location near paddington station allowed easy access to heathrow and pretty much anything in london via the tube ,1
 the hotel entrance bar and lounges decor ,1
 excellent breakfast very clean room with comfortable bed friendly staff ideally located for the o2 good parking facilities ,1
 friendly staff very welcoming clean bathroom and always maintained warm and comfortable bed 5 10 mins walk from the tube which was good ,1
 friendly welcoming staff on arrival spacious well appointed room ,1
 loved the location and style of the hotel,1
 the hotel was spotless and although the rooms are small they are nicely laid out breakfast was excellent ,1
 the atmosphere was friendly and staff helpful italian restaurant was brrrrrilliant ,1
 your staff reception xingxia was indeed very helpful to look into our request to change our room to a better view despite of your high occupancy rates as i highlighted that it is our honeymoon trip in paris maria too was very helpful to our many requests ,1
 cooker breakfast was really great value ,1
 i would not describe this as a luxury 5 star hotel the furniture in our room was of poor quality and partly broken the staff are stressed and often unfriendly partly because there are simply not enough of them we had to queue for 20 minutes just to check in when we came back to our room on the second day at 4pm it still had not been cleaned getting a drink at the bar in the evenings also took a long time very disappointing for the price we paid i would espect a much higher standard ,0
 they had over charged our credit card 4000 lucky we were checking our internet banking and noticed this because they didn t ,0
 i don t fine the value for money,0
 close to the apollo restaurants and bars are all within walking distance ,1

 professional helpful and friendly staff good location ,1
 luggage wouldn t fit into room it was so small bath tub side was hanging off staff were rude and argumentative breakfast was stale ,0
 i liked the room layout because the bath room kitchen separated the room with the queen size bed and the living room which had a pull out couch that our 19 year old son stayed in ,1
 attention to children and nothing is too difficult for staff ,1
 the rooms are tiny and it s an old building not a very comfortable room for two adults ,0
 bed was very comfy staff are very nice in a great area high class hotel,1
 we arrived at 10 00 staff was totally incompetent was not be able to check the booking was starting on that day at 14 00 instead sending us to the another best western to walk in the rain with all of our luggages the reason was they have rooms available i could have made rezervation by my own if i wanted to stay at the second one which was on renovation later on that day i still could see they are 3 more rooms available ,0
 the staff were extremely friendly,1
 they asked for upgrade my booking because i have tow infants,0
 location and quality of the hotel,0
 quiet rooms good location easy check in ,1
 great location friendly staff and perfect atmosphere i will stay again with pleasure,1
 the bed was amazing,1
 dirty and tired bedroom the bed was almost as big as the room was a poor option for the money i paid i tried to get a refund for my second night but couldn t as i booked through booking com,0
 everything wouldn t let me stay and wouldn t give me my money back ,0
 location was good and staff were ok it is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice will go back ,1
 our first night was spent freezing in a room with no heating we made several complaints after receiving extra towels and a thin blanket to stay warm finally the manager came with a portable heater he was very apologetic and we did receive a discount room transfer for the second night and complimentary breakfast however the first night was very uncomfortable due to the lack of sleep and temperature i have recently been very unwell and being so cold all night was certainly not ideal ,0
 excellent location friendly staff,1
 not a 4 star hotel indeed,0
 basement room really hot,0
 we visited to celebrate my mother s birthday i emailed the hotel beforehand about this and was delighted to find my mother had been upgraded to a suite with great views over waterloo and the shard there was also a card a bottle of red wine and some chocolates in her room to mark the occasion the reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and there were plenty of staff around in the dining room at breakfast to clear tables etc the location of the hotel is excellent we caught the river boat from westminster pier just across the river to greenwich which was a really relaxing way to travel also visited the view from the shard which is 2 tube stops away there are plenty of restaurants nearby thank you very much to the hotel staff for a great stay ,1
 pillows were lush great views perfect for the o2 especially with the tunnel through open 5pm midnight lovely decor and detailing staff friendly and helpful jennifer on reception made us feel very welcome although the drinks in the sky bar are a tad on the pricey side the view at night is so good you get some little snacks you are served drinks at your seat and the staff are attentive without being overbearing oh and the lime soap in the bathroom was lush ,1
 it s not a 4 hotel very small room in the basement ,0
 friendly staff prompt efficient check in good shower good lighting in bathroom ,1
 sleeping in the basement and the room looked like nothing in the pictures having scaffold outside and not being told it was being renovated,0
 customer service rude staff restaurant made us wait for 1 hour before we walked out ,0
 good selection for breakfast,1
 breakfast was great,1
 bed comfortable room decent size for uk staff helpful,1
 the room was clean and confortable the staff really kind the spa is great i recommend and i will be back there for my next trip in london ,1
 never a 4 star hand rails hanging off in bathroom rooms smelt of not nice odour infact it actually got to me so glad it was a one night stop never worth 181 euros a night ,0
 the room was 2 50 m x 1 90 m with a shower built in room price is out of proportion regarding poor quality of the hotel i will absolutely advise people not to book this hotel ,0
 rubbish and food waste left in communal areas all day night rude and impatient staff who demanded to know my room number when i was sat in the bar so made to feel unwelcome despite being a paid guest was told by 2 staff 2 different times the bar was closing when i got there was rudely told it was closing in 10 barman then went on to serve several other guests for 30 more mins poor room service forgot to bring cutlery too ,0
 we got a very nice room the receptionist giulia was very helpful and friendly the housekeeping was very good and friendly i very much appreciate the coffee and tea kitchen in the room ,1
 room ready on arrival late check out no problems with check in as had made pre payment bathroom modern and lovely ,1
 rude staff value of money cleanliness furniture internet dosent work uncomfortable bed phones are not working,0
 everything was amazing staff very friendly and extremely helpful location and appearance of hotel was exceptional expensive option but you get what you pay for one small niggle which i will be speaking to the hotel about but other than that would be my first choice when visiting the o2 in future ,1
 old room old carpets old pillow and beds small tv old toilet small is ok but there are cracks in the tub,0
 found bed bit hard,1
 no early check in we waited 6hrs to do check in at03 00pm,0
 with 10sqm roomsize by far to small considering for the money it includes the bathroom within you cannot move and must keep the door open in addition the room was located in the basement with a very tiny window and view on pedestrians legs only ,0
 unhelpful staff who were rude to us during our stay when we arrived someone was being shown our room after we had booked in we couldn t be sure if they would do that whilst we were out during the stay ,0
 staff were very friendly and very helpful the location of the hotel was excellent ,1
 room were not well maintained and clean room services were worst and were not be able to communicate effectively with guests ,0
 clean and comfortable ,1
 bed very comfy nice breakfast with a good variety locality very good for getting around,1
 bad property old equipment tv didn t work well the entire stay and tv box was replaced 2 times not that it helped toilet old and not working well we ordered a double room through booking com when we came in they told us we can t stay there cause it is really small and it was we checked and we have to upgrade we paid more and the staff explained that next time if we book directly it won t happen scam business class means bigger room breakfast bottle of water everyday and coffee machine bigger room yes it was breakfast was ok water we didn t get and everyday we had to call ask for it and wait for it to come coffee no capsules and everyday we had to call ask for it and wait for it to come staff said they will try to fix things when we complaint during our stay de facto they managed to fix some of the malfunctions in the tv but no more than that we strongly recommend to avoid this hotel and will consider re ordering through booking com now that we understand you might get less of a service for doing so very bad experience we had to expend more money then we planned just because the booking com didn t tell us the room is not really for two persons ,0
 i was sexually harrassed in the lobby of the hotel on my way to the hotel gym an unsightly man wearing a baseball cap and gold tooth seated on the couch who was not staying in the hotel hissed at me when i walked by he was not staying in the hotel and had made his way in there and was reclining on the couch i went to the front desk and i had to ask they call management to remove him they were very slow and a bit of a careless attitude like they were used to this they asked me to go to the gym and they would take care of him and i insisted to wait to see him removed they were very slow to act the guy came out and confronted me and we had an exchange of words while the manager was standing in front of me proper management should have had zero tolerance for harassment and not let it get to that level and not let him the guy speak to me again i was very scared and uncomfortable the hotel is located close to the east end which is not a good neighborhood according to a local friend do not stay in this hotel i do not recommend it ,0
 i found the room dated not very clean fitted furniture hanging off the wall and a smell coming from the toilet drain i can t see how this hotel is rated as four star possibly two star and that s pushing it,0
 very bad breakfast poor service,0
 staffs are great friendly and helpful rooms are tiny curtains are dusty and dirty bathroom sink leaks no air condition so rooms were very hot that we had to stay out till after midnight the compound is nice and relaxing in the evening but very noisy in the morning with loud noises from kids and lots of banging more like a 2 stars we did not get any rest ,0
 room was covered in damp missing wallpaper lift out of use with dangerous narrow stairwells to top floor missing air vent no cold water in the room as both taps on sink were hot filthy bath rude staff ,0
 they changed the room type bed and they claimed they are fully booked so i had no other options to take the room they forced me to take,0
 staff kidss pack,1
 staff were unhelpful view from room was of building site,0
 staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked ,1
 great time at the hotel and as it was my birthday they upgraded our room complete with balloons and complementary wine thanks ,1
 staff are friendly and accommodating ,1
 see above,0
 everything,1
 lovely and comfortable staff are a credit to the place and location is handy enough clean hotel also ,1
 the first room on the 8th floor had broken window there was a massive gradient of temperature between the window and the ac fan in the ceiling they called an engineer at 2am who said the building is 60years old i could also hear the traffic from outside i was moved to another room on the 10th floor the king size bed was actually assembled from two single beds the balcony at the bar on the top floor was not accessible for some weird h s policy when i complained the stuff was so generous to take 5 off from the minibar i would not recommend this hotel it s overrated ,0
 convenient location,0
 the double room i booked was not what i expected they checked my wife and i into one which is smaller that most other single rooms in other hotels of the same catergory there was hardly any space to move in and i kept banging into the tv and the furniture and the window which looked out into some place that resembled a construction site it was a struggle just to open our luggage and i nearly fell of the tiny double bed one morning when i awoke the hot water from the shower came at an intermitten pace so i shivered when i showered i wished i could indicate a comfort level lower that unsatisfactory i could not check out earlier as i have prepaid the reception staff were nonchalent and confirmed it was a double room when i notified them and werereluctant to assist in changing my room ,0
 excellent location and staff were very helpful and welcoming excellent service throughout our stay ,1
 great location lovely rooms,1
 the mattresses need updating urgently invest in some free view channels the carpet was worn and filthy staff are probably under pressure not to vacuum other guests were inconsiderate no noise policy in place banging doors and shouting across corridors at any and all hours of the day night walls are paper thin pillows are even thinner the gym equipment is laughable just do away with it in the advert and the tv sets need to go the whole experience was just awful the apologetic staff did little to ease how i regarded my stay for the price tag it is day light robbery ,0
 near queens way tube,1
 very noisy place couldn t sleep the whole night expensive breakfast and lousy selection,0
 spotless rooms and comfy beds wine and fruit in our room was a great treat ,1
 spacious room with an area for reading laying out maps guide books etc no problems with traffic noise ,1
 super friendly staff great room,1
 this alleged 4 star hotel is in desperate need of renovation we were upgraded to an executive room that was seriously dated poor condition and not too clean the bar area also dated and unclean with sub standard furniture and service after asking for a minute to look at the drinks menu barely sat down on first contact had to go to bar after 15 minutes to order a cocktail and a beer neither of which were good these were returned discussed with the manager and not charged fortunately we gave breakfast a miss even though paid for as part of room in order not to be further disappointed could not wait to leave ,0
 nice location friendly staff room perfectly fine for central london bathroom nice and had a bath which was lovely,1
 the double room was extremely small and it smelled like an ashtray also when we told this to the front desk we got no reaction from them they should ve offered to change the room clean it better or some type of compensation ,0
 friendly receptionist quite area,1
 the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff the excellent quality and value of the food there was absolutely nothing that disappointed us at any time during our stay ,1
 very close to tube station ,1
 the room was spacious and included many useful features close to elevators which was a huge bonus was able to leave luggage safely and securely after check out staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 the bed very confy,1
 items were not fixed brand new hotel which was not up to standard of photos our door frame fell off when we walked through the bedroom door the upholstery and interior was awful the electrics were flickering i was aware this was a new hotel but it has not been finished what had been completed was done to a very poor quality ,0
 from the moment you walk through the revolving doors you know your somewhere special staff were so friendly and helpful from the hotel to the o2 without going outside is perfect cable car over thames river taxi tube station and bus station are all on the doorstep ,1
 service was not friendly and not customer oriented this experience was really awful and it ruined our vacation mood on wednesday morning we received a phone call from reception to ask us for checkout sunddenly my husband and i realized that we only booked for three nights that was one night less than we scheduled we made a mistake and felt very anxious and got worried we explained our situation to the reception lady and asked for another night stay with better price as we booked for the previous days but without any negotiations we got direct negative answer and the price we paid was almost doubled we didn t have any other better choice and had to accept it at the same time the reception lady threatened us to pack our luggage immediately within ten minutes and change to another room otherwise we would get fined around 10 pounds you can imagine how embarrassing it was when we were still on bed at that time we totally understood it was kind of hotel policy but the service was really not freindly and not customer oriented this experience was awful and it ruined our vacation mood by the way the room is very crowded and close to traffic road the breakfast is with limited selection and not tasteful at all the only good thing is the location which is about 5 minutes walk to underground station ,0
 the layout ,1
 breakfast was excellent,1
 expensive cold room and bat hroom,0
 faulty towers everything is bad room size and layout dreadful no hot water from when we arrived early evening until an hour or so before we left next morning when hotel reception informed we were laughed at dreadful breakfast asked for 2 fried eggs as scrambled looked appealing these took approx 20 mins very poor service from a hotel in an otherwise nice area of london ,0
 the hotel is not what supposed to be very very bad internet connection no slippers electric plug is not compatible with the world types we have to pay euro 10 as deposit to give us a plug from the concierge which can be implemented in the room the walls of the room where damaged as there was war in the room ,0
 food and very cooperative staff,1
 housekeeping inefficiency,0
 staff were t the friendliest but the main issues were the faults with the upkeep of the hotel lift would not respond to guests card keys meaning every time someone wanted to get to their room it was either waiting for a staff member to fix or take the stairs the plug in the bath would not release meaning it filled with water during a shower the result was having to stand in my partner s dirty shower water when trying to get clean for the day we asked for a new hair dryer as ours wasn t working and were met with a very unfriendly staff member who came to check ours before going back to get a replacement we also had a very early knock at our door with a staff member asking to fix our door this was the only thing we hadn t reported broken as it worked fine but the staff insisted on checking it while we were in the room ,0
 going ,0
 expressive old hotel close to british museum and euston station,1
 dirty and old and no wi fi ,0
 very old hotel totally overrated and overpriced they provided us with a wrong room type with very old shower with strange and unusual bath setup when we complained and asked for a change at the beginning they did not want to help and said all the rooms are the same but later we realized that the room is specially designed for handicapped guests when we insisted they changed the room generally things do not look like a 4 star hotel but mostly looked like a 2 star guest house don t get how it is ranked so high the guests were getting stocked in the elevator on the ground floor and receptionists had to come and open the elevator by a metallic tool happened to me twice and they were so relax and cool like it was their everyday routine all in all never again ,0
 lift not working toilet blockage for hilton hotel this was a poor hotel,0
 we loved how close the hotel was to the metro station yet still tucked away in a quiet area when we wanted to go out for a meal or to sightsee we only had to walk down the street ,1

 great family room studio apartment for my husband and i and our 12 year old grandson he was very happy with the room the tv and the great view,1
 they had accepted and charged us for our rooms and when we arrived they said we are big family and cant give us that room i need to take suite and no refund can be given so i had to pay extra alot to get a room they are very rude and pathetic,0

 being kept awake until 3 30 in the morning with music banging out from the hotel lounge manager drew thought it was funny and didn t want to help in anyway ,0
 the room was too small there was no space at all the room was extremely hot there was air con but it was broken i asked at reception if they could sort it out and had to go back to remind them they looked at it and brought us a fan there was a window in the room but outside of it were foil pipe insulation so no air came through the experience we had we wouldn t stay there again ,0
 rooms were not as per picture and were smaller my wife s shawl was stolen from the room the rooms were not cleaned refilled even after asking at the reception when they asked us how was our stay and i said it was not good they didn t even bother to ask the reason or apologize ,0

 we ate in the pizzeria in the hotel i had a jacket potato it was brown in side when i pointed this out they said it was fresh cooked the day before they didn t offer to change it or take it off the bill i had to argue with the duty manager the room was 29 degrees we asked to lower the temperature but all they did was open a window we could not sleep in such a stuffy hot room,0
 location excellent room clean service first class ,1
 love the location it was close to everything we definitely come back or recommend to a friend,1
 tidy room comfy bed safe great shower,1
 staff at reception seemed very inexperienced and didn t really know what he was doing and a manager came out while i was waiting to check in completely ignored me waiting but let another woman come right past me that he knew and he helped her i found this very unprofessional and extremely poor service the room i booked was for a double bed and it was two single beds pushed together i didn t want to waste any more of my evening going back out to complain after the time i was made to wait to just check in very disappointed i didn t booked a hotel of this standard to expect this type of experience,0
 cramped room staircase couldnt even het to the wardrobe bad layout of the room cramped bath,0
 the style theme of the hotel the location and the comfort,1
 the building and interior decor is beautiful and in keeping with its history ,1
 access to kensington gardens and hyde park was only steps away and was the underground and trains to bond street and oxford circus also it was an easy walk to notting hill gate quite and comfortable room and bed ,1
 pretty much everything in an awful area not safe to walk home from metro at night beds are so uncomfortable air conditioning was worthless also,0

 staff were all excellent lovely hotel and a great location for our visit ,1
 i liked the architecture beautiful interior of this hotel staff were very courteous the area was excellent too ,1
 after long walks in london we were ready for have a shower and go to bed but the receptionist was in her break and we have to wait 30 minute before someone could help we wait patiently when she got back i ask very kindly if she could do the check in she look at me and in a rude way she said i have the right to have breaks i answer yes i know i just want to do the check in she couldn t find the form i fill earlier with my details she was intolerant and very rude she shouldn t work in customer services the place need to review its recruitment process if you want to be abuse just stay in commodore hotel,0
 the staff in particular patricia at reception who can not help enough,1
 expensive bad quality broken furniture in room dirty bedding ,0
 lack of conmunication with staff in case of change of reservation they simply do not answer ,0
 1 the hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized 2 it was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience 3 the in room breakfast was not on time i was almost late on the morning 4 very old decorations not clean enough 5 it was definitely not worth for the price ,0
 i was forced to finish my stay with the hotel,0
 double bed 2 beds condition air not working room too old to be suitable wifi that was not working the staff know that the hotel is bad ,0
 this hotel is not worth its 4 stars very noisy doors slamming all the time very small room dirty windows very basic bathroom i asked for room upgrade but they didn t have any spare so i had to leave and find myself an other hotel ,0
 bed very comfy and in a quiet part of the hotel ,1
 the victorian facade,1
 the staff views location and food where all fantastic bar eighteen is well worth a visit one of the best bars i ve been to the breakfast was amazing will definitely be staying here again ,1
 quiet location though still central,1
 we were given a corner room with a fantastic view over the river bed was very comfy and shower was nice and hot the use of the covered walkway in and out of the o2 is perfect ,1
 great value for a posh hotel staff were very friendly the location was perfect for our visit to the west end,1
 the rooms were not of a good quality the bath wouldn t empty water ,0
 the original room was sold as a superior double with a queen sized bed the room we were given was small with a standard double bed we complained and after a bit of arguing were given an upgrade with two singles pushed together the room had no tea or coffee making facilities and no hairdryer both rooms were in need of refreshing ,0
 asked for a quiet room our room overlooked the bins for the restaurant lots of noise from midnight till 1am air con noisy turned off but with noise outside had to keep window shut fridge had a light on all night and noisy beds were close to being on a bouncy castle room was very cramped bit too cosy as a twin room ,0
 the hotel was clean and well put together the staff were exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to make dinner reservations for us and to make recommendations the location was good for us with some interesting restaurants and cafes in the local area and an easy train ride into the centre of paris we have been to paris many times so being in the 1st arr was not critical for us ,1
 bed was very comfortable and cozy room was super clean and i loved the fact that everything was newly built 2015 staff were very friendly and willing to make guests feel at home location was great because it was only 5 minutes by walk to the train station the jubilee line is so efficient in terms of going to other touristic popular destinations even if it looks quite far from the distance wise it only took about 15 min by train to arrive at the most popular stations like green park etc ,1
 i have been charged twice on my debit card once when i checked in and the second time after check out i stayed form 26 sept to 4 october name is eric a room 932 i would greatly appreciate if the first debit is reversed thanks ,0
 the rooms are very old my first night at the hotel the heater was not working second night i upgraded ourselves to the club floor it was a disappointment too,0
 the location and lobby,1
 rooms were hopelessly small not fit for anyone but a single traveller not a 4 hotel barely worth 3 staff were less than friendly staff seem cold and unwelcoming ,0
 1 the cleaning of the room was horrible always dirty glasses and the minibar not refilled even when u ask them 3 times 2 rooms are small and old not corresponding to photos i would give the hotel not more than 3 3 we had two rooms booked had a family trip both through booking from the beginning we mentioned to the hotel stuff that probably we ll leave earlier they told that it is not a problem some people were leaving earlier others stayed for another few days but not till the end of the booking there was no problem with one room but with another room they told that they cant do that until we contact booking com and tell them that we are leaving 24h in advance novody mentioned that to us when we said that we are leaving and it was more than 24h the fact that the other room had no problems they told it was a mistake a stupid russian lady on the reception could only say i can t help u for the moment i have no information anyway we had to stay for another day because of that there ,0
 1 the wifi was not always available slow server problems apparently 2 orientation more towards large tour groups italian french 3 the tv in our room was old and remote defect 4 the room design furnishing was old unlike the reception area pictures on web 5 after shower the floor around wc in our bathroom was entirely wet,0

 could not sleep all night as the people next to us were screaming and talking very loudly the room had a conjoining door this may have made it worse tried earplugs and knocking on the door but it didn t help the gym facilities were falling apart and very small ,0
 i can recommend this hotel friendly staff comfortable beds and a nicer location in a very quiet area lots nice restaurants nearby close to lancaster gate tube station or paddington station where the heathrow express arrives bike hire outside you can ride around hyde park the hop on hop off bus passes nearby which we found a great way to get around the breakfast was exceptionally good,1
 location,1

 not as clean as it should be for a 4 i got very little if any sleep the walls are very thin and every time someone went past my room i thought they were actually inside people constantly closing and opening doors and the noise was an absolute nightmare would not recommend especially for the price and given that it is supposed to be 4 disappointed ,0

 we got bumped from this hotel to the hyde park grand in paddington on what i am sure was the pretext of a boiler problem we were assure it was a better hotel and it would be an upgrade we were offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience we had to check in at the notting hill hotel paid and were sent by taxi to the hyde park grand we were given a basement room that was so small that we could not both be vertical at the same time one had to go in the bathroom the room was tired and it was not a good experience we did not risk the free breakfast ,0
 bed breakfast staff,0
 room was not window area and bathroom clean shower temp could not be regulated and tap loose no gluten free bread,0
 central clean good shower and bathroom comfy bed and just what i needed ,1
 lovely room and staff great location ,1
 several points 1 tv facility in the room stopped working after only 30 minutes and having contacted staff i was told there was a fault with the system they didn t know when it would be fixed this meant that my staff for one night wasn t off to a great start as i couldn t even watch the tv to unwind from a long day 2 the light surrounds for the ceiling spotlights seemed to be loose as if ready to fall away 3 the lock barrel spindle on my side of the door appeared to be exposed missing a back plate as if it may have been faulty this didn t do much to reassure me of the lock working room security privacy 4 the mirror on the wall appeared to be cracked i brought all of this to the attention of a staff member who came to the room to check the tv when i first reported this fault i believe this may have been the hotel s general manager i was told all of these points were fine the next morning when i checked out i received a verbal apology from the desk staff only when i specifically reiterated the above points no refund on the bill it s very disappointing to pay around 150 for a night at a apparently upmarket hotel townhouse and not receive the service stay you paid for i did write to the company at their registered address three weeks ago and no reply disgraceful anytime i am in london again i will definitely not stay at any of their hotels ,0
 i paid almost 400 gbp for a very small room expecting that i will have a quite sleep as my plane was early in the morning there was a baby crying all night next to my room and i could not sleep at all the walls were so think i could hear all conversation and the crying i complained in the morning to the person in the reception and her answer was i am sorry i know that the walls are thin so why do yo charge so much money then ,0
 i didn t like the staff cleanliness access to the rooms bad smell lost info at front desk no ac made pay twice my mistake and locked the amount,0
 the bedroom was very comfortable and a lovely shower,1
 too noisy the walls are way too thin there was a guest next door on the phone and could hear the whole conversation the floors were noisy when walked on the heating was also noisy the room was too warm and the staff could not turn it down ,0
 great staff great value,1
 the bed was very comfortable,1
 paper coffee cups in rooms wires all over the floor shower that spurts all over the bathroom floor lights that did not work noise from downstairs bars,0
 great location great friendly and efficient staff ,1
 old furniture and cleanliness very small room slow wifi i don t know why it is expensive definitely it is first and last time to stay at this hotel ,0
 rooms in general amenities in the room,0
 our room was the worst room we have ever stayed in it was disgusting the floor in the room was badly stained and extremely dirty the bathroom floor was badly marked tiles chipped the shower fixtures were dirty missing parts the tiles were dirty and marked also the armchair in the room was so dirty and torn overall it was just awful ,0
 good value,1
 the room was lovely ,1
 was upmost grateful for not just one upgraded room but all three rooms check in was a pleasant experinece and all the staff were too ,1
 the room was immaculate and beautiful staff were helpful and friendly the bars within hotel were very inviting ,1
 for s shirt stay in paris this is an exceny hotel and very well position away but at the same time close to all the main attractions rooms are small but functional,1
 we were given a complimentary upgrade and a late check out which was wonderful as meant we could attend the show we had booked and still return and enjoy the hotel after the room was spotless as was the hotel in general,1
 room was very cold window were letting in cold air heating was not working everything in the room was old and needs to be updated beds very uncomfortable dovet really cheap and thin 200 a night over priced overall room was not very clean stains in the bathroom and walls i would not recommend this hotel to anyone,0
 no free wifi in this day and age they charge as an extra why not charge more for a clean room or nicely made bed wifi isn t optional these days ,0
 convenient and quiet ,1
 breakfast was very good,1
 huge bath with big bathtub,1
 professional and attentive staff,1
 terrible lighting in room with eye piercing fire alarm above beds broken tv control poor quality bedding and sheets not of good standard no flat sheets and room stuffy and small i get the impression booking com given low priority and suggest this discussed as a nice room was requested ,0
 my room was excellent in all respects especially the bed tv bath etc i checked in at 7p and i had not realised that my internet booking did not include breakfast and i had to leave the hotel by 6 45am in the morning a saturday breakfast room was opening later than usual as it was a saturday so no breakfast for this 75 year old at the price i paid for the one night 198 a hot something should have been quickly prepared for me or open the kitchen for a quick sustaining breakfast eg eggs or porridge etc or given me a packed breakfast ,1
 the hotel was very understaffed and they were not familler with restaurants and local tourist attractions,0
 the first room i was given the carpet had so many stains that i didn t want to take off my shoes i mentioned the carpet situation to the front desk agent and she mentioned it was just replaced maybe it was 20 years ago had to switch rooms because there was a leak in my room by the bathroom the second room i was switched too was not much better my bathroom was missing a door knob in the morning i had to get dressed and go to the front desk to get someone to open my door so i could use the washroom had to wait for someone to come in with a tool box so they could open the door found a hair clip in my bed so clearly the room was not cleaned properly when i asked to speak to a manager there was no manager on staff until 10am horrible stay and hotel ,0
 area is not the nicest was put in a basement room which was small had a funny smell and no window it was next to the staff room where noise was heard till early hours and started again early morning staff were apologetic but when you need a nights sleep and there is continuous noise by staff in a stuffy room then the apology isn t really beneficial ,0
 being upgraded to a suite very helpful as we had two small children much appreciated ,1
 check in was quick and efficient concierge was helpful and took our cases for us as we arrived early at the hotel and could not check in until later checking out was also easy and the receptionist booked us a taxi to take us back to train station which arrived promptly hotel was a great location for olympia where we were attending the olympia horse show room spacious and comfortable and breakfast was lovely,1
 very comfortable bed air conditioning friendly staff excellent breakfast close to two tube stations ,1
 great location with easy access to the underground fabulous breakfast with hot foods selections comfy and cozy bed all staff were very welcoming as always ,1
 the stay was awful dirty room unhelpful staff and the room was too small for three people not worth the money and very disappointing ,0
 bathroom up a narrow flight of 8 or 9 stairs 2 air conditioning stacks outside window making it impossible to leave window open as it was noisy even when window was closed poor number of tv channels bathroom was tired shower over bath but no shower curtain all this in a club room check in delayed staff member was abrupt ,0
 woken up twice in 3 days at 8 and 9 instead of 11 constant knocking on the door to do the room windows locked trying to charge us e180 for falsely smoking in bedrooms i asked for an upper floor got the third floor etc ,0
 the room was not clean or hygienic the room was also run down and the bathroom was a shambles it felt like i had brought my girlfriend to a cheap bed and breakfast ,0

 clean and comfy room with excellent location for the o2 food was nice too with good service from staff,1
 worst hotel ever if you know what s good for you and value your hard earned money you will heed this warning this hotel was dirty location was horrible right next to a freeway and a dirty flee market i think this might be where the paris ghetto is it s far from the city center airport and train stations had to make at least 3 transfers to get to the major attractions the employees were very rude the door to the fitness room there was one thread mill inside the fitness room wasn t working there was no way to control the temperature in the room we had to open up the only working window which wasn t a great idea since our room was facing the busiest freeway in paris so we pretty much didn t sleep the bed was so uncomfortable nasty stains on the carpet and the entire room was disgusting it was so horrible that we didn t even stayed the second night even though we paid for 3 nights i didn t even care that i lost my money the room was prepaid in the process i feared for my safety i should have taken pictures of the inside of the property but i couldn t get out there fast enough ,0

 fantastic hotel great location adjacent to the o2 wonderful view from our very well appointed room superb breakfast and very helpful staff ,1
 i made a genuine mistake when booking this hotel and accidentally booked it for a day earlier than required arrived in paris phoned the hotel who were extremely unhelpful and despite having available rooms for the night i needed and having taken the not so cheap room rate for the no show the night before they would not allow me to stay without repaying apparently there is no such thing as customer goodwill anymore it might be a nice enough hotel but it s not cheap and in my experience the staff were rude and unhelpful shame because i was really looking forward to staying there ,0
 we have stayed several times over the years live the building its location and find the staff very helpful breakfast good range and excellent value eaten at leisure ,1
 the bedroom was very bland very disappointing as it didn t live up to its potential bar staff were friendly once one of them would serve you breakfast was awful overpriced and it even turned up with no bacon ,0
 specifically requested a quiet room during the booking unfortunately the access door to the patio stayed unlock with guest smoking and talking out loud near the window of our room on top of that the food was cold so the hotel offers to give us a 20 discount instead they charged our room twice the level of amateurism in this hotel goes beyond anything we experienced so far as frequent travellers ,0
 quiet area comfortable beds great shower ,1
 great location clean room comfy bed ,1
 lovely view of russell square,1

 breakfast unfortunately it was limited and served until 9 30am we arrived at 8 45am and had ran out of most things when you asked for more to be brought out they said no when it s gone it s gone and when you pay 10 each for breakfast but not get hardly anything is a disgrace considering we all paid the same money the staff didn t communicate with us well either wasn t impressed and also a staff member knocked on our door at midnight whilst a sleep woke us up and turns out he had the wrong room not professional ,0
 really really friendly efficient staff i went for the single room option and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was was clean and with a spacious bathroom very comfortable stay a i m glad i booked it convent garden is only a 15 min walk away and russell square tube station is just outside the hotel so very convenient ,1

 the location is perfect close to the tube and in the very center i have to attend breakfast is excellent,1

 impolite staff they offered no apologies or reassurance when they told us that the 5 rooms we reserved with booking had not actually been booked it took around an hour until they could rectify the mistakes two of us had to change our rooms because of noisy fans and cold rooms,0

 wifi was awful employees were rude their english was incompetent room service was disaster i asked for a birthday candle and they couldn t manage to find it for two days they wanted 5 euros to bring an ice bucket and they couldn t bring a bottle opener for three days and when i complained to the reception i was told to bring my bottle to the restaurant reception is not capable of helping on anything they will tell you that your problem is not their problem finally if you are going to catch a plane after your check out check out at least four hours before your plane s departure because they will try to charge you for stuff you even didn t touch from the mini bar and it will take like an hour to fix the issue we almost catch our plane ,0
 the room condition n bed pillow n bathroom never upgrade or refurbish,0

 the room was dirty there was a water leak in the room making the carpet drenched amenities were very run down very expensive for the quality ,0
 excellent bed,1
 the room i booked wasn t available the manager gave me 3 options pay more for an upgrade pay little less for a downgrade or go to another sister hotel after long discussion i decided for a downgrade under the condition that the bed was a queen type another broken promise the bed was a standard couple type shame on them ,0
 we loved the style and comfort of our room and of the hotel in general it s location was perfect right in the heart of the city with all its hustle and bustle yet very restful and quiet the staff were excellent and the service superb ,1
 the hotel was charming with wonderful history and atmosphere i enjoyed my cocktail in the glorious theatre bar before a stroll through hyde park ,1
 the design of the room was fabulous with concealed wardrobes desk etc and was extremely comfortable the flowers fruit and bottled water were a pleasant extra and the staff couldn t have been more helpful this is the best value hotel i have ever stayed at in london and it was only a few minutes walk from paddington and 10 minutes from hyde park the staff were totally professional very smart eager to help and efficient there was a comfortable lounge and a free to use smart phone and charger for maps or to book trips tours taxis etc though we were opposite the lift on the third floor the design of the entrance hall into the room and double doors meant that no noise at hall could be heard and i had a perfect night s sleep ,1
 a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff excellent facilities and flawless service the room was incredibly well equipped and maintained to nothing less than an immaculate standard i will certainly be staying here again ,1
 this hotel was very very dated the wallpaper was pealing off the walls the beds were very uncomfortable ,0

 plenty of room in the studio double comfy bed great location to westminster sights and right off the waterloo tube stop ,1
 excellent for young children they loved the kids money that they could spend in the hotel ,1
 the bathroom was unclean very basic room for the price payed the shower was awful my partner couldn t fit in the shower as it was very low the facilities in the room were poor and when asked for new things they never came no value for money considering it was no where near the centre of london will not be returning ,0
 the staff were extremely helpful they upgraded my room for free which had the view of the london eye they also left a bottle of wine and a birthday card for my partner the room was luxurious and had lovely elemis shower gels and body lotions in the bathroom i had an amazing stay and would definitely book there again,1

 the distance from tube station in night,0
 breakfast is very good ,1
 the air condition is not working when the weather is hot room is too small,0
 room was loud from both street noise and noise from the corridor from both staff and other guests when you lifted the plug in the bathroom sink it smelled of sewage bed was not comfy at all very hard the thermostat controlled the air con unit but the radiator did what it wanted when people from other floors flushed toilets or had showers and when the heating came on and off we could hear the water running through the walls and pipes so not a good night sleep at all very expensive and massively needs updating ,0
 the bed was extremely uncomfortable so much so we had to change hotels after 2 nights the lack of tv in the room was annoying the imac computer is not a good replacement for a regular tv ,0
 helpful staff good location ,1
 lovely clean rooms excellent bathroom facilities breakfast selection laid out for ease of choice staff very helpful,1
 reception staff never indicated at check in that i had a second room booked that would have made sense as i made no attempt to check into the second room ,0

 the aircon didn t work we were changed into a smaller room in a different premise without prior notice ,0
 smell of wc everywhere poor and very old rooms beds windows cabinets no repairs like 30 years or more smell is so strong that you can not breath price was like for 5 star hotels i know london is a place for tourists and idiots you can not expect good food or good hotel but if you pay 200 pounds for a night and you booked hotel 1 5 month before will never stay there again i was surprised of rates for this hotel my rate is 3 points and of course 2 star hotel ,0
 nice clean comfortable rooms modern bathrooms with good shower,1
 bed extremely comfy luxury toiletries very polite and helpful staff great breakfast choices,1
 the fact that your rooms do not reflect the cleanliness that tour recption does defiantly not a 4 star standard ,0
 30 pound early checkin like really that s the first thing you say to someone after a 14hr flight at 8am i m okay with it if the room isn t ready but it s ready and you just charge me to access it small old and cold rooms staff generally not very pleasant couldn t really be bothered to greet me in the morning or evening ,0
 everything carpet to begin and rooms and everything it is old old old old,0
 hotel very tired don t see how it can be classed as 4star room ver hot no airconditon no windows in some rooms,0

 the electric power stop more than 4 hours in the night,0
 it was very quiet and the breakfast was very nice it was also close to the o2 for non hotel food options ,1
 the bedroom was extremely small the bathroom whilst clean with good quality fittings was tiny the radiator made access to the sink difficult i could not shave over the sink as the mirror was above the toilet the hotel is undergoing major building work as a result no restaurant we booked expecting continental breakfast we were informed on arrival that we would be provided with a breakfast box this arrived but contained food of poor quality i also had to walk through the building works to get a coffee i think that we should have been advised of the limited facilities at time of booking ,0
 staff,0
 it dos not worth the money i paid room is very small and not as per the site even i could not find a space to put my luggage,0
 very friendly and helpful staff arrived early and was asked for any preference of room to which they catered for high up and overlooking the city not enough tea and coffee in the room but asked reception and 5mins later it was all replenished,1
 the smell of stale smoke in the room the dirty carpet the place is generally run down and in need of renovation the smell is disgusting,0
 staff excellent and vary helpful ,1
 not happy with bookings com my reservation was excepted got to hotel and we had to stay somewhere else didn t have a choice in the matter as we had already travelled to london so there was no going back this wasn t the hotels fault ,0
 the room was so small it was claustrophobic the bathroom was barely big enough to fit in there was no air conditioning and the room was stiflingly hot it was on the street side so without air the window was open and it was noisy really think how badly you want to stay here before booking english breakfast wasn t what you d expect from a pub or anywhere else and was missing traditional elements ,0
 very comfy rooms,1
 the free bar snacks ,1
 great experience fantastic views from the bar and breakfast amazing place to stay,1
 everything was dirt and poor quality not a 4star quality,0

 everything,1
 i had booked for my daughter and i but even though i had the proof of this i had to pay an additional 20 00 as they had booked us in to a single room the tv also had a poor picture which was unfortunate as i had to spend the evening in the room with my seven year old daughter without being able to watch anything ,0

 this is a bait and switch and a totally dishonest behavior booking should stop working with these two hotels i booked a superior double room when i arrived late at night after quite a wait the receptionist tells there is an electric problem with my room i believe this to be a lie despite having my email and mobile number no communication was made to me to inform me they did not even have an alternative to provide and so i had to wait for quite a while until they could find a room at another hotel of the same owner group i would guess by the time i finally get to the other hotel the shaftesbury premier london paddington hotel i get a tiny room in a pretty bad shape although the bathroom was recently renovated this room gives on the reception and on a window on the parking street so rather noisy and this room at the same price as the first one originally booked ,0
 this hotel would have been a great place for us to stay but no one told us of the renovation works going on at the time of our stay the outside has scaffolding up the inside was like a builders yard and very noisy when we arrived we could not check in as the power had been cut the staff were trying to make this out to be just a small problem and all the rooms were done and finished and only the communal areas were being finished off despite that i was not going to be stopping there as we were away just for one night and my partners birthday would have been ruined thank you for not informing me that all this was going on during my stay along with a lot of other guests too i would think ,0
 small room and the slow inprofessional response from the staff for the room a c problem despite complaining three times about it which took them two nights to move me for another room with a properly working a c unit ,0
 no towelling robe or slippers,0
 the staff were very kind and helpful couldn t do enough for us we would recommend this to our friends if possible would like to get an interconnecting room and bring our children next time i even enjoyed the breakfast which i usually don t as i m vegetarian but one member of staff kindly just made me some vegetrain sausages thank you very much,1
 service,1
 just make sure that you get a room at one of the the floors if you are staying here with the intention of relaxing and sleeping they rent out the ground floor to events that play really loud music untill 1am i had to complain once wait for nothing to happen call a second time and demand that they provided a new room for us as it was impossible to sleep they did find us a new room but getting out of bed to pack and move to a different room at midnight disapointed ,0
 ease of use of conference facilities,1
 the parking situation i was told i could park in a bay that i actually couldn t and received a westminster parking ticket which wasn t compensated fuming,0
 the bed was very comfy and the room well laid out with an excellent shower ,1
 well located hotel with very nice modern decor small but well arranged rooms will become our new go to place in paris,1
 it was small but comfortable and very quiet the garden was beautiful breakfast was very good staff was friendly and helpful it is located only two blocks from the tube ,1
 i only added a little request in my booking about it being my mums birthday we were overwhelmed with the view the balloons the wine and the card it was one of the best trips to london ever thank you you made my mother s birthday ,1
 old dirty hotel never renovated instead of room with window they offer me a box without windows it cost me hard time to discuss with management and extra 30 minutes to wait their decision to find a room is real problem because of confusing numeration no free internet ,0
 housekeeping services are really bad and no initiative housekeeping did not clean and tidy our room and one of my valuable things has been stolen by the house keeper also the concierge service is so bad i missed my train because of waiting for someone from the concierge to pick up my luggage from the room and i had to take all my 6 luggage from two rooms downstairs by myself and they didn t even help me downstairs the rooms and the toilets are very old and used they need to be refurbished it s not my issue if the hotel is full and they don t have enough stuff to work in the hotel this hotel was the worst i stayed in london and it doesn t deserve five stars ,0
 no windows in room no hot water extremely damp so awful smell wardrobe rail so high had to stand on a stall i m 5ft 8 ,0
 the breakfast was good the bed is firm just as i liked the environment is quite and just a short distance from good restaurants and the underground and train station ,1
 our room 210 was classed as basic double but was actually only the size of a small single room the bed was a large single and not wide enough to be considered a double bed the a con did not work fortunately not required for our one night stay shower head partially blocked breakfast was poor coffee machines out of order and staff not coping ,0
 staff were excellent bar and restaurant where well managed and comfortable ,1
 bed was really comfy,1
 everything was perfect staff were brilliant and really friendly the hotel room was out of this world we really enjoyed staying here and will defiantly be coming back again ,1
 the breakfast was just amazing the best i ve ever had in a hotel and the bed was really comfortable i do not have any cons to add i had a great experience ,1
 room was too small for a triple no storage i think it was a double and they just squashed another bed in ,0
 great location,1
 location quality helpfulness and sky bar,1
 location was great staff were lovely made us feel welcome hotel was clean view of london eye was lovely great anniversary weekend ,1
 brilliant attentive staff and the room was amazing bed was sooo comfortable,1
 unfortunately the room we stayed at was awful broken down used and dirty i booked a superior family room for 3 and a small dog the rooms had a double bed and a couch that could be opened as a bed the room was very small the hallways were also ugly and had the feeling everything was cheaply done and dirty my wife used the toilet near the reception and later told me she had never seen such a dirty toilet in her life ,0
 staff fantastic couldn t do enough for us moved rooms due to an issue without any complaint breakfast good and fresh fruit available buffet style but all seemed to be cooked fresh ,1
 the rooms were very small for a superior room there was no bath and the room was old and tired and needs a desperate refurb also the walls were paper thin and every draw and wardrobe door our neighbour opened was horrendously disturbing for us and a lie in was impossible we came back from our four day stay absolutely exhausted the sofa bed was dangerous with sharp edges and was extremely uncomfortable ,0
 very clean and tidy hotel very comfortable bed everything was great,1
 the room is very spaces and clean good for family or even couple ,1
 the junior suite had a double bed but no seats to sit on two cheap metal stools by the 1 metre by about 800 mm fitted table it did not match in any way the images on their website there was only one staff member to check us in and he was answering phone calls at the same time we had to wait about 20 minutes before we could be checked in the one bedroom apartment had a sofa bed in the eating area but the double bed was in a room so narrow that the walls were touching either side of the bed it could only be accessed by climbing in from the bottom end of the bed ,0
 furniture was very old carpet was stained,0
 comfort of the beds high ceilings and black out curtains travel phone and interior,1
 good location nice area easy walking distance to covent garden,1
 staff room service all good,1
 the view of my room bad housekeeping services like missing tissue paper none bottle of water the second day and third day of staying dirty towels remain in the washroom after housekeeping service,0
 comfy beds good bar staff onsite parking ,1
 family suite was lovely loved the bathroom elegise toiletries little kitchen very comfy main bed although the sofa bed def for children not adults fab view of the eye too amazing staff so friendly especially raphael in the bar,1
 the friendliness of staff and the helpfulness of the consierge the organization bearing in mind the marathon weekend was excellent ,1
 the number of hotel staff needs to be increased as there are so many rooms or they should improve the efficiency of the staff on arrival we waited for more than 30 minutes standing in lines to check in on top of that there are many group tourists as well so the lobby is always crowded and noisy and the breakfast is not cheap but its quality is less than mediocre ,0
 amir mateen and no room service for 3 days of stay and i fainted in the room and no one came to help me out they detect 100gbp becoz i feel on the floor when i was fainted on the carpet and becoz of this this carpet get dirty which is really wrong instead of helping me out they take 100 just for cleaning the carpet,0
 lovely building ,1
 too expensive very poor value for money very small 5sqm room see attached picture not included breakfast in such a high price is a crime ,0
 clean well located and excellent facilities,1
 close to o2 arena,1
 everything,1
 excellent location for attending shows at o2 arena excellent service from staff great facilities excellent room service food very comfortable beds and pillows ,1
 the furniture and decoration was quite dated and in need of repair ,0
 nice bed with aircon,1
 response from staff when colleague trapped in a lift for half an hour we actually released our colleague from the lift ourselves after being told twice that there was someone on the first floor where the lift was stuck only to find when we got to the first floor that there was no member of staff staying with the person trapped in the lift we are sending a formal letter of complaint from our lawyer in regard to this the procedure they had in place was either not being adhered too or was totally unsuitable for the situation combine this with the name of hilton and the situation is even more unacceptable there were many breaches of health and safety during this situation the main response we got from the day manager was that when you cross a road you don t expect to get run over ,0
 we re so disappointed with the hotel it doesn t come cheap and i felt like being ripped off nearly 300 for an old dusty and lack of amenities in the room we stayed in the duplex one on the top floor and our king size bed was made of two single beds and you can easily tell when you lie down doesnt have dental kit in the bathroom low quality bathrobes and towels no restaurant serving breakfast only in room dining the only thing great about the hotel is their location other than that definitely consider other options in paris you can get a lot better deals than this ,0
 very good location close to the underground ,1
 staff were friendly and helpful,1
 heating never got above 19 4 no matter how much we turned it up and hot water was no more than warm moved room and still no better ,0
 excellent desk and concierge service gracious and friendly and provided good service location is right at the picadilly tube line and easy walking to the circle line i took the picadilly tube to heathrow and avoided traffic to get there i rolled my suitcase around the corner took the lift to the platform and didn t have to move again until reaching heathrow ok one short stairway that s convenient ,1
 we found the hotel to be modern and well maintained we were upgrade to a suite and the room was of a really good size the view from the room was wonderful as we had the o2 on one side and canary wharf on the other the views from the 18 bar are amazing at night so well worth a visit,1
 room was tiny and dark i got moved around to a different property one block away because park grand had hot water issues then when i checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location too much money for such a small room ,0
 a little far from city center,0
 staff exceptionally helpful and accommodating twin bedded room small and shower not made for large people ,1
 old shabby urgently needs refurbishment totally overpriced ,0
 the room was absolutely freezing i was told the heating was off for the time of the year in the bathroom the hot water tap at the sink wouldn t work and i had to boil some water for a hot shave at 6 30 am i was wakened by the horrendous sound from an air vent in the ceiling i assumed it would go off after a few minutes but two and a half hours later it was still on it was so loud the tv could only be heard when the volume was at level 50 when i booked out there was no duty manager to complain to i will never return to this hotel ,0
 the property is verrrrry smallllll and bad i coud not move insode the room oh my god,0
 room was tiny,0
 the hotel staff were excellent and the hotel was truly 5 stars the rooms are very comfortable and roomy and very clean the hotel has all mod cons built in the tv s are excellent with showing most common channels including bt sports 1 2 the sky bar on the 18th floor is just amazing the views over the thames and of canary wharf was simply stunning the hotel is right next to the o2 and you can see the dome roof right next to the hotel it is amazing ,1
 staff were brilliant rooms spacious proximity to where we were going amazing and free rubber duck ,1
 the location is very good the bedroom is small but very clean and comfortable ,1
 we had booked a double room with 2 beds instead upon arrival we were given a room with one double bed when we complained about it we were simply told that our selected room type was not available and that we did not have any other option this was totally unacceptable but nobody seemed to care ,0
 outstanding customer service comfort in the rooms and the public areas of the hotel and just that feeling of being made to feel welcome every day ,1
 fantastic hotel fantastic breakfast can t fault in any way room lovely and modern ,1
 the hotel has the worst attitude customer service i have ever experienced and totally did not meet or understand my requirements,0
 rooms where old and dated carpets stained and the beds were terrible bad mattresses and every time you moved from side to side the box spring made a noise very old furniture needs remodeling ,0
 great friendly staff clean rooms and facilities,1
 i appreciate that london rooms are small but this place takes it to the extreme the sole lift in the place fits no more than 3 people and is extremely slow ridiculous that if you want a cappuccino during your complimentary breakfast that you need to pay extra ,0
 the staff were lovely and very helpful the location was perfect and the room was immaculate i loved the living and kitchen areas my children were also made to feel very welcome with a goody bag on arrival ,1
 everything the service is horrible room service is more than horrible they even don t have a breakfast menu when i called to order and i ordered 3 times not once they say call after 10 minutes and when i call to bring something like ice or ketchup they usually answer me like ok on the way and no one show up they don t clean the room they don t change the bedsheets they only fix the bed my stay was the worst ever i don t recommend at all btw it was written like garden view it wasn t a garden and when i asked to change my room view to the other side they asked me to pay 90 euro ,0
 i picked this as a stop over for the heathrow express as reasonably close to paddington and the underground quiet and comfortable and much better ambiance and value than the converted properties in bloomsbury around the bm where i stayed before good choice lots of wonderful eateries nearby ,1
 great location good breakfast buffet very friendly and helpful staff big and comfortable room good street noise insulation ,1
 i stayed in the hotel for 8 nights the lobby is deceptively attractive once you head up in the lifts it all deteriorates the costs were relatively high for the size and quality of the room the room is old and quite crummy carpets are dirty etc my booking com booking did not come through to the property so i arrived and there was no reservation on hand and no room available at 5pm i couldn t wait long and therefore had to access my bag in the hotel s toilet which was not a comfortable welcome then the hotel put two holds on my credit card for the full amount i alerted them to this fact but this was not immediately reversed possibly the delay is not their fault but this mistake did mean difficulty with access to money i fell in the bathroom shower due to inadequate old facilities the shower is a bath conversion and had a small no slip mat it is very slippery and no warning there is no anti slip on the floor of the bathroom and it s very easy to fall the bathrooms were dirty let s just say the stuff that should have been in the toilet was on and around the toilet on arrival ,0
 i found the staff super friendly and helpful front desk restaurant door men room staff dining room and kitchen staff they all took the trouble to talk and help that s impressive i love the history of the building it has retained its wonderful victorian heritage don t change that i loved the dragon on the 2nd floor staircase so cool the wifi in my room and all around the hotel worked well it was located very close to the tube station ,1
 comfy bed,1
 the staff were so friendly helpful,1
 welcoming kindness cleaness,1
 with out doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in cramped room over filled with tatty furniture bed on castors on a badly fitted wood floor kept moving automatic bathroom light kept switching off whilst i was in the shower no tea or coffee making facility bar of soap in the bathroom and there is more,0
 we had to pay a deposit of 50 for just in case we loose the key although i ve stayed in central and big hotels in london i ve never heard such a policy i think the hotel in general doesn t justify its value for money ,0
 the room was on the 33rd floor there was renovations going on which i was not told about when booking the noise levels were unbearable and could not rest during the day the bathroom had a constant running water sound and the aircon could not adjust the hotel did offer to move me to another room on the second floor but it had no view and it was not a smoking room that was not what i paid for ,0
 great location and lovely breakfast selection lovely clean room with large comfortable bed nice and quiet and amazing shower and bath ,1
 facilities is very poor,0
 it s was a beautiful place amazing architecture and a room upgrade ,1
 staff who choose not to speak to me make eye contact and ignore me however when my partner joined me to answer his questions immediately treatment to women is outrageous for london and 2015 not the standard of service you d expect from a high end chain very disappoint and offended won t be staying in a marriott anywhere in the world again ,0
 cleanliness toilet badly stained hairs etc etc,0
 extremely friendly staff very comfortable facilities many amenities in a very desirable area of london excellent breakfast,1
 everything,0
 good hotel with friendly staff close to station and a short walk to hyde park ,1
 great room very comfortable bed nice and quiet fantastic decor and amazing staircases the location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour the immediate area is fantastic great park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available near by brewery that do tours not heineken and great beer good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,1
 staff were amazing couldn t help you enough it s a shame we were not pre warned of extensive renovation work to the hotel upon booking though enjoy a lovely breakfast in the bar upon request the breakfast room was very busy and noisy as the main restaurant was closed for building works rooms needing a bit of tlc as older but beds were extremely comfy bathroom was compact but very nice bath and facilities and our club room was huge i recommend here for a short stay ,1
 great size very luxurious room,1
 friendly staff peaceful hotel ,1
 lovely staff always a warm welcome really nice hotel in london ,1
 the design and ambience of the hotel was great,1
 staff was not welcoming informed upon check in wi fi is 30 min low speed free 5 euros high speed for 30 min and 8 euros for 1 hour this is not only false advertising but absolute theft hotel is a day use hotel ,0
 what a 4 star should be,1
 room wasn t ready upon arrival charged 40 pounds more per nights to change the room to two double beds room was unclean recption security staff was very rude room was too small bed wasn t comfortable wi fi has poor signal and low speed ,0
 desperatly in need of a complete refurb carpet in room was disgusting light features not working or hanging off the wall bathroom with mold breakfast average,0
 location for olympia was brilliant,1
 i liked the location it was in a nice quiet area yet central and close to the stations so getting around was easy the room was nice and cosy ,1
 very nice hotel great rooms,1
 very comfortable beds well lit room bathroom compact but worked well the staff were all polite and helpful good gardens and quiet location,1
 while all the hotels in the world offer a cradle service this hotel force to pay for another bed for the baby when a baby cant sleep in a bed for security reasons we had to change the booked room at last time with no other possibility paying more money totally disgraceful feeling of fraud,0
 the booking rules were very stringent no flexibility at all ,0
 i loved the hotels history and its sumptuously embellished original features especially the theatre bar where i met my three guests who had also booked suites with you for champagne to celebrate my birthday and your amazing staircase it was good value for money and its location was central close to the tube station and perfect for exploring kensington gardens and palace and the royal albert hall the staff were very friendly and accommodating and had left me chocolates and a fruit basket for my birthday and did not make a charge for breakfast ,1
 price too hight some part of the year,0
 poor room poor location room was not clean,0
 worst arrival and departure experience worst housekeeping on cleanliness and standards on amenities bad air conditioning faulty power plugs and rude employees,0
 we booked for 3 nyts on the first night we had the shower leaking and flooded out the whole bathroom the plumber was called and took a while fixing the shower which made us very late going out then the cleaner come after 20minutues of waiting around once we got back the toilet then over flooded which at this time it was very late and we wanted to sleep we spoke to reception and the gentleman told us he was going have to move us rooms we then had to pack all of our stuff and move out that room around 3am in the morning which caused alot of distress when we just wanted to relax the room was smaller than the one we already had,0
 very smart modern clean bar area was impressive,1
 strategic position great staff,1
 location the staff were very helpful and the room and hotel lived up to the rating breakfast was vey good value ,1
 room was big enough bed comfortable,1
 dated interior shabby room no quilts on beds throw back to the 70 s,0
 see above,0
 first experience entering the room and the pipe of shower was leaking spraying water all over the bathroom when i called reception i got the answer that there is nothing to be done at this point cause is saturday night breakfast very limited and for sure not what i paid according to the advertisement ,0
 staff is not very freindly rooms are not cleaned well we have to ask for water everyday and sometimes they say it is finished rooms are very small we booked 1 room connected and they said they don t have this type of rooms and this is booking com mistake and they can t resolve it it ended up family was separated and disappointed,0
 hotel was absolutely beautiful comfy bed and very pleased to have a bath in room service was fantastic location was amazing just near kensington palace and tube station 2 minutes away very happy with location and service will certainly book again luxury at the end of our trip before heading home ,1
 fascinating history of this place opulent hall and bar perfect for small business meetings,1
 my room was located in a dungeon like setting in the underground level of the external rear of the building within a group of independent little blocks a permanent and loud noise from some conditioned air machine i supposed ruined my sleep it felt like i was on a cruise on top of that the room had wide windows and apart the feeling of lack of privacy the curtains were not sufficient to retain artificial light to come in at night overall i did not feel comfortable the wi fi signal was really bad absent in my morlock room breakfast was served in a different building across the square but once there no signs lead the way ,0
 a 2 3 star hotel charging 5 prices our room was shabby as was the breakfast area female receptionist sneering and rude never again ,0
 excellent breakfast and evening meal,1
 very children focussed welcome pack on arrival vouchers for icecream and drinks at bar ,1
 room was hot as the aircon didn t work very well the room was still hot and not properly ventilated even turned to the lowest 16c while london was 25c it was annoying for experiencing on and off power for tv water kettle and plug the mattress was falling on edges meaning that it should be replaced after more than 5 8 year usage the design of the washroom was poor with the glass halfly covered the bathing area so water can easily split to the floor causing possible fall check out staff was very rude and gave me a lesson to me don t be rude but there were 2 staff there one was ignorant and was reading his own document while the rude on was insisting on answering the previous guest on direction to tube what an unforgettable experience for a big hotel chain with bad mannered staff it put a disastrous reputational damage to the whole hotel chain lancaster tube station is closed meaning the hotel prime location is no longer the case i would not recommend this hotel to anyone and would personally never use this hotel chain it is disappointing ,0
 wery good hotel as location clean servise and it is value for the money i always recommended,1
 i disliked the second bed isn t bedroom two bed the second bed was for the kids and we don t have two kit for the bathroom ,0
 1 appalling experience and 2 bad experiences am reporting this hotel to booking com ,0
 the vfm was poor room was small and the air con broken hottest night of the year and they didn t even discuss with us when we checked in,0
 the level of hygiene was not good at all,0
 we had a room with an interconnecting door could listen to every word the girls next door were saying we asked to change room so at 11pm we had to transfer 6 luggages and a wedding dress honeymooners by the way to another room downstairs which had disability access we do appreciate we were offered another room however on switching on the light in the bathroom a noisy pump turned on which would not stop we reported it to maintenance nothing was done we were never offered any type of re imbursement for this incovenience ,0
 1 hotel mess up my stay from 23 24 dec as room was not cleaned until 5 pm we had to wait despite telling them at 1 pm room not ready but when we came back at 4 pm room still not cleaned we complained and the f o mgr meet us apologize and told us will inform us when room is ready but nobody did we went up on our own to the room and found it redy at 5 pm but nobody bothered to call us toi check until we checked out on 24 dec ,0
 the most terrible staff the doorman was incredibly racist towards us,0
 i paid for a room with a view as it was my fianc birthday and didn t get on we were looking out to rubbish bins the first room we went into had dirty sheets and blood on the pillow ,0
 the staff were very helpful and polite ,1
 no free wifi uncomfortable bed outdated decor unfriendly staff,0
 i ve talked to several people ola gabrielle salem about how dissatisfied and was never asked to be put in another room nor did they compensate me for the extreme discomfort i was in then i was told veronique delattre was going to be in contact and that was 4 days ago my daughter had a room ella 18 4 21 4 and the air cooling system was broke and we called 2 times and finally they brought her a fan never was she asked to be put in another room or anything and our room air cooling system worked perfect however in our room there was a really bad smell coming out of the pipes that causes my fianc to buy several times and i mentioned downstairs and nobody ever sent anyone up or asked to put us in another room because my daughter s room didn t smell like that every time we had breakfast something was wrong and they had to bring something else up on the last day we ordered an express brekfast and the lady on the phone said she would have a grilled ham and cheese with a coffee when i go downstairs to pick it up gabrielle said they don t make grilled ham and cheese and the kitchen was closed and they don t make coffee now i stay in hotels every single week and i ve never heard in the history of staying anywhere that our kitchen is closed and we can t make you coffee if that was the case i would never tell a paying customer that we can t make a cup of coffee for you even if the kitchen was closed but what made matters worse was that they lady took our order down and it has 2 cups of coffee my point is that the staff taking the order could have told us paying customer that which would not have made it right but at least it would have made us aware in the end we didn t eat the sandwich and the banana looked like they were both open and we didn t eat those finally salem in the end after much complaining and understanding where i was coming from he made us a coffee ,0
 everything especially the location,1
 good location comfortable bed modern room,1
 the rooms were too dark and warm after shaving i got on a plane and realized i missed half my face the bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet the bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room it was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room the walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories one should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast the staff were from anywhere else but britain which did not help make our british experience any better ,0
 n,0
 the fact we ordered room service and they made me come down pay for it at 1 o clock in the morning yad think the morning would of done for 9 after paying 400 for room do they think i m goin do a runner over 9 quid but i ll get the last laugh our rugby team is going over in couple of months and we won t be staying here,0
 perfect for a concert at the hammersmith apollo hotel is huge but quiet no external noise breakfast was good although as its a buffet the food is generally lukewarm staff are very friendly helpful would definitely stay here again if in the area again ,1
 location excellent tube is close by so travel is easy breakfast excellent staff friendly rooms spotless bed was so soft and comfy,1
 club room is very shabby and grubby and is not fit for purpose the breakfast offering was very poor and inadequately stocked it is not worth the extra money and if anything is very inferior to the breakfast offering on the b b option ,0
 the location,1
 excellent location with friendly and helpful staff the consierge was very helpful when i asked for a route on the tube ,1
 great location right near 2 major underground lines rooms were small but manageable,1
 very friendly staff except for the initial experience described above vaides the concierge was especially helpful ,1
 the condition of the hotel fell far far below four star class and i m amazed they ve retained this rating if they have the corridors were tired with door frames marked by years of trollies banging into them the room was blessed with a noisy antiquated air conditioner dirty wall a carpet with scorch marks from an iron and a small double with an old mattress not worth the money even in such a good location ,0
 on arrival i was upgraded to the penthouse apartment what a beautiful view the room was so spacious and the staff were friendly will definitely stay again the future ,1
 spa and pool area is very nice even though it is not included in hotel price and room was very clean bed was also comfy overall a very pleasant stay ,1
 inflexible reservation system,0
 location,1
 everything was very nice and the staff was real helpful thanks to all,1
 the staff were excellent the bloody mary s in the bar were perfect and the location was ideal ,1
 poor location with access to very little entertainment such as restaurants other than in hotel no bar in the hotel and lack of coffee shops very small room so photos on website are deceptive tv didn t work properly but some came to fix it ,0
 given the wrong room lied to by staff on numerous occasions rude staff grilled me during checkout about the minibar saying that they could see i had opened it and must of had something which i didn t i only looked poorly managed hotel very little communication when problems occur informed i had a family room it was a standard double without 2 beds or a sofa bed to pull out i was told a sofa would be brought up which wasn t and when the manager came up to resolve the issue he told me the room was a family room and when i showed him the difference between the 2 rooms on trip advisor pictures he apologized and gave me 15 to spend at the bar just terrible during the conversation with manager my friend heard 2 members of staff down the hall say can t we just give them a family room to which the other responded with nah we re fully booked that s why we had to give them a different room overall i paid for a lesser room was offered no refund or upgrade i had to review pictures online to prove them wrong and in the end i was only given money to spend at the bar so i had to share a double bed with my friend and in the end was offered no apology and was grilled during checkout about the minibar look elsewhere if possible ,0
 the bed was very comfortable ,1
 the hotel is tired and outdated in terms of decor staff although efficient showed very little interest in my complaint of a bad nights sleep for my two year old son as we were put in a room right next to a housekeeping closet and entry and exit to this room happened until late into the evening the room itself felt rather dirty the carpet should be replaced or burnt it was filthy the bathrooms fittings were very old there was rust a cracked basin pock marked bath and the entire room felt generally unclean and certainly unpolished very disappointing stay it seems the hotel relies on regular patronage from the olympias exhibition centre as well as numerous airline staff and as they are still getting bookings they have made no effort to update the rooms or hotel decor in anyway ,0
 the staff were all very friendly and helpful they dealt with queries well and were attentive ,1
 good breakfast but 25euro per head a little expensive ,1
 no water in the morning not air conditioning have to sleep with windows open,0
 from the website it showed that we were getting a 48 reduction and that the room was originally chf 468 and the reduced price was chf 139 however the room was quite a dissappointment and hard to imagine that it would originally cost chf 468 as the size of the room and even quality does not match the price at all we thought we were getting a good offer but it didn t seem like it as i am positive the room we stayed in does not cost chf 468 per day i am even wondering if this is a methodology used by the hotel to get customers to book the hotel overall i did not get what i expect and would not stay there again ,0
 ambience staff welcoming excellent buffet breakfast,1
 lovely staff lovely hotel no hassle at all ,1
 everything about the place ,0
 the hotel was lush beds were extremely comfy very clean too staff were great always willing to help ,1
 extremely polite warm staff we have stayed before but they made us feel like regulars ,1
 eggs were nice the beds also were comfortable,1
 a total disgrace the way we were treated,0
 everything,1
 this is a gorgeous setting and very well located i will stay here again on my next trip to paris it was like a dream ,1
 noisy room due to most probably plumbing issues we knew every time the neighbour in the next room visited his her bathroom our bathroom extremely small uncomfortable for two people ,0
 location,1
 thermostat in room was broken had hotel porter come to the room at 2am to unbolt the window ,0
 efficient friendly clean,1
 rooms are dated nothing special staff not welcoming,0
 the room was beautiful and staff were extremely helpful ,1
 everything from the price to the state of the room we had a free upgrade to a superior king the room was small and dirty with mould in the bathroom this hotel calls itself 5 star but does not deliver very poor standards,0
 this is the right hotel for you if you are prepared to 1 have neither a chair nor a table in your room 2 have no hanger for your towels 3 use a breakfast room with an open kitchen that makes you smell like sausage and bacon for hours 4 have a metal grilled window if you stay in a lower ground room with no escape should there be a fire in the hallway of stairway 5 not be able to open a window 6 not have ventilation in the windowless bathroom 7 not have anyone guard your baggage after check out they just tell you to leave it next to the reception desk without any need to identify yourself when you come to pick it up later 8 carry your baggage to the third floor no elevator there was no tv remote control in my room and the safe didn t work fire doors were always left open even though a sign told you to keep them shut my advice look for another hotel ,0
 staff great and helpful room good excellent all round,1
 quiet friendly staff cleanliness garden very convenient for underground,1
 very modern and clean and lovely staff,1
 noisy dirty very expensive,0
 concierge service reception staff good clean and tidy,1
 the room was hot because of the sun they could have closed the curtains or turned on the air conditioning it smelled of cigarettes and the carpet was filthy we asked for another room and they proposed a room at the back with a small double bed instead of the twin room we had booked so we refused the lever of the bath and shower mixer was missing so we had to pull on the bolt in the common sitting room the upholstery of the sofas was torn and worn out the carpet was being held together with tape this is not a 4 star hotel booking com has mislead us seriously ,0
 the bed was uncomfortable the tv was tucked in the corner of the room front desk staff was unpleasant ,0
 more helpul with the languages ,0
 the room was too tiny small after stored two baggages it was easily to hit your knee and no space to sit although booked double room two months ago staff could not well reserve room for you they arranged me to studio room for one night after complaint they shifted us to double room the studio room had an unpleasant smell all night that you could not fall asleep ,0
 chaos at check in room not ready got back bag had not been taken to room no to remote room so small even i was off edge of bed im only just over 5ft couldn t move air conditioning didn t work this was meant to be a delux double,0
 good location in earls court quiet and comfortable ,1
 the location was great lobby area and bar very nice and staff very helpful ,1
 the hotel location is not as mention on the booking and the room also not as mention in the booking com the housekeeping peoples came lots of time in the room without permission without knock ,0
 gd portion sizes,1
 staff were friendly and helpful liked the iphone for use in the room ,1
 there were no electricity plugs window blackout was not there toilet seat need to be fixed the water was not flowing proprly,0
 after a booking reservation glitch the hotel made me pay for a night when they had over a week to rebook the room bad customer relations and very greedy ,0
 everything was perfect from the staff to the hotel it was all brilliant can t wait to stay again ,1
 great and quiet rooms,1
 excellent service politeness,1
 found a dirty pillow case and then after house keeping cleaned the room it was still there my shower was also broken and when i told them nothing happened the food was ok at best depending on what you order i had a pizza and it was ok but the penne with tomato sauce wasn t good at all it s also too expensive for what you get,0
 almost everything location staff breakfast the room the bathroom ,1
 we were given an upgraded room due to problems with our original room and subsequent late check it the room was stunning the staff are so friendly and welcoming especially graham the doorman whom we laughed with a genuine gentleman the walkway to the arena is a great bonus too ,1
 durty housekeeping not made noisy old and very bad isolation of the room so we hear every single thing from the room aside,0
 wonderful bedrooms wonderful facilities great views of the thames and within walking distance of the o2 couldn t have asked for more ,1
 excellent location next to kensington gardens hyde park 50m ,1
 arrongant personnel at concierge that do not know to treat guests,0
 delicious healthy breakfast,1
 parking is really poor 1 2 mile away the door to the bathroom could not close and stayed open quite embarrassing really room was hideously small could not even walk around the bed the noise from the corridor is horrendous it s like the people are in your room ,0
 the bathroom terrible shower and so old fashioned the bed hard and uncomfortable and a very small double general drab bedroom and corridors dungeon to eat breakfast,0
 every thing,1
 great location amazing features inside,1
 the elevator was out of order for 5 days that we know of walking the stairs with a bad knee was not fun ,0
 room s were vile took 3 rooms to get us a semi decent one staff are rude 1 room was infested with moths and carpet was eaten by them was more like a 1 2 star hotel not value for money ,0
 such helpful and friendly staff the breakfast was simply the best we have ever experienced at a hotel we will definitely return ,1
 the upgrade to the penthouse suite,1
 i was staying at this hotel 24 28 5 2017 and became badly bitten by vermin during my stay there i ve contacted my physician directly the same day i left the hotel and he confirmed it i ve sent the message with the pictures with the marks at my body to the hotel and the person who answered me wrote that it was somewhere else i became bitten but not at this hotel nonsense as i ve got marks already the same day as i left the hotel and the pictures are dated i answered with the e mail twice where i asked for the contact details to the owners but still haven t got any answer being a 4 property it is not acceptable in general the hotel has old furnitures textiles and carpets in the rooms building and hotel s cleaning crevice is not the best one as for example my room remained unclean last day i was staying at the hotel and obviously vermin and very poor customer care ,0
 we had a junior suite which had a luggage room in it which was excellent the bed was comfortable and the room was neat and clean ,1
 very poor experience on check in rooms were ridiculously small overall customer service was lacking ,0
 doorman was very helpful obtaining a taxi for a early morning flight helped with our luggage and opening the taxi doors for myself and my travel buddy ,1
 everything apart from the location dirty rooms dirty carpets very very over priced,0
 no air conditioner in the room with 30 degrees just a fan really small space not acceptable we left the hotel after the first night paying for two nights ,0
 the room was spacious and tastefully furnished we also really liked the bathroom ,1
 receptionist was more interested in a taxi drivers problems and it took 15 minutes to book in ,0
 room was very modern spacious bed extremely comfortable shower brilliant staff very helpful,1
 my room was very noise due something like a service room behind it i think with ac motor making noise all night long the room was super hot even if the thermostat was set to 19 the breakfast it s a joke for 17 the lobby has to be cleaned early in the morning not when it s full of clients at 8 30 ,0
 the worst attitude towards me by the reception staff i have ever experienced in my life extremely rude and unhelpful unfortunately i dont know the names the worst breakfast i have ever eaten extremely old and small rooms it is an overall problem of paris but not in 4 star hotel in the night the whole lightening stopped working in the room had to call for technical guy in the bathroom the door of the shower was broken and barely closing overall very bad impression from the hotel which looks so representative outside will never recommend it to somebody extremely dissapointed ,0
 the property is old i mean old old needs to be rebuilt the room size was small and the bathroom had no business being called a bath room i mean one had to hop over the bidet to reach the shower no hooks hangers for used towels either the bed was below normal size i feared rolling over to the floor in my sleep ,0
 beautiful building very close to tube station,1
 the room is completely outdated way too expensive ,0
 staff,1
 staff service bathroom shower,0
 great location great view comfortable bed nice room great balcony,1
 this place was completely outdated they charge you for every little thing enterance to they gym a towel at the gym internet etc ,0
 very expensive majority of staff didn t speak english which we suffered during our stay only one elevator was working so we took much time to go up down breakfast options is very limited and not suitable for muslims restaurants is very small so sometimes we have to wait to get in room is very small and there is no wardrobe really was not convenient stay at all,0
 very good location restaurants and supermarkets around and the clineanliness of the hotel ,1
 there is no drinking water in bed room totally not expected from a brand like holiday inn coffee and tea maker in room but no water ,0
 bed was ok,1
 breakfast was excellent as was everything else about the hotel location couldn t have been better ,1
 it got very cold in our rooms at night and the heater in our room never worked despite asking for help no member of staff came along to assist us we stayed for a period of two nights and 3 days our shower only had hot water to bathe with on the first day and it was ice cold for the next two no help was provided once again you would expect better customer service than this from a hilton brand ,0
 nice location friendly staff,1
 room size of bed,0
 everything ,1
 bed was very uncomfortable you could feel the springs in the thin mattress and also the divan was like a piece of board waitress at breakfast could have served with a smile seemed like every thing was too much trouble,0
 hotel dirty minibar empty breakfast too expensive too many trainees at check in check out ,0
 the room location beautiful lounges bar ,1
 hotel is un secure everybody can walk all parts of hotel and we had stuff stolen from our room also part of staff has no language skills and is arrogant if you do not speak french fluently,0
 the room was extremely clean bed and pillows were very comfortable and the room was quiet ,1
 the hotel is amazing beautiful interior we weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof our room was fantastic the only thing i should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc the room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush ,1
 rubbish breakfast and served with a grunt ,0
 great location great hotel exactly why im an ihg gold member great concierge check in and luggage staff,1
 the lobby was nice but the rooms were terrible floors were not vaccummed the shower leaked there was a stench in the room i wanted to vomit it was disgusting ,0
 this is not a 4 star hotel our room was old and dirty the walls had mold the carpet had big stains the urinal is was black inside and had toilet paper inside when we first got into the room and all furniture was very cratched up not even remotely worth the money spent ,0
 the concierge services and the staff generally are extremely helpful and professional they were able to get us best seats it s a great place to bring teenagers and the viewnof the bridge from the room is magical ,1
 the noise from above our room we had the lobby above us ,0
 the whole experience from check in to check out was a disaster we arrived on out business trip to be greeted by construction at the reception area there was no one at the desk to check us in we needed to find one of the cleaning staff after 15 mins to alert reception that customers were had arrived once the receptionist arrived he was extremely rude we were told that the dining room was closed and breakfast would be delivered to the room the next day not a major issue there we thought when we mentioned that we were surprised by the level of construction and the effect this had on the overall quality of the hotel experience we were met with an unbelievable answer he informed us that because we had booked through booking com he mentioned it was our prerogative to inform booking com of the construction and not the hotels this is ridiculous we were told to come back later as he could not check us in at 13 00 so grudgingly we left our bags and went to work the rooms were basic enough the morning s breakfast did not arrive we checked out at 8am and three other guests were complaining that breakfast had not arrived in their room either the same arrogant attitude was present from a different member of staff all in all this was a terrible stay from start to finish we were there for only one night but i would advise everyone to seek alternative arrangements in the kensington area best western is a recognised name in the uk hospitality industry this is one of the worst experiences i have had in many years of business travel staff 0 10 experience 0 10 value for money at 198 per room 0 10 do not stay here ,0
 the room was very small considering it was meant to me s deluxe room bathroom was too small ,0
 the staff were barely able to grasp english and had poor customer service attitudes at 10 30pm our table were advised that we had to eat up as they needed to clear away to prepare for breakfast having just arrived from italy where the serving staff could not have been more accommodating helpful and friendly the attitudes exhibited by the grosvenor staff was poor and unwelcoming an example the concierge staff looked on as our party struggled up the entrance stairs and through the doors both on arrival and exit no offer of assistance was made nor was any offer to take our luggage up to our rooms for a hotel aspiring to be 4 5 stars the service was poor and the food and drinks over priced this is a large hotel and the breakfast self serving area is very small the lack of attentiveness by waiting staff continued to breakfast time where consistently we had to go and ask for coffee refills ,0
 good range of foods and drinks for the breakfast location is just next to earl s court station compact but clean equipment fully provided room friendly staffs,1
 big open windows that were really pleasant ,1
 the staff were lovely i wasn t well on arrival and got there 3 hours before check in yet the sorted a room out for me immediately fantastic,1
 the hotel location is great it is a walking distance to london eye westiminster bridge parliament square westminster abbey buckingham palace and many more the staffs are great and very responsive to request ,1
 the hotel was very clean breakfast and tea were great service was great at the meals as well common areas were beautiful each room had its own temperature control including ac location was great ,1
 good facilities attentive staff good location ,1
 great room and food friendly staff ,1
 pictures of this hotel in booking com looks better than in reality ,0
 staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in the cafe is very cool will be back,1
 construction noise elevator inoperable,0
 beautiful hotel nice room and excelelnt facilities for breakbast and dining ,1
 they lied outright and by doing so made us all sign up to the ihg rubbish they told us that this will give us cheaper rates and late check outs as well as priority bookings but no such thing i ve had this ihg for a few months and it has been the biggest nightmare and a front for the staff at both holiday inn and staybridge suites to embarrass us as if we didn t graduate from university and wouldn t understand their poor unfounded claims for why we aren t entitled to the very elements we were promised by becoming a member the price via ihg is always extortionate compared to booking com and this will only give you some points of which you need 10 more extortionate stays before you may qualify for a free night via booking com you would have managed to save enough money to have got 3 4 extra nights for free after paying for 10 via money saved ,0
 querky bar area easy access to under ground and central london ,1
 the building exterior was very impressive the interior was stunning loved the history of the interior the bar was very comfortable and the restaurant for breakfast was excellent our room was quite small but had everything needed including a comfortable bed,1
 the bath after a long day shopping,1
 the fact there was no hot water in the room and the staff didn t seem to think that was a problem,0
 we booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly they moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was 2 single beds pushed together they gave us the 60 it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there they then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine for the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again ,0
 beds were comfortable room clean did the job ideal for business travel right next to hyde park so a real bonus ,1
 room was dirty hairs on the bed dirty toilet seat black and cobwebs on the walls classic double room had no more than 5inches either side of the bed and about 1 sq n of floor space i rang to complain but reception did not answer when i went down she was busy chatting to her friend in the lounge do not stay in room 11 unless you have very low expectations we loved paris and everything else about the city ,0
 i was served by elisa on front desk and she was amazing and very friendly i wanted a late checkout 2pm and they were happy to do that with no extra cost the hotel room was clean and the room size was a reasonable size would definitely stay here again ,1
 did not like the bedroom although bed was comfortable was expecting a 4 star or better but the bedroom and hallways gave it a 3 rating staff at the welcome desk did not smile at all ,0
 high level of service and comfort throughout the hotel,1
 good location staff friendly good wifi,1
 internet was not operating at all the breakfast was terrible,0
 same as above,0
 staff were lovely,1
 furniture very old and mostly broken also the rooms are small the window is broken the room is very dirty and the towels need to be changed,0
 the check in and check out procedures were smooth it was really clean in a super great and safe district the room was spacious for our needs the location was pretty central through which you can reach anywhere once you are familiar with the directions ,1
 bad food housekeeping knocking on the door every morning several times very poor room service,0
 happy with pur stay,1
 room not made up 6night stay water pressure bad toilet would not flush door to bathroom jammed air con did not function cigarette butts all over entrance ,0
 dated rooms small and very tired the bed was so uncomfortable it ruined our weekend ,0
 my sister and i bought our parents a trip to london for christmas and we all went in the end of march we stayed at grand royal hyde park for 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it the staff was lovely and always very helpful the breakfast buffet was amazing with heaps of different things to chose from and the dining area had such nice old london interior which is what we wanted for our stay the rooms had a more modern feel interior and the rooms were a bit small but since you re always out and about while being in london anyways it didn t bother us at all as long as you have a roof over your head and a bed to sleep in we re a ok the hotel is basically across the street from hyde park and only 2 min walk to queens way underground which easy takes you where ever you want around london very centred perfect spot if you want to live close to basically everything so yeah definitely a place we would all return to a really nice hotel for such a decent price which is hard to find so centred in london in general awesome staff and service great breakfast and a really nice bar downstairs by the lobby for afternoon drinks before heading out for the evening will definitely return ,1
 check in under staffed tv didn t work furniture out of place and from the 70 s poor lighting bed awful bathroom generally poor shower a joke i could go on,0
 it s a really good hotel in the city extremely comfortable and quiet considering the location this was my second time staying and i d have no hesitation returning in future ,1
 the spacious room,1
 great location,1

 the room was extremely small it would have been acceptable as a single room but not as a double room the bed was extremely small and it was attached to the wall on one side and a small passage on the other side i am not sure how it can be called a double room ,0
 great location clean and comfortable ,1
 excellent service and nice ambience,1

 the room service cleaning etc was good the hotel was clean bar staff good drinks expensive whiskey and coke and barcardi and coke was 15 70 well it is london i suppose reception staff good ,1
 the room was disgusting extremely tatty and small and stuffy there were renovations going on and we were told there would be a little noise between 10 and 6 it was like living on a building site the drilling started around 9 whilst we were still in bed and we couldn t get out the room quick enough to escape the racket the breakfast was very average not much choice which i would of expected from a good hotel like the hyatt the panoramic bar had fantastic views and we had a lovely drink pre dinner however when we returned later it was a different experience the waiters were unfriendly and we were made to queue to go in to be seated whist in the queue the doorman let his mates through the cocktail was a short measure and tasted completely different we complained and the waiter was very snooty this hotel is obviously experiencing great problems ,0
 the room was not the same as on the site the room is very very small at the floor 8 you hit the wall the room smelt strongly a tabacco air conditioner dripped all night,0
 excellent location nice rooms helpful staff,1
 my friend dropped some nail polish on their carpet they told us to get it professionally cleaned which we paid an outside firm 55 pounds to come and do the stain faded to barely anything to match all the other stains from previous guests without my authorization or agreement they charged my card with 1171 pounds for what they call damages i was appalled and i am disputing this payment with my cc company the manager did not know nor share the terms and conditions and handled it rudely and without any customer handling competence stay here if you want to get ripped off never again ,0
 comfortable room bed good tv good,1
 well kept clean and cheerful well trained staff with great attitude ,1
 the worst hotel i ve ever stayed in i would never stay there again and would never recommend it the people in charge are very very rude the staff are angry very noisy you can hear everything from your bed even when people are calling the lift terrible was a wast of money i ve stayed in 4 star hotels that were amazing in paris ,0

 our room double booked wouldn t accept sterling from northern ireland over charged on my card sheets were dirty and had to be changed imcompetence of staff,0
 this hotel was great value for money only a few tram stops away from the city centre it was close enough for all the attractions of amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood the zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop very accessible the room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep i ve ever had i would highly recommend this hotel ,1

 the location was good for what we were there for ,1
 most uncomfortable bed ever,0
 there was no heat in the room which was absurd given the 600 night cost there was mold in the bathroom the custom airport pickup was 1 hour late the room size was perfect if you were 3 feet tall ,0
 personel sometimes my colleague and me were treated like guests and sometime we were treated like trash especially on friday the 18th at check out time the ladies at the desk were unable to hide their contempt for us and other guests they also tried to get me to pay a bill that was not mine when i could finally see the bill after many requests almost begging it proved the fact not to be mine there was no apology only a disdainful look my colleague tried to print his boarding pass at the desk in vain only when a friendly italian colleague from the desk employees went to interfere we finally got the print ,0
 our room was first floor and the view from our window was completely covered by the air conditioning units of the hotel we expected a much nicer outlook from our room especially as it cost us over 200 a night when we asked for another room we were told there was nothing available so rather than waste more time trying to explain to another foreign receptionist we left the hotel and went out in london to enjoy ourselves ,0
 the staff are not professionally trained as a staff opened my room without knocking in the very early morning the facility looks new however the door in my room was too rusted to open so i was locked and could not open the door inside the room fortunately got help from the staff in the end the towels are not clean as they were badly stained not sure if they changed it from previous occupants the aircon produced hot air not cold and it was noisy all night through probably the worst experience i ve ever had stay away from this hotel ,0
 the rooms are extremely small the room i had was smaller than a dorm room the width of my room was 6 feet i could literally touch both walls at the same time ,0
 too small a room no coffee until 9 00 am had to pay twice as i changed credit card 2weeks for refund ,0

 inside the hotel could do with complete redecorateing and new furniture ,0
 i didn t have an opportunity to sample this hotel as they had a mix up as they put it and sent us to another hotel the staff there were rude as they spoke in a foreign language whilst resolving the issue so i didn t know what was going on,0
 room very small and in an annexe opposite hotel thin walls therefore noisy there was a delivery at 6 30 am which was also loud no double glazing so again noisy drinks in small bar limited to small expensive bottles management said not their fault i would not return was well overpriced for quality of room ,0
 the location was excellent for travelling by the underground the staff were very helpful and accommodating to our requests ,1
 very welcoming and helpful staff which is so important ,1
 too far off the beaten track too much building work going on rooms small and bathroom even smaller,0
 we ve booked a superior room but the room we stayed is a classic room for sure there were just the room facilities of a classic room and the room was soooooo small than it s written they insist on that it was a superior room but it was not we ve checked from booking com and hotel s website too superior and classic rooms must have been quite different that s why we ve paid an extra 40 euros but we regret our stay at this hotel we d be better to stay at the hotel that was also 4 and with higher rating and 100 euros cheaper ,0
 horrible wifi given by daily tickets that feels like food rations to the point of absute frustrarion hidden reception forced service bad breakfast,0
 very poor service and quality ,0
 staff extremely helpful and friendly room upgrade on arrival free of charge to a penthouse suite fantastic for us as was our first time away just the two of us in 3 years 2 min walk from waterloo station,1

 location was excellent for paddington station great design of bedroom nice staff,1
 the bathroom was not a 4 star hotel bathroom not clean not brand new etc ,0
 loved everything free rubber duck ,1
 a great location perfect for access to paddington and the heathrow express as well as an easy walk to the west end shops the room was small and wardrobe space very limited it was however perfect for a short stay and it was clean the staff were also friendly and helpful ,1
 1 separated toilet from shower 2 shower area so dirty and have musty 3 no have hot water just bit warm 4 tap water smelly as it have similar to sewerage smell 5 toilet are no have trash,0
 we stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel we loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom we were 3 adults and one toddler in this suite breakfast was great as well and the location right next to hyde park and kensington gardens is perfect for kids mommies can go shopping on the westbourne grove ,1
 very bad experience very small room army eh staffs were very rude,0
 good location with convenient access to subway station quite environment and rooms with reasonnable size for paris very clean and confortable ,1
 staff room facilities,0

 reception staff could not have been more helpful pleasant and accommodating ,1
 utter waste of money you book something and they give you a random room no wi fi no parking ,0
 v hot night no air con stuffy room we were told breakfast till 10 30 we arrived down 9 50 and taken to the idian restaurant in hotel because breakfast room was full in there 10 mins and staff started to clear breakfast away we were then told breakfast finishes at 10 there what we did eat was v poor quality complained at checkout asked to see manger and told he would contact me later by phone heard nothing ,0
 the taps in the bathroom were falling apart the bath mat was disgusting overall the executive suite needed updating and decorating in the evening we sat in one of the bars no music and very little atmosphere ,0
 dirt dirt dirt i have never been to such a dirty hotel that is suppose to be 4 or 5 stars dirty carpets stains on pilows bedding its was ubelivable like a castle full of dirt and dust i gave up the idea of using spa and pool as i didnt want to risk,0
 clean comfortable good location,1
 the hotel is extremely dirty staff is incompetent and they don t care there was poop spots on the wc seat and around it on the wall when we checked in at 4 pm we informed the reception who didn t do anything and we discovered this at night went back to complain and they handed over to me a sponge and cleaning product and advised me to do it myself no manager came in to check about the complaint or bothered calling,0
 great location friendly tempus bar beautiful building and opposite park and the history such as george the dragon good quality breakfast as always with ph just missing touches such as tea pots tea cups and fruit coulis etc,1
 lovely old hotel is quiet georgian square between paddington and bayswater close to both paddington and lancaster gate tube also convenient for hyde park ,1
 small rooms and much noise from the highway windows weaker ,0
 room was disgustingly filthy,0
 the room has a great view london eye very good space nice bath large tv in the living room medium one in the bed room and very useful kitchen kit small but very beneficial ,1
 my bed was under a skylight at 5am something dropped from that skylight and hit me on the face i turned on the light to see what it was and was surprised to see a live maggot on my bed i spent the rest of the night on the sofa i put the maggot in a glass and presented it to reception on leaving and asked whether i might be able to get a refund i was offered an upgrade of my breakfast from normal to continental i replied that there was no way in the world i would be eating in the hotel no manager was available to speak to me ,0
 large room good size singles,1
 very comfy bed,1
 location was great close to the train station and lots of great food options ,1
 the room was to a very high standard from the small touches like coffee maker in the room to the amazingly comfy bed and 5 star breakfast the staff were very polite dressed immaculately and would do anything to help ,1
 great location for theatre well fitted great staff,1
 the bathroom shower was terrible and the shower did not work well my daughter got stuck in bathroom with terrible lock had to call someone to let her out no fridge to keep water,0
 hotel architecture has a traditional english heritage charm which makes my stay feel authentic yet has modern facilities to ensure a pleasant stay room is new and clean though small there s a welcome basket of fruits and chocolates in the room which are appreciated hotel is conveniently located from kensington garden queensway and bayswater underground ,1
 very unhelpful and unfriendly and unflexible managment we wanted to change the room we booked in the beginning because no one mentioned the room we booked does not fit the guest amount however they were complicating it ,0
 the room was tiny and had no windows i therefore felt extremely claustrophobic there was no room service ,0
 stank of paint which gave us a headache lots of mess such as sawdust on the floor its also in a nasty location near all strip clubs which they fail to mention the rooms are nothing like the photos,0
 quiet good bathroom,1
 dated hotel bad bed untidy bathroom paid wifi which did not work even after paying rusted taps nothing worked for me in this hotel,0
 the rooms were tiny and outdated the bathroom was inadequate and very small the service was slow when we checked in at midnight despite there being 6 staff around reception only one was serving so it took us 20 minutes to get checked in way over priced for what it was ,0
 the room the bed people from reception not that helpful etc ,0
 centrally location for visit ease of check in out politeness and helpfulness of all staff atmosphere within the hotel breakfast very good,1
 staff the rooms the deco the fact it took 2 hrs to get my window opened and further 1 hr to get it shut which ment it was almost 1 am once aka got to bed,0
 loved the location and the room and view was to die for great value for money will defo be back ,1
 i didn t like the staff they where so rude we didn t stay in the end,0
 staff were very helpful and friendly ,1
 the stuff was lovely the lobby bar restaurant very nice the location excellent near the park and arounf the corner from well connected public transport ,1
 very close to museum and concert hall area ,1
 the hotel is close to some hospitals thus the whole day and night there were ambulances noise ,0
 room temperature room service,0
 the room was the smallest one i have ever had in any hotel in any country my legs did not fit in the bed and there was a continuous noise from the street also during the night the breakfast was well very basic ,0
 despite asking for a quiet room we didn t get one room was very small only just enough room to open the door when entering,0
 great location rooms well equipped and clean,1
 building site and noise to go with it when i paid extra for a river view executive suite bathroom needed maintenance work to fix toilet and light fitting hanging down over bath and it smelled damp was very expensive and i didn t get value for my money and when problems where reported no discount offered won t be going back ,0
 friendly helpful staff the facilities are good including the bar the earl s court tube station is just a few steps away and this station has access to several useful lines for what you get the prices are reasonable very nice breakfast buffet ,1
 the hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to the underground station of earls court very friendly staff delicious breakfast ,1
 staff lovely brilliant views great vacilitys great location ,1
 view from the room,1
 good comfy bed good sized room,1
 staff couldn t be freindlier and do enough for you but remained professional at all times booked a private function for 25 of us ages ranged from 19 79 the catering and events dept were faultless perfect location for soho covent garden and theatre land ,1
 bald carpet in room booked on line and asked for lowest floor room i could get and then also rang to confirm this a week or so after despite this was put on 8th floor intially when complained moved to 6th floor but person booking in in front of me was wasked if he wished the 3 4th floor when queried they did have record of my request but hadnt bothered to reserve a room for us ,0
 room wasn t ready until 3 30 no room in the bar no facilities,0
 excellent location friendly and helpful staff stored our luggage after check out clean and comfortable room very convenient for several buses and it was lovely to just cross the road and be in kensington gardens ,1
 they did not receive confirmation from booking com so there was no room available after waiting 30 mins they said will a holiday inn 10 mins taxi away do no after a further 10 mins the only room they could put us in was a double 2 guys because we where meeting other people in the area we had no choice but take it no compensation offered by the hotel because it was booking com fault ,0
 do not under any circumstances book the small single room this is room g2 this is literally a store cupboard with a short bed crammed into the corner and a tiny wet cell for a bathroom i m not the tallest person 5 5 165cm but the bed in this room was far too short even for me i also had to move it away from the wall a little bit as this is an outside wall mostly of the wall is a drafty window actually and as a result absolutely freezing even with the bed nudged away from the wall i still woke up with a raging headache as there was a draft from the window all night and any part of me that was not covered by the duvet was cold and damp this house would also do well with stocking up on wd 40 the door hinges creak squeak and whine rather loudly something that being in room g2 you will not be able to avoid witnessing the room is adjacent to the door leading to the breakfast room and for some reason someone kept going in and out of it until 2 30am and then again from around 6 30am onwards it doesn t take a genius to work out how much sleep i actually got with the room also being under the stairs definitely not in a cute way like in harry potter and just opposite the hotel entrance you will hear all the comings and goings no matter how quiet the minority of people try to be if it s not their footsteps or voices waking keeping you up it will be the squeaky doors as for the bathroom i was amazed at the outstanding water pressure of the hand held shower head unfortunately the physical size of the actual shower can t quite cope with the masses of water shooting out of the shower head so you will be flooding the bathroom even if you re conscious of it and try had to avoid it consequently you ll be flooding the bedroom too so make sure to move everything off the little floor space there is around the bed before you attempt to shower ,0
 the room was very clean and spacious with plenty of facilities bathroom really attractive and pleasant to use ,1
 the service levels provided from entering the hotel even before entering the reception and until we left again was in a levels so high you cannot learn it you live it ,1
 good location easy access to various tube lines,1
 good location nice neighbourhood ,1
 cosy reception area and bar with opulent decor wood paneling and buttoned leather sofas,1
 the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in in my entire life ,1
 the check in staff intercommunicated the breakfast plan the check out staff was fairly rude in delivering the message that breakfast is not included and inpatient when i was all confused about the info,0
 good location helpful staff room s big and clean about 10min walk to temple station ,1
 ongoing building work with associated noise,0
 didn t have teh 19 50 breakfast went to local cafe for 5 80 instead,0
 for 1st time in london was a nice pleasant place to stay,1
 room sizes cleanliness poor response from hotel management ,0
 great location and property,1
 the beds and mattresses are ancient a hotel of the caliber should have better beds the rooms are old and tired i would not stay here again ,0
 ,1
 the bathroom was very nice and rain shower was great to have staff was friendly and courteous but more knowledge about places to eat or see around the hotel would be nice ,1
 the welcome and service provided by the concierge staff was excellent we particularly appreciated the attention and courtesy of carey and bernard who remembered us from previous visits and went out of their way to help us and make us feel at home we travel a lot and in our experience those two are in a special class we would come back for them alone ,1
 unpleasant smell in the room was overwhelming,1
 services and recpaption feedback they were very rude,0
 great location everything we needed ,1
 despite trying to change my booking 10 minutes after the wrong booking date was chosen not sure how as it was a random date they would not move the date or refund the money awful customers service,0
 the staff was rude and racist ,0
 night staff were disinterested and security an issue had to phone security staff to come and deal with an issue as they were no where to be seen found out they were out the back smoking ,0
 i traveled so many countries with 5 star hotel but i never seen that kind of bad service hotel you can find more reasonable good quality hotels instead of this hotel 1 metro station is only 5 min distance but usually weekend is out of working 2 room was tiny and noisy we complained about that and they changed the room with more noisy and double bed we are two women and our room was twin and urine smell eventhough i spent all my parfum but that smell was continued so we had to come back to our previous room one reception guy helped us only for one luggage peevishly unkindly we had 4 luggage also when i realized i forgot my shoes in the room i called to hotel for checking 1 day later they said no shoes in the room eventhough 200 certainly i put my shoes in our room i totally can say that reception especially in charge of luggage is unkind and house keeping is quite suspisious i definitely do not recommend this hotel ,0
 really nice room,1
 in general we enjoyed our stay staff very helpful,1
 cleanliness staff breakfast,1
 everything extremely clean and comfy staff very friendly and helpful,1
 everything,0
 after waiting for 2 hours over our check in time i finally visited the front desk after watching numerous older couples successfully getting a room key and after explaining that i was told to wait for a room and then watching other go through miraculously a room became available i felt throughly discriminated against because we was a younger couple then after walking around london all day we wanted to order room service after 3 trips to the reception and 1 broken phone we finally got 2 lots of fish and chips i never usually complain and this may seem like mediocre complaints but when it s your fianc s birthday you just want everything to be perfect highly disappointed ,0
 dated unclean and small rooms ,0
 lift,0
 lovely helpful staff great location,1
 modern very clean and very friendly hotel well located food in the restaurant was excellent staff very attentive and nothing too much trouble readily adapted the menu for the children to suit would definitely recommend and stay here again ,1
 staff and breakfast were excellent,1
 room was rather cramped and in clear need of attention refurbishment the curtains were not mounted hanging correctly so the blackout effectiveness was seriously compromised wallpaper was peeling and the view was terrible i won t be returning there ,0
 fab boutique hotel gr8 location very near hyde park paddington tube station very helpful staff also the reservations rep mandeep really looked after my stay room upgrade plus wine beverages fruits in my room,1
 after we arrived in the hotel at 13 45 ms at the front desk told us we must wait 3 pm bacause she don t have free rooms and after that she was made seven check in for new guests in the first room they gave us it was incredibly cold after we complain they gave us another room which was better and with normal temperatur ,0
 iron didn t work in the room requested an iron but didn t have the right plug for the sockets in the room ordered room service which didn t arrive and when i called to check my order the restaurant had closed got something else from the 24 hour menu but they still tried to charge me the room service delivery charges not good customer service ,0
 rude staff there was a mouse running around freely in the lounge restaurant area air con heating far too loud i asked for a taxi to get to my meeting after 15 minutes realised she hadn t even called it ,0
 the location was great and the staff were really nice ,1
 excellent massage by an expert for both orthopaedic and stress related problems ,1
 very nice and comfirtable hotel i personally like it thank you front desk staff cheers,1
 very good hotel staff were excellent resteraunt food very good,1
 convenient location and grand building,1
 the hotel is incredibly handy to earl s court station we loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet g t at the end of each hectic day in london we ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located there was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing we ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well ,1
 actually the staff was so cooperative and friendly ,1
 brilliant staff room breakfast and an all round great find for me now i know it s there i will 100 return,1
 you place someone more constantly at the entrance door to assist with guest luggages thanks,0
 room size and bed size are very small comparef to what we paid for,0
 derelict building next door not too attractive room size tiny not even enough room for two bedside tables despite being a 4 double room literally room only to squeeze around the bed for the money they charge i d expect to be able at least to walk normally around the bed not shuffle sideways and i am not in any way a large or overweight person the rooms are just tiny no mini fridge in the room even though there is an empty cupboard in the desk that is mini fridge sized had to wedge the room door as it rattled noisliy any time people walked outside or closed the fire door just outside the room ,0
 brilliant location hotel comfortable and clean staff very friendly and helpful lovely view over london from our 5th floor room breakfast excellent lovely garden wouldn t hesitate to stay here again and recommend it very good value for money ,1
 bed was ridiculously uncomfortable never slept all night tossing and turning the following business day meeting was a poor performance due to the previous nights sleep will never visit this hotel again nor will i ever endorse it absolute joke ,0
 misleading pictures on the website and description of facilities etc had been overly dressed up in the overall description we are experienced well mannered travellers and this is the first time i feel compelled to actually write a bad rewiev will possibly seek legal advise on the whole treatment received ,0
 poor standard for price clean but very shabby single beds rather than double leaking air conditioning unit which left a large wet puddle on carpet and dripped constantly and when i complained about it they said someone would look at it and nobody did which i thought was really bad wasn t happy about how much i had to pay due to that,0
 the location is perfect especially on sunny weather my family loved it highly recommend ,1
 cleaning smell room service facilities,0
 there was no water from 9am till 6pm we weren t even told had to find out by reading a small piece of paper,0
 very small room hardly any space next to the bed bed was not really good airco not working no fridge or minibar worn out room paper in hallways coming loose cleaning staff leaving hoover in hallway see you coming with suitcase and don t even bother clearing the way so you have to pick up your suitcase and walk over it main lights in room did not work rust on the toilet seat lot s of noise at backside of hotel very early in the morning this should not be called a hotel ,0
 the location is excellent direct route from the airport at heathrow the hotel is clean and modern and has basic amenities breakfast room bar the street is quiet a good hotel if travelling on business ,1
 hotel rooms don t meets hilton standard no shower pressure rooms are old fashioned ,0
 the service was not great no one said hello goodbye when we would come in leave there was no turn down service no towels were replaced very expensive though a much cheaper rate was offered on your website but the hotel could do nothing about it the light flickered in the room two beds were stuck together no nail file even upon request a basic amenity had to bring up our own luggage despite telling reception we needed it to change for a lunch reservation we waited then called down to ask about its location then we waited then got fed up of waiting so went to collect it from downstairs ourselves at 370 euros definitely not worth the money very disappointed ,0
 after i paid the bill the receptionist told me that the room is in another building across the street in the basement i went there the room smelled humidity i couldent stay there was not enough air to breathe so i went back asked for another room he said there is no other room available ii wanted a refund he said you cant get a refund he called the owner she told me to send her an email she will let me know tomorrow morning she must consult with someone about the refund finally i told them i have a family in london i will call him to come and pick me up and i will call the police because the address of that room is different than the address of the hotel finally they refund my credit card i am not sure yet that i got my money back ,0
 good sized room for the price and wonderfully located having its own bar and restaurant on site was a bonus despite there being countless foodie drinkie options outside their doors ,1
 location easy to get downtown and to local pubs everyone was kind and helpful would stay here again ,1
 tiny room windows wouldn t open freezing shower in morning room hot and air con wouldn t work receptionist very unhelpful and no apologies meant to stay 2 nights but checked out after one no manager on duty to discuss getting a refund so left my comments and contact details as yet no ones bothered dreadful place ,0
 the room was large the beds were very comfortable the lifts appeared quickly when summoned we liked the ambience and the beautiful staircase ,1
 the location of the hotel,1
 liked the ambiance very friendly staff good bed although the room was small it was pleasant clean,1
 hard to find hotel reception is behind the bar at a coffeshop the room had no windows no airflow ac was really bad too hot and lack of fresh air made the nights impossible to sleep through ,0
 utter luxury loved it ,1
 the location and cleanliness is perfect,1
 second time having booked this hotel for its location to be informed at checkin there are no rooms and i would have to stay at another hotel tried to cancel so i could re book but advised by staff this was no possible ,0
 very bad service staff very rude no free wifi as you said over priced room very small,0
 location staff,1
 staff is not helpful facilities like ac is not working or very poor no perks being offered ,0
 no flexibility re cancellation although we have used this hotel for business purposes on a large number of occasions ,0
 the friendly and helpful staff ,1
 great secluded garden would be fantastic in summer very helpful and friendly staff bed room comfortable and very quiet ,1
 location and views great studio itself was lovely with good amenities soundproofing of the windows was also good ,1
 very little space in the room bathroom was tiny was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan and humming noise was constant when turned on also if temperature was set at less than 20c the unit was extremely noisy had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room ,0
 comfortable room nice comfortable bed good location kept clean always,1
 the room was clean as was the whole hotel and it was very comfortable and relaxing ,1
 not at all satisfied i won t book again this hotel the room was really small even if i have booked a superior room i have asked information regarding gatwick express and the staff at the concierge told me to check the web site since it was not their duty to provide information ,0
 near station of bus and tran so close to hyed park,1
 the location of the toilet facilities was poor to reach the tissue you had to twist your back and bang your hand on the lever ,0
 i had a single room it was perfect for its use bed was confortable shower good breakfast buffet with everything you need ,1
 room was not modern as advertised was not dissimilar to some sort of victorian hell bed was unstable four poster bed was put in a small room making it cramped and blocked the light which made it dingy ,0
 many issues every time i visit this hotel i see drop in performance un qualiyfied reception team rooms missing facilities and billing issues i used to like this hotel but this time they tried to froud me by adding 13 for mini bar that i did not use and they added 1 for charity without informing me if you don have other choice i recommend you becareful ,0
 room was clean great shower decent wifi request one of the rooms on the outside overlooking a little park 10 minute walk to paddington station,1
 the glamour of the reception areas the location of the hotel ,1
 everything shower was cold staff were not helpful,0
 great location beautiful old building lovely bar ,1
 the location,1
 this is not a 4 star hotel by any means the breakfast had literally no choices no options for vegetarians staff was not so co operative ,0
 needs a refurb plumbing is poor,0
 elevator out of order for more than 24 hours carrying luggage through small staircase passage was very hard single glazing and bad ventilation made the room s temperature very volatile no airconditioning to compensate shower room far to small for even a slim sized couple ,0
 rude staff not helpful very small rooms,0
 the location was excellent near plenty of bars restaurantshops coffee shops and two tube stations ,1
 the staff were super friendly and it was an incredible room bed was very comfortable and service was amazing we got a free upgrade to a king room which was amazing ,1
 bed was super soft breakfast was superb very clean hotel and ideal for the 02 arena ,1
 given room that had not been cleaned yuck after we complained we were swapped to a smaller room the new room s a c unit didn t work so we barely slept for two nights ,0
 everything,0
 i have left behind a skirt part of a two piece ensemble in my room which i noticed immediately and called from the train to ask to locate it and keep it at the front desk so that when i returned to london in a couple of days i could pick it up i also followed up this request with a e mail asking to get back to me as soon as they can they did not do anything when i arrived two days later they told me they did not find anything but when i talked to the manager he assured me that he will call the cleaner and will get back to me shorty he never did the manager lied to me about his assistance knowing that i will leave next day and the whole problem will disappear with me you have a better chance to find anything you accidentally leave behind in a public place than in this hotel even if you try hard to get it back ,0
 we visited here with another couple and although we both booked a classic double room which in the booking description detailed in below picture had a bath we were placed in a room with a tiny shower and no bath the shower was so small that you bashed your elbow on the tap and brushed the shower door as you turned we complained to the reception who told us that there was two types of double rooms and the ones with the bath were all booked we could only get a bath if we paid for an upgrade we found the receptionist very rude and unhelpful i find this really outrageous as they advertise the room as with a bath in our opinion a double bed was shoved in a single box room and attempted to be passed as a double the whole room was tiny our mini bar only had one soft drink when we arrived and they tried to charge us for the listed contents of the fridge when we checked out good location but disappointing room for the expensive price you pay for a supposed 4 star hotel we traveled many countries in europe and this hotel was the worst ,0
 room was clean warm and cozy ,1
 room service was terrible tv was blurry air conditioning was loud bad experience ,0
 the rooms will either be facing a noisy road in the front or a building site in the rear windows are leaking and therefore very cold during the night breakfast served in the basement is just terrible,0
 i had been waiting for a long time after checked in as the room wasn t ready it was absolutely nonsense why i had to wait for 90 mins at the lobby so disappointed ,0
 ther reception is the cash desk of a costa type coffee shop breakfast served in said shop no residents lounge or bar continental breakfast ok full english was 12 50 and consisted of scramled egg 2xhash browns 1x sausage and beans all warmed up in the microwave by the coffee shop girl receptionist not a full english by my standards and a total rip off we visited for the cricket as the hotel is near the ground however the immediate are is not at all nice quite intimidating to say the least at a cost of 309 00 for 2 nights for 2 we we re ripped off extremely dissappointed big mistake ,0
 on arrival reception smelt odd like old frying fat arrived at 2 30 to check in and our room was not ready told it would be five minutes it took an additional half an hour room was large bathroom floor was incredibly slippy and the bathroom was cold odd shaped hole in the ceiling with fragile looking panels was a little off,0
 almost everything could have been better we have been staying at the courthouse for 10 years so over 10 visits it used to be a fantastic hotel in every respect however it is well over due for a refurb it is tatty and tired no excuse for painted walls to look shabby rooms are dated and tatty bed was in need of throwing out together with the bed linen it was appalling usually this hotel provide little touches that i have found as standard all over the world robes toiletries and a fresh set of towels each day we had to ask for house keeping to visit the room not best pleased staff were fairly helpful but also seemed miserable and fully aware the hotel was not up to standard we were told as much by the supervisor who offered a free upgrade to a magistrate suite as she was used to guests complaining we refused the upgrade as it was far worse than the room we already had all in all we came back because of location but even 2 years ago it was looking bad but we used to love this hotel so went back we will not be returning until it is refurbished i have only left feedback because i would hate for this hotel to be a let down for that special anniversary or birthday the hotel cost us 600 for 2 nights not the most expensive nor the cheapest but for less money we could have stayed somewhere that was in less of a state inside ,0
 the hotel location is excellent,1
 the rooms are old and not clean clrealy need some renovations ,0
 amazing breakfast ,1
 rom 5 m2 verry small munuscule,0
 they changed us to another hotel because they hadnt enough rooms ,0
 when we arrived we were told we weren t staying at the hotel and that they d called me and informed me no they never i was really annoyed we had to check in there and a chap took our two bags up westbourne terrace and across the road to an entirely different hotel due to building works apparently had booked luxury rooms at the booked hotel had little more than broom closets in the alternative offered if we hadn t been rushing to get out for the theatre wouldn t have stayed our two single rooms were so small they didn t even have a bedside table and that was for my mums birthday mothers day treat sorry mum refund please ,0
 dirty bed and bathroom a c didn t work properly ,0
 the so called spacious suite was a box the kitchinette is in a wardrobe the curtains wouldn t close in our room if you put the lights on in the bathroom at night the bedroom lit up from the rear of the recessed lights unfinished diy i guess the apathetic staff moved us for the second night but point blank refused a discount for my lack of sleep ,0
 the room was filled with ugly old furniture and ugly style totally not worth the price i paid not up to standard compared to many hilton hotels i have been to before not worth the price i wasn t happy with my stay at all,0
 location friendliness,1
 the room is very small i think the bath room is just few inches smaller than the bathroom i could not say if my bed is single or single and half for sure the bed was not double the carapet is dirty and i have ashma so i felt not well that night and i tossed and turned ,0
 great room nice and compact but tidy and comfortable,1
 the staff were not informative or helpful our requests for quiet room were met with a placement right next to the building works of the hotel and when contacted regarding adjoining room door which meant no soundproofing no assistance given our room also had an additional portable bed placed in it which was not requested and made the room completely small we reduced our stay from 5 to 1 night and would never return substandard on all levels,0
 bath rooms not clean accommodation were not as requested ,0
 great location quiet city centre in walking distance comfortable well equipped except tv room and modern bathroom ,1
 the door cannot be locked inside and in one midnight a strange man opened the door and wanted to pee in my bath room the hotel insists the door was open i cannot believe i didnot close the door for whole night furthermore the employee is not in good manner to response this incident they simply want to get rid of the resonsbility from this incident not a word to appology at all unbelivable ,0
 just used as base,1
 nice hotel in a great location near sorbonne rooms are small but confortable and have exposed beams fairly standard hotel furniture and fittings and small bathroom beginning to show signs of wear friendly staff ,1
 great design and bathroom super bed very comfortable ,1
 location ease of checking in out,1
 the personal try to charge me the breakfest also when i did the check out they ask me evean the breakfast we did nt have it we never wake up so early to eat the breakfest that was not nice because we check out 5 o clock in the morning when you are not really wake i explain them we did nt have it and in the end they charge just was we have use it verry expensive the mini bar 1 red bull 9 eurooo the personal was not really good for the hotel with 4 star we don t get every morning the biscuit and chocolate what we must become from the hotel that s was on the free mini bar next time i will search for my group another hotel ,0
 the building which is magnificant and the internal decor it is like a palace ,1
 poor welcome at reception and given wrong room key so had to return from 5 the floor to get replacement heating sensor in room broken so arrival temperature was 32 degrees reported it no action taken tea and coffee facilities not topped up most solid and uncomfortable pillows i ve ever had generally felt that hotel was trying to be a boutique hotel but failed just seemed as if nothing quite worked and staff certainly weren t at a level that one would expect for that cost compared to other wembley hotels massively overpriced ,0
 convenience of locality and good sized room ,1
 bed very nice room large,1
 location room and staff better facilities the a premier inn and well apportioned rooms ,1
 veiw from room was amazing ,1
 artisan restaurant was slow service and bland food rooms were like saunas we had an executive room so god knows how bad the standard rooms were paid for breakfast but service was that slow on the buffet breakfast that the queue was out the restaurant and passed reception i paid 130 to stay here and quickly wanted to check out cause i was disgusted and then got hit with a 27 car park bill and that s with hotel occupants discount won t be staying here again ,0
 loved the garden good breakfast,1
 we loved that it was located in a nice quiet neighborhood not in a touristy location so close to public transportation and walking places the staff was always available and friendly breakfast was tasty and the hostess was so sweet she remembered exactly how we liked our coffee although the rooms are small ours was perfect we will request a room higher up and with a balcony next time there wasn t one available on this trip ,1
 staff rude very expensive lift didn t work jacuzzi was closed took too much money from my credit card,0
 staff are so friendly and welcoming the hotel itself is lovely and quite grand loved the big tv on the wall in the room ,1
 was told check in was at 2 told to come back at 3 had to climb 6 sets of stairs with 2 pregnant friends had no lifts wifi codes wasn t given when checking in no extra linen for spare bed not enough towels per guest phone wasn t working in room to contact reception bed was filthy toilet was broken and smelt broken furnature unsympathetic staff on checking out no apology just told to email my compliant overall stay shocking ,0
 great location beautiful hotel and good service,1
 nice pillows and clean room,1
 the ac didn t work for the first day discourteous staff and receptionists didn t match with our rest of the booking com experience at all during this europe tour it sucked ,0
 the staff is very helpful and always willing to help it is very clean and the rooms are nice,1
 nice and clean well renovated ,1
 polite and friendly staff ,1
 the room was comfortable and the separate shower was nice the kichenette was also nice to have ,1
 fire alarm was going off when we got there first room we went to smelt of smoke and the window didn t lose properly so we had all the noise from the road outside and a really annoying draft we spoke to reception who happily moved us rooms then the fire alarm went off again the first night we were there for almost 45 mins this was at 10pm after this we had no lights in our room and had to wait until we had left the room the next day before they were sorted bed was hard and not very comfy a very forced apology was given by the reception but no offer of any compensation was ever made almost as if they really didn t care this was a few nights away for my birthday which was completely ruined by the experience at this hotel ,0
 the room was nice,1
 omg it was an amazing place to be from the entrance view to the rooms resturant and bar the staff where amazing especially the concierge the spa was good am diffnately coming back,1
 nice modern premises friendly staff good gym,1
 overall a pretty good hotel staff where great,1
 the room was noisy the staff were rude i was woken up at midnight with room service that i didn t order the waiter didn t even apologise for waking me up ,0
 gave us the worst room in the hotel 2 flights of stairs no offer yo deliver luggage to room same floor as event rooms music so loud unable to sleep went down to reception at 3am to complain checked out for early flight at 6 30am with hotel telling us because we prepaid they couldn t do anything apart from offer us s better room on our next visit as if ,0
 v bad service old hotel and beds need to be changed cleening rooms was v bad they need to be trained i was cleaning my room every day first time happened in my life,0
 i forgot high value flash drive with personal information in the safe box called same day i checked out its gone clearly it was stolen that incident completely changed aftertaste from the stay ,0
 we were forced by the check in staff that we need to pre pay for quick check out she said that the invoice would be emailed upon check out her manner was appalling we were shocked at the way we were treated ,0
 the rooms were pokey 1st room they gave us smelt like a fish market 2nd room smelt like an ash tray hate complaining never do it but had to third room was ok but the staff weren t bothered i reckon as we booked through booking com no way they would treat hilton bookers like that they decided to renovate the next door room at 8am sun and monday morning noise was unbearable very annoying again staff didn t care said they needed to redecorate to be fair they got that right room was in need ,0
 furniture is very old and bad breakfast at executive lounge is same menu every days i stayed 8 days and food the same every day ,0
 all staff were cheery and helpful,1
 that definitely is not a 4 star hotel needs a lot of upgrades,0
 our room was clean cosy and quiet excellent powerful shower and added bonus of under floor heating the breakfast buffet was amazing very polite and helpful staff we will definitely be returning on our next visit ,1
 everything ,0
 overall it was a lovely hotel clean and tidy lovey rooms location was great with bercy village close round the corner we got the king duplex and was a good size breakfast downstairs was great staff are fantastic,1
 shabby tiny rooms poor attention to detail by staff ,0
 soundproofing of lift shaft constant noise from lifts all night no sleep whatsoever when i complained staff were rude and flippant ,0
 we liked everything about the hotel so much that we booked an extra night would highly recommend the staff are all lovely and the rooms are kept very clean 10 10,1
 our room was not the room we thought we had booked there website wasn t accurate our bed was covered in hairs the buffet was awful and our trip was ruined due to the experience of our hotel ,0
 the room elevator hallways and stairs were extremely small narrow regarding the elevator only one person with luggage 1 can fit hopefully you re not claustrophobic ,0
 the toilet has glass walls no privacy the room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small i don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars the day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel ,0
 very comfortable clean refurbished and great location ,1
 great hotel centrally situated alongside the thames and bigben staff are very friendly and helpful will definately book at this hotel again,1
 excellent location helpful and friendly staff ,1
 very nice atmosphere and fantastic and super friendly staff,1
 bad service,0
 everything the walls and ceiling were broken the style is from the 90s the air conditioning was not cool enough the parking people were not professional and very slow ,0
 the room is so small you can t even find a place where to open your suitcase we went out for diner came back at midnight the receptionist was standing outside smoking and he had forgotten to remove the security on the door we were locked inside for 1 hour trying to wake up someone on the 2nd floor to open for us next day the management was not even aware and still after knowing they were asking us to pay extra 5 tax for our night really shocking ,0
 hotel is in a very rough neighborhood hotel room was very dodgy and had was not a good room breakfast charges were very high compared to the items provided there was no room service and the lighting was very bad in general did not have basic needs around ,0
 we were in room 001 very noisy next door to some kind of back packers kept us up until 2 am in the morning that was thursday friday and saturday as for the room above us it would wake us up when they flushed the toilet or ran the water the room was also for a disabled person which i never requested when i was shown to my room when checking in i asked don t you have double beds so all in all we were not happy you need to paint the ceiling where you had a water leak not nice looking up at that at night also no bedside lamps every time you got into bed you need to get out to put the lights off ,0
 lovely old building pleasant staff very handy for hyde park concerts lancaster gate tube station about 5 mins walk ,1
 beautiful property with history,1
 sraff were unhelpful at check in miserable decoration staff s english very poor tv did not work bathroom fixtures broken,0
 could not fault the service and accommodation a wonderful hotel ,1
 location and hotel decor were great gym and lobby were nice ,1
 i booked this hotel room in april of 2016 to make sure i got the best price and that i could actually get a room upon arrival everything seemed fine off we went to the horse show and returned at 11 30 to go to the bar as we had done for 5 years on the trot on a saturday night and also i might add more or less the reason we go to the show we were turned away as fei had a party and we did not have the wrist bands i could bore you with all the details that ensued after this i e abysmal staff service ignorance and inability to help from everyone involved but the long and short of this story is that the hotel staff here did not provide the services that we had paid for and tried to get away with claiming no responsibility really ruined my london trip away and will definitely be my last time paying to stay here ,0
 the whole experience here was wonderful the staff were so helpful and friendly the food was utterly delicious and the bed bedroom was the best we have ever experienced ,1
 corner room which had amazing views of the thames and the most comfortable bed i ve ever slept in ,1
 landry service was auful they will charge for huge amount but was not properly washed at all they will give you a wifi code which is only accesscible with one device per code and room was extremely small compared to other rooms that you could get with same value,0
 bed uncomfortable room tiny no wifi signal noisy terrible experience,0
 the bed was extremely comfortable and the deluxe double room was just fine for a solo traveler although i think it would be a little small for two people ,1
 kind staff good location easy access to metro ,1
 is the worst possible location the hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station ,0
 i did not like the fact that that the bathroom and toilet were separate mattress was also very farm and would have preferred medium at the end the manager managed to fix something but still the problem was there and i did not sleep well ,0
 very clean and modern,1
 closeness to piccadilly line and general ambience of the hotel,1
 do not stay in room 015 tucked away in a dingy basement with no view it was plagued by a the frequent rumbling of underground trains from 05 30 am and b a random outside light switching itself on and off at regular intervals,0
 excellent hotel right next to the o2 arena the breakfast was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very spacious,1
 bedroom outlook awful bed uncomfortable not very clean not great value for money ,0
 i was given a room with no windows tiny room with tiny bed and no windows really strange having no natural daylight but having instead a window to the bathroom wall that divided the bathroom from the room was clear glass ,0
 we enjoyed great views from most windows and the breakfast had everything we liked the pool very much and were almost alone there all of the staff was extremely friendly we were allowed to rearrange our booking to a different day even though our room was not refundable that was very nice of them ,1
 upon arrival we were shifted to a sister hotel because of boiler problems the hotels are rated four star but should be rated two star the tv had bad reception room service only left body cream and shower gel the first night the room was extremely small and closet space inadequate breakfast was fair with limited selection ,0
 the staff were awful i d never stay here again ,0
 there are two truths to this property s description yes it s in london yes it s on hyde park this is where it ends the grand royale is no hotel it is a hostel whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here the room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else ,0
 the room was amazing we were given an upgrade so it was a real treat the view from the windows was lovely we decided to stay in the hotel restaurant to eat before going into the o2 for a concert again that was an excellent choice the food was lovely i would certainly stay there again if i had a concert to go to ,1
 very good hotel one of the best i have stayed in in london,1
 staff were lovely beautiful old historical building,1
 a lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff they went out of their way to stop a light flashing on the phone beside the bed which would have lit up the room every minute otherwise ,1
 very small basement room no room to get around the bed or to unpack meant to be a superior room but was definitely inferior ,0
 conveniently situated friendly and helpful staff beautiful view from hotel room ,1
 ohhh well shall we let the list begin with check in 1 the staff seemed more focused on talking to their boyfriends on the phone or discussing the latest hot guy in a magazine rather than helping guests 2 the place desperately needs a facelift i had strong memories resurface of trying to clean my grandmother s flat the dust settling onto a different surface with each step taken the sheets were stained with god only knows what and the bathroom tiles were falling off 3 i appreciate a free upgrade as much as the next guy to come along but when i a solo traveller on a business trip just wants a nice place to lay his head and do some work i want one bed a desk and a chair instead the free upgrade they gave me consisted of a stained queen bed with two single beds stuffed i to the room as well as if i was a child trying to build a very loose definition of a fort at least i had two ridiculously small non stained beds to choose from i ll give them one thing the pillows weren t bad ,0
 the trainee receptionist was very professional on check out ,1
 dinner was awful and breakfast was shambles with half the dishes missing staff tried but could not understand english well so communication was hopeless bedroom was very tired with frayed carpets and the bathroom so tiny that if a person was large they could not sit on the toilet pillows so thin that we needed to ask for 5 each in total to get a decent nights sleep ,0
 location and staff,1
 indifferent staff no lift from ground floor tiny bedroom we needed a one way system to reach the inadequate wardrobe pathetic breakfast in very congested corner of the reception area not impressed at all ,0
 excellent location walking distance to the louvre and notre dame cathedral easy access to subway which takes you to champs elysees and the eiffel tower many restaurants and cafes withing walking distance to the hotel staff were very accommodating and helpful rooms are a good size compared to european standards ,1
 i got charged twice and it took me four phone calls and significant frustration to receive a refund i ve booked here before and travel to london for work many times a year i won t stay again ,0
 breakfast was amazing room was also very good overall very nice stay ,1
 location room was clean and comfortable,1
 great location for travel into central london hotel staff great and great ambience,1
 love the bottles of water really helped ,1
 the room was very small and old ,0
 terrible parking which we were charged twice for then had to carry our cases up two flights of stairs to reception long queues for checking in checking out breakfast rude hotel staff housekeeping supervisor barged in our room whithout knocking telling us we shouldn t be in the room then after nearly an hour of waiting not knowing what was going on we were told we could stay in the room paid extra for a bigger room with balcony and river city view but the room still felt cramped and the bathroom was tiny the door hit the loo when you opened it and there was barely a square foot to stand in the whole bathroom as for the balcony with view the river city could only be seen if you stood right at the edge of the balcony and stretched your neck right over and round poor quality breakfast bacon was more fat than meat and the rest was tasteless when i tried to complain whilst checking out i was shot down and ushered off as quickly as possible real let down expected a lot more from this hotel ,0
 the warm room ,1
 overall we had a very good experience the location is quite good 2 min walk from the london eye across the bridge from big ben it is very clean and comfortable the staff is very friendly and helpful they literally saved our trip see the cons part bottom line very good experience,1
 rooms very comfortable good location ,1
 no bath no milk for tea just creamif you need milk you have to pay english poeple like milk not what you would get from hoilday inn,0
 the hotel found out it was my 60th birthday and they upgraded our room we met our friends for cocktails in the brumus bar which had a good range of cocktails they even arranged fantastic weather all blue sky ,1
 it was all really rather nice,1
 great sized room especially for london,1
 the carpet was disgusting the walls had mold on them and were stained the windows were dirty the general cleanliness of the hotel was one of the poorest i ve ever stayed in definitely not a 3 start should be advertised as 2 urgently needs to undergo a renovation,0
 on the reception people have no ideaabout their job ,0
 not a four seasons by service or quality of facilities just by name ,0
 the staff were extremely friendly and helpful for london standards the room was relatively spacious and very clean ,1
 comfortable and modern hotel rooms were quiet with large bathroom friendly staff ,1
 great location with friendly staff rooms are clean and modern but small as usual in london hotels lots of different restaurants in the area such as lebanese malaysia indian italian malaysia pubs ,1
 location friendly staff garden,1
 rooms without window not even one star,0
 location is great,1
 good breakfast lot of cholce fresh food,1
 we had a small well laid out room the shower was heavenly the bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was smart perhaps the best feature was the ability to open the windows the hotel is in such a quiet location ,1
 the service and staff efficiency bar and restaurant are always good at this hotel in my experience ,1
 a lovely place to stay very close to the metro and the luxembourg gardens ,1
 this was my all life best hotel and beautiful balding i love to stay again and very central under ground is very near big supermarket is very near what us you need in central london,1
 booked a double room and got 2 single beds pushed but not locked together made up with single sheets and single duvets not great for the romantic weekend planned the mousetrap under the bed also wasn t positive ,0
 lift could only take one person and a case carpet in room dirty and loads of stains on it,0
 no service attitude staff not friendly ,0
 very close to london eye and across the bridge from big ben and westminster abbey a small supermarket nearby and starbucks close to waterloo station,1
 very good hotel in the center of paris near the sorbone excellent room good breakfast exclusive design ,1
 everything else ,1
 the location was convenient and the views were amazing ,1
 everything,0
 loved the hotel close to the 02 staff were so friendly and helpful ,1
 extra comfy beds great location and a bar over the skyline which was open until 3 am ,1
 massively over priced poor value for money even the suite was very small terms of the booking were also misleading it said breakfast included but when it came to it only the toast was free the cooked breakfast was extra ,0
 hotel still under construction no lobby no tv or wifi aircon didn t seem to be functioning so room very hot checked out after seeing room promised to email me re refund but still waiting to hear back from them can t get hold of them because they don t even have a telephone number yet hotel should not be open for bookings will expect re imbursement from booking com for lack of due diligence if i don t hear back from them ,0
 1 very bad service 2 bad a c 3 tv channels,0
 rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building pictures are of room 300 the true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly also the bath was lovely and big and inviting great more for couples restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of amsterdam would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too ,1
 this is a noisy overpriced hotel when i arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it when i tried to go to sleep all i could hear were people outside and the television upstairs i requested a move and was given a new room some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine in the morning i could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet ,0
 the charm of this beautiful traditional british hotel situated in a very good area gives to you the perfect vibe of london friendly staff very clean and comfortable bed will definitely come back ,1
 house keeping walked in twice at 9 and 11 am on a sunday morning even though check out time was 12 very bad as we wanted to sleep in if the hotel using opera software the housekeeper must check which rooms are checked out before the walking in on guests mr tom in guest relation were unhelpful as i called to complain and when i came to speak with him he sent another staff member to apologise very lack of customer service i asked some refund cause i payed to sleep till 12 but that was completely ruined and tom told me i was blackmailing him didn t even come out to speak face to face bad bad,0
 everything was bad ,0
 the hotel was shabby very dated,0
 the hotel was in a great location the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was superb would definitely go back to this hotel,1
 unclean 4 starts hotel should be main less 4 ,0
 bad reception staff didn t acknowledge my earlier request for connecting room and the rooms we stayed in are in the old section of the hotel i will never stay in this hotel again further they showed no flexibility in anything we requested don t stay in this hotel,0
 short walk from tube station to hotel very convenient for queens club easy walking distance away,1
 staff very helpful nothing too much trouble i loved the quirky gimmick of the rubber duck ,1
 small room old furniture not clean possibly the dirtiest windows in any hotel in london reception staff useless ,0
 it was clean and comfortable,1
 dirty there where hairs and trash on the floor the heater didn t work the room was next to a shared bathroom and you could hear literally everything the bathroom was worse than a public bathroom the hole hostel had bad smell we had to live right away because it was horrible and they charged us the two night anyway the photos are a lie ,0
 staff not friendly i made a mistake in the booking staff were very rude and no one helped,0
 the location was perfect stones through away from earls court station staff were all lovely and accommodating gardens were lovely cracking thai restaurant round the corner too rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy we didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing ,1
 bed pillows view decor no lift noisy,0
 did not get the type of room that was paid for in advance had to pay an extra 40 on arrival and even then it was still not as it looked in the photos room was not recently refurbished as described did not have a walk in shower as shown in photos room was very very dated stains on walls and carpets tiles damaged wallpaper ripped etc ,0
 the breakfast,1
 the room was an executive room the wall in the bedroom was damp and marked very disappointed as this was my daughters 21st stay in lots of hotels and this was in my opinion definatly like any executive room i have stayed in the hallways near the rooms had peeling paint and looked neglected all though the main areas were very nice,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful my room balcony had a beautiful view of the arc de triumph and the beautiful surrounding leafy streets the hotel is directly opposite a major metro station right near the arc de triumph and champs lys es restaurants and a little supermarket fantastic location ,1
 location was perfect right in the center but near a lovely park and in a quiet neighbourhood one sunny morning we even had croissants with coffee on our little terrace ,1
 let me start by saying i booked months ago and am now 33 weeks pregnant asked specifically for a twin room on either floor when i arrived at the hotel on friday 30th june the reception was frozey the receptionist wouldn t make eye contact no how are you no welcome just can i have your credit card with no explanationation on what for i asked and eventfully she said to take full payment no option to pay with another card just hurry up and hand over the card i paid the amount in full put my card away and then was asked for it again for a 100 security deposit which would be released in 5 working days the lady receptionist literally couldn t care less that i was struggling with bags and having to rumble around for this card i was told we had been upgraded into an apartment with no option to stay in the hotel i booked the hotel wanting a twin room as i am up and down all night and this is not fair on my husband we were lend to this apartment 41 5mins walk down the road apparently no help with bags nothing just running after the porter we get to this apartment with 2 guys sitting on the step smoking and drunk opened the door to be told you have 4 flights of stairs at this point i had enough i said you are joking why can i not be put into the hotel i was told because they had over booked and i had no option porter started to climb the stairs and i said will you help please he tutted and took my bags i struggled with the stairs this is way too much for me personally the apartment was dated smelt of musk and dirty the sofa cushions with covered in a white liquid i dare ask the fridge stunk of old meat the sofa bed had no duvet for my poor husband the shower room had a white mildew in the corner my main bedroom was fine the bed was small but ok the bathroom was dirty again full of hair and marks i called the reception to be told that no management worked the weekend and to email the issues i did this friday no answer as ,0
 too cold no extra blanket extra charges parking is way too expensive ,0
 great location close to many restaurants hyde park and the tube friendly and helpful staff we were upgraded to a club room free ,1
 excellent staff they had a problem with my original booking but moved me to another room which was one of their branches down the street give us free breakfast the next day very kind of them clean and comfortable room good breakfast,1
 we book the hotel over the internet a few days later we visited the 02 and the hotel so i could get my bearings we ask the receptionist about parking i was under the impression that parking was free i was most upset to find that infact we would have to pay a fee of 50 plus but because we were guests we would get a reduced price of 24 wow 330 for a room and then paying for parking car park was empty thank you very much after a wonderful stay in your hotel room food was great service was very slow on the 18th floor cocktail lounge infact after waiting a good ten minutes with out service and no acknowledgement we left we were both looking forward to a cocktail but decided to retire to the bar on the 2nd floor great service from your staff also perhaps if you took away the bar stool away from the cocktail bar area we might have been able to get to the bar to be served regards mr mrs c dobson a return trip i would love at sometime but would have to really think about it ,1
 the room was so pokey it was a joke and for 150 per night it was poor value we were tricked into thinking there were two kingsize beds in the room because of a mirror next to the only bed in the advertising picture not happy at all ,0
 there are many things such as the air conditioning wasn t working properly the baby bed wasn t great and limited finally there was only one concierge and he s barely left the luggage ,0
 hotel is very cheap and not comfortable at all staff is not proffecional,0
 great location friendly staff and comfortable room ,1
 this is the first time i d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last from the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the italian restaurant i could find no faults everyone was very welcoming and friendly by london standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable ,1
 rooms are smelly very small showers have curtains nit comfortable,0
 no water at all on second day electrics faulty in bathroon 518 very noisy you hear lift announcements all the time and people talking all the time doorsbanging bed not made properly and window hard to close so heard fans outside no offers of refund despite problems,0
 amazing location close to everything stuff are ok this hotel has all i needed and more love it ,1
 this is the most terrible hotel i have met ,0
 rooms can do with some tlc and are much smaller than anticipated room 517 was quite warm and the split system would blow warm when placed on cool and cool when placed on warm bathroom ventilation is poor also cleaning staff half heartedly serviced our room on two occasions if you need a taxi do not use the hotels affiliate service they will rip off any unnasuming tourist 20 for a four minute car journey i don t think so ,0
 clostrophobic bed rock hard,0
 celebrating a special birthday they give a free upgrade to a suite and a bottle of bubbly ,1
 cosy and unusual looking hotel great location ,1
 excellent standard on room,1
 location was perfect very close to everything and staff were very friendly hotel itself is well maintained and clean with a lovely bar however when we were there it was very empty ,1
 the breakfast,1
 the room service food was terrible but costly the soup was just blended leftovers from the taste and i asked for bread wjith my soup but got pitta with no butter the room service wasn t 24 hours and was just very disappointing the receptionist when i arrived at 11 30am was quite abrupt a concierge also opened and walked right into my room with a couple just after i arrived i could have been stark naked ,0
 melanie was very helpful julian was friendly animated ,1
 because their system errors i paid third times fees automatically the redound hasn t arrived till now it was my wife s birthday they even did not say a sorry,0
 the cost was way too high for the facility ,0
 i booked on internet your hotel and expect a 4 star hotel my room was in a dependance awfull no hot water dirty shower the english breakfast was very poor ,0
 we had a very unpleasant stay and we believe the experiences we had is unacceptable to everyone not only us we booked two rooms for three nights check in on 19th feb 2016 check out on 22nd feb 2016 on second day when we back to hotel at night we found the bin bag with the rubbish inside were on the desk especially on top of the fruits we leave in the plate how terrible we think we are quite lucky because of the cleaner took this mistake by forgeting take the bin bag away when she change it to a new one otherwise we will eat the fruits this is the very serious hygiene issue to make us risen the complain but there are few other issues we found in three days eg dirty mop left for two days on the table of my friends room cups leave on the table without cleaning no one looks after the canteen downstairs and leave the kitchen unlocked and with the food inside when we raise the issues to the front desk manager he has no sense about how serious it is he keep explain to us he will ask the cleaning lady why she forgot take the bin bag away after she change it and we need to explain to him we will accept this mistake if she only forget the bin bag in the room but we cannot accept she leave it on the table it doesn t really matter whether there has fruits or not and we did request to see the hotel manager but she refused to see us only ask us to send her a email and we did see her sit in the office when the front desk manager spoken to her the conclusion are 1 the hotel has very serious hygiene issues as well as healthy and safety issues 2 the hotel management is weak and not helpful 3 best western group doesn t have basic training management and monitoring system in place not a reliable chained brand hotel at all we are not going to stay in any of the best western hotel at all in the future ,0
 the staff were great very helpful ,1
 very small room tv did not work staff was trying to fix on their own without success so we would appreciate expert tv man to do the job wifi went on and off pretty weak just basic hotel not much facilities not much to do just hotel for overnight stay so price is high we would not rate 4 star hotel ,0
 i was taken by surprise by the style and choice of bars seating areas and activities for children apple macs ,1
 staff was not overly attentive rooms were exceptionally small and the shower screen did not adequately protect the bathroom floor ,0
 good location polite staff good facilities,1
 comfy bed and lovely old world decor,1
 everything ,1
 the smell and the area it was located in,0
 it is a very nice hotel had a quiet room as per my request i chose it for proximity to kings cross station and it was within easy walking distance ,1
 fantastic room upgrade for hubbies birthday a surprise bottle of red wine from the staff with a card personal touch brilliant,1
 the staff were lovely and helpful and the reception area looked impressive on arrival throughout the hotel the decor classy the room was lovely and quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable good location with easy reach to train station tube and restaurants ,1
 it was a big disapointment i booked a 4 star hotel vie booking com but sleept in kitchen smelly room the room was terribly and strongly smelling like spicy food cooked kitchen and plus it wad extremely small unfortunately i lost my trust to booking com ,0

 didn t feel very secure in the rooms was laying in bed one evening watching television and a male who did not work at the establishment entered the room realising we was in bed continued to walk back exiting the room view from the room was rail lines and the side of a building over priced for what you was getting almost 20 for a pre made sandwich didn t enjoy it at all paris i feel after going was a huge waste of money eiffel tower is swarmed by beggars gentleman selling tat men that will walk over grab your hand and continue to tie bracelets around your hands without consent when asked what they are doing and how much is this going to cost they said don t worry hakuna matata after saying i have no notes they untied the bracelet and moved to the next couple and taxi bikes that will ride i front of you almost running you down and continue to bug you when ignoring them will shout curses at you in french when walking away rubbish piles stacked metres from the hotel cupboards boxes mattresses tramps cover the streets around the hotel some not very many beautiful buildings the rest is almost like council apartments although france can be beautiful do not go to paris it was pretty much a building site the sky line was filled with cranes and sheet metal fences just wanted to pay leave and come home ,0
 great decor superb ground floor very atmospheric stylish,1
 room is comfortable and very quiet,1
 creaky floors dripping faucets old carpeting narrow corridors uncomfortable bath tubs no showers uncomfortable mattresses creepy breakfast room,0
 the bed the room and cheap sausages for breakfast,0
 outdatd hotel really poor updates rooms looked like they were from the 80s and felt really old,0
 space clean staff ,1
 the rooms were not very clean at least how i expected they charged me double per a room and it showed lack of organisation ,0

 elegant functionality,1
 central location,1

 the room was discuting small and stink,0
 superb location and excellent room,1
 really filthy bathroom really cramped and claustrophobic room with really filthy and smelly shower ,0
 great location and great room,1
 fantastic ,1
 the room was tiny even by paris standards the bathroom was in a cupboard no room at all the shower was minuscule decor was extremely tired and dirty in places lots of mold in the bathroom all english speaking tv was broken and the reception would not apologise or resolve wifi was very very slow sound proofing in the hotel was non existent in general a tiny property in need of a refurbishment really not up to mercure standards ,0
 toilet wasn t working,0
 smelly room awful and extremely noisy didn t get any sleep,0
 everything else the room was dingy the wifi was beyond horrible worst than dial up we re in 2017 no internet should be that slow ,0
 lovely studio room on upper floor with view of london eye and big ben ,1
 it was a fire trap never return the elevator and hallways and room size were a disgrace they were so small and narrow two people could not walk in the hallway together the pictures on the website were so deceiving breakfast not appealing was in a windowless basement ,0
 nice and clean roomy accommodation i liked the microwave although we didn t need to use it as only there for one night central location handy fridge friendly polite staff ,1
 endless list bed was rock hard sleeping on floor would have been better room temp was far to high constant heating on as it must have been broken told staff and nothing done about it old and outdated,0
 the first room 22016 was old out dated so i asked to be moved i was moved to room 1605 which was a bit better but not a 4 star hotel quality room i tried to use the living well facilities saturday evening about 20 00 pm the customer service at the desk was rude to customers wasn t very helpful has a spanish portuguese or italian accent i stood there for 15 minutes watch 11 people leave the facilities and he was still telling us it was full and it could only accommodate 26 people he was even calling other guests from their rooms to come and use the facilities while we stood there very rude he needs customer service training i had to say to him be nice to your customers or else soon no one will be coming here and you will be out of a job the pool had a whole lot of children in it very noisy not very relaxing at all sauna and steam room not very clean even up to 21 30pm children were in the pool i couldn t use it this is the first hotel i ve been to where there wasn t a cut off time for children in the living well area i don t think this is a 4 star hilton hotel should be down graded ,0
 the deckkor was stunning,1
 car parking charges astronomical room tiny room prices set for lottery winners only empty non working mini bar shower pressure a joke air con not working lifts constantly broken the bath was old repaired and filthy ,0
 when i landed in london i received a call from grande royale hyde park booked via your website they informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating after visiting another hotel paddington hotel which was more distant from the hyde park and looked like it should have 2 3 star rating i went back to the grand royal and demanded the room magically the room was available about 30 smaller in size than the one i booked towels with hair on sorry its far from 4 star disaster ,0
 a poor state of room dirty stained carpets broken furniture a decaying bathroom and door we got a small tv that hardly worked lots of bad signal which resulted in poor tv reception a grotty room on 2nd floor poor view we were very disappointed with the hotel does booking account regional managers actually visit these hotel and rooms a very different experience compared to the website pictures i did not take pictures as this would be very embarrassing to put on the web i did there stay a few times in single rooms so was ok for 1 day night stay but very disappointed in our room for 4 days and added to all costs a rather poor expensive choice of hotel ,0
 the building and location,1
 the room was very very small as well as the bathroom dusty furniture not enough tea coffee milk no biscuits and no hot chocolate continental breakfast was stale and the cereal was just topped up onto old cereal also building work was being carried out and started each morning at 8 30 so the bar restaurant was closed ,0
 very dated hotel rooms are not very nice at all breakfast is terrible food ,0
 location location location quiet room mostly do to double windows bf ok ,1
 really clean comfortable with excellent facilities 2 mins from o2,1
 beautiful entrance lovely little bar warm welcome,1
 rooms are dated for 227 and the room was smelly and dirty upgraded for 66 will rethink on our next stay the price is not worth it ,0
 as above,0
 it has a traditional old hotel feeling the breakfast was great in a lovely room the staff are great and the location is in a safe area easy bus and underground ,1
 location,0
 the breakfast was very good staff were very helpful,1
 dreadful welcome and dreadful room,0
 very rude staff never going back ,0
 it seemed the room was a little small the shower even smaller you could have used the curtain as a flannel and i am of average build the noise of the revellers during the night was ok but got a bit lively and loud during the small hours use the stairs as the lift is very small ,0
 no air conditioning and in basement ,0
 the hotel was comfortable and plush the staff were accommodating and friendly overall an excellent stay ,1
 rooms very noisy decor dated,0
 very clean bed feels good,1
 the location was ideal for anyone visiting the hammersmith apollo within easy walking distance or wishing to explore further afield plenty of places to eat near the hotel we only ate breakfast in the hotel which was plentiful and very good choice of continental or cooked so cannot comment of quality or value of hotel s restaurant for dining,1
 i really liked de location that was the reason i choose it ,1
 there s nothing i can fault i had a wonderful stay and look forward to going back great service welcoming and helpful staff they exceed the standards expected and has to be one of the best i ve ever stayed in ,1
 when arrived for checking in the staff member was very rude with attitude the staff member slammed our room key on the side and we got left to our own devices we also got asked for a 60 deposit which we never got told about until arrival a little later in my partner and i went to the bar to order a few drinks there was three staff members behind the bar but yet it took five minutes for them to actually acknowledge us overall i was disappointed with the stay as it was a surprise getaway for my partners birthday ,0
 this was an email that i sent to their operations manager when he asked what they could improve on as per your request here is a list of the specifics of what your hotel could do to meet the minimum global standards of customer service 1 train your staff to welcome guests every time they walk into the hotel i stayed at your hotel for a week and i was never greeted with a hello good morning bon jour or anything else 2 train your staff to smile there is nothing more universal than the power of it your staff is rude when approached to the point that i wonder if they chose the right career hospitality industry or if they really enjoy their job they felt bothered and inconvenienced when asked a simple question you cannot train your employees to ask guests if they have any questions then get upset when they do 3 when i called the front desk for recommendations for restaurants in the vicinity of the moulin rouge they said that they would have to call me back however they never did 4 train your staff to not knock on guests room door to check on the mini bar when you are naked in the room taking a nap do this when guests are not in the room above all do not open the door and disturb your guests sleep 5 teach your staff the difference between a birthday and an anniversary i received a birthday card as opposed to a happy anniversary card once again your staff knocked on my room door to deliver an incorrect celebratory card while i was taking a nap you can also improve their english language comprehension skills 6 train your maintenance staff that there is nothing wrong with giving guests one extra coffee pod when asked per person staying in the room after spending a week at your hotel the value of one additional coffee pod is insignificant less than 1 euro maybe ,0
 the staff was really really helpful recommended us where to eat how to travel around paris etc we are travelling in a group of 5 people with many large luggages at first we decided to go the cdg airport by rer cos if we take the taxi we would have to take 2 taxis then it will cost a lot but the staff arranged us a minivan taxi to take us all together it was very convenient,1
 the upgrade and welcoming members of staff who greated and treated us to an upgrade on arrival as it was a special occasion for us really did make our stay at the park plaza enjoyable and a happy memory thankyou,1
 walk in shower requested not provided double room booked they tried to give us a twin no heating in the room had to have a space heater they made me sign a form due to my slight disability i am not in wheelchair nor walking sticks in case of fire they would come and knock on my room very very humiliating for me,0
 lovely modern hotel all staff were friendly and helpful bar prices were a little steep but was expected in london breakfast was nice lots of choice and our room was nice bed comfy and a good size would stay here again ,1
 the bed was very comfortable the mobile device for tourists was handy and a nice touch staff were very polite and welcoming ,1
 the rest,0
 this hotel is perhaps a 1 5 star hotel it is misleading and kind of cheating to sell it as a 4 star hotel everthing was shabby in the room with leaking shower door stained bedsheet dirty carpets wobbly chair wardrobe etc ,0
 located across from a mini mart trucks would unload at 3am 5am shower difficult to use staff not approachable would never consider staying here again regardless of any discount plus they took payment 7 months in advance while other hotels have waited for payment closer to the time ,0
 good location big room and bed fantastic architecture of building,1
 the facilities and decoration are so old ,0
 the room was very small it was difficult to walk from one end of the room to the other because there is no room between the end of the bed and the table the cord on the kettle was so short you could not plug it in the electric socket behind the beside table was hanging off the wall the shower was very powerful but the space in the cubicle was non existent and although it was my daughters birthday they did not even wish her happy birthday which is in contrast to the time we stayed in the cumberland hotel in marble arch for my son s 8th birthday where they not only wished him happy birthday but they sent him a platter of fresh fruit with a note wishing him happy birthday all in all a very disappointing experience ,0
 location is middle of no where booking com said it was 0 5mi from the shard which is why i booked turned out to be an hour and half walk or an hour car journey due to traffic the local tube was enough to make anyone not want to travel by tube again hotel prices are ridiculously expensive for the facilities and location if this was more centre london then fair enough but it isn t and made the whole weekend trip more expensive than it needed to be i can t see why there would be any other reason to stay at this hotel ,0
 the elevator was not working for three days had to climb up and down 5 floors unacceptable the bathroom was very dirty,0
 location near earls court underground was great newspapers and tv stations were good view of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room ,1
 the hotel is really lovely room was excellent bed extremely comfy breakfast was very good ideal if going to the 02 as you can walk from the hotel in just a few minutes,1
 every thing,0
 staff not friendly cleaning staff didn t put shower gel coffe milk after first day ,0
 excellent breakfast perfect location for the o2 arena very good quality bed and bedding beautiful swimming pool with robes towels and flip flops ,1
 excellent service and a great location,1
 rooms tiny water only on first day no facilities except the bar central heating not working room on lg where no wifi or phone signal ,0
 textiles design breakfast,1
 no parking facilities bed too hard air conditioning not efficient room decor too mixed up hallway to bedrooms stuffy hot no air vents to be seen anywhere no where to put toiletries in bathroom,0
 from the moment we walked in to the moment we left we couldn t fault the staff hotel or facilities best hotel we have ever stayed at in london will definitely return,1
 rooms were really clean and i am a very fussy person with cleanness but give it 10 10,1
 location people working there were pleasant,1
 needs a good room cleaning wanted to close bar at 10 said you have to order as we are cashing up should not have a bar if they can t accomadate,0
 everything fabulous cant wait till next visit,1
 everything,0
 unprofessionalism untrained staff getting authorisation from my guests s cards without prior notice drinks served in dirty glasses in the restaurant ,0
 i didnt like anything about this hotel complete disappoinent the room the hotel and all the facility was not anything like the information online i tried to book other places despite the fact that i have already paid for the hotel as i was let down badly but unfortunatley it was too late to find any other hotels i dont know how this hotel got 4 star they only deservd 1 star ,0
 beds very small double bed is a 3 4 size astro turf lift dodgy exceptionally hot one minute then cold rooms not as described booked deluxe double exceptionally small very noisy no soundproofing cupboard very high and i am 6ft4 hotel describes itself as boutique most definitely not bathroom was filthy we had to clean before use cleaning cupboard was nearby fruit left in room was rotten ,0

 i wanted to to surprise my wife for our anniversary cause she liked so much hotel when she saw it on the internet and then nothing was the same terrible,0
 don t stay here to expensive and really run down the bedroom was discusting and we had poo in our toilet walls and carpets are dirty says view of eiffel tower and all you see is the top of old buildings breakfast was average the hyatt in germany was much nicer ,0
 small room unable to get anything to eat ,0
 we had the most basic room which was great value as well as spacious and comfortable,1
 i booked the hotel through booking com 5 days before i was due to arrive the hotel took the first nights money out of my bank account staff were not really that friendly ,0
 it was an amazing experience would def come back ,1
 very comfortable bed extremely helpful staff having a morning swim and sauna was a great bonus plenty of choices at the breakfast buffet ,1
 the first room we were put in was in the basement it was awful so they put us on floor 4 the room was so small a double bed was squeezed in there and the bathroom was tiny it was not clean the bed base had dirty marks on it and the room was so hot there was a fan but it was very noisy so you could not have it on at night we had a lovely view of the grenfell tower the breakfast was just awful and the staff serving were lazy and gossiping with their friends there was rubbish on the floor the whole time we were sat there and they just walked over it i paid cash on arrival and when i checked out the next morning they said i hadn t paid the manager came out and informed them that i had paid and showed him the cash in the draw do not stay here its awful ,0
 excellent quality hotel friendly staff great location lovely facilities overall great hotel would definately stay here again ,1
 room dirty beds uncomfortable room noisy air con didn t work generally shabby,0
 helpful and friendly staff nice open lobby space ,1
 the service was really poor it was london marathon weekend and the hotel was completely unprepared for the volume of people had to wait hours to get seated at the restaurant then another hour for our food which was ice cold the whole building is in need of a revamp very expensive weekend for a terrible experience i have stayed in many hotels in my life and never gave a bad review ever before the fact that i am now just underlines how terrible the experience really was from everyone i would never recommend this hotel to anyone in fact i have already warned so many to never stay there a shame really as it is in a perfect location it does need a completely new management system really as we could see that the culture of the hotel is one where they do not care well not on the weekend we were there ,0
 good location in paris with outstandig service,1
 the location the decor friendly staff and overall cleanliness ,1
 bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows we stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful ,1
 the hotel was charming and we would stay there again excellent location and the staff was always helpful ,1
 the total package location service staff and facilities,1
 excellent hotel lovely and strategic location nicely decorated and has the facilities one could ask for staff are extremely helpful and attentive ,1
 everything was grooty and unkept,0
 everything specially the reception staff was very rude and not respectable ,0
 location to o2 meet and greet at the entrance to hotel was exceptional the gentleman made us extremely welcome which was lovely ,1
 the hotel was soo noisy strange sounds in the room and the hotel dose not know the source of this sounds i couldn t sleep because of this noises the service was too slow and bad,0
 our room was situated in the basement our view consisted of the swimming pool which had a kids club saturday morning meaning we couldn t open our curtains for the duration of the stay also we were awoken by the said kids swimming class as the only thing separating us from the pool was a single piece of glass very very noisy after all this stress we couldn t even go swimming because the pool was occupied by the swimming class for the entirety of the monring the location of the hotel is poor its not situated in a nice area of london and it is not central at all took us an exhausting 40 minutes tube and a cab just to reach the hotel after being in central london the surrounding area consist of kabab shops halal meat vendors and iceland ,0
 location,1
 each member of staff we met were lovely very helpful and accommodating our visit to their beauty rooms was very enjoyable and we were very well looked after ,1
 the hotel is very impressive beautiful timber work large inviting reception area and dining room bar is quirky beautiful to look at inside ,1
 we stayed 5 nights booked a winter garden view room with bathtub arranged to the 1st floor which view was kind of dark and dusty at least not as shown on the photos no door for bathroom so makes room humid after shower also showerhands was weak hard to being able to take a good bath after long walk the facility varies from room breakfast was a bummer what matters is the service when i ask staff if there s any kettle or maybe the cleaner forgot the welcoming water the first day they provided the answers were always nop we don t have nop you have to buy it costs 9 euro so are u taking or not i don t think a hotel deserves a 4 star without warm hearts and trying to solving customers needs and provide alternatives my recommendation is that it s no necessary to be equipped for every room but be prepared for some needs that s what good hotel should do not sure if i was being picky because of this is my honeymoon at least this hotel has rooms for improvement ,0
 loved location polite staff nice and central to explore london nice breakfast to start the day will be staying here again,1
 rooms are really nicely dexorated and comfortable breakfasts is really nice,1
 the style of the hotel was quite grand and the christmas decorations were lovely and festive the location was perfect for my needs and there are lots of shops and cafes very nearby for e g breakfast or lunch with pubs and restaurants close too or very short walk away for even more choice i was in a single room that was well suited size wise the layout of the room is well considered and the most is made of the space ,1
 the room is old and no other amenities in the bathroom except shampoo and shower gel no compliment water even we asked for the tea bags and snacks were not provided on every day basis ,0
 so close to kensington palace gardens,1
 the hotel staff were friendly professional and really hospitable it made my son s and my stay at the hotel excellent we were treated very well ,1
 smell of smoke that came through ventilation system at the smokers floor,0
 can extend late check out up till 6pm by paying 10 pounds per hour,1
 bathroom was dirty with ladies hairs on the floor room and bathroom freezing even though heating was on noisy due to outside ventilator speak to the manager but was wasting my time,0
 people are not trained to run and manage a hospitality business,0
 there is no privacy at all the cleaners keeps entering the room while i was sleeping making conversations with me while am in my bed the receptionist keeps calling very early in the morning for selly reasons the place is not clean ive been to london more than 40 times this hotel is the worst hotel ive ever been to i would definitely recommend it for some that i hate to mess with his vacation,0
 the room was too small and very noisy plus they gave us the room for disabled people the women at the reception was annoyed for some reason like she didn t want to talk to us,0
 staff were harassed poorly trained and grumpy with only one notable exception i asked for a strong coffee in the morning this was refused twice and when i asked again if it may be possible to have a stronger coffee the coffee served was the colour of weak tea the waitress brought me a sachet of nescafe and told me i could tip it into the cup the evening receptionist was too busy slamming down telephones and was extremely harassed and angry when i arrived the morning receptionist made up for it by being very understanding and arranging for a refund for my breakfast ,0
 limited amount of hot water tacky decor old finishes pictures are deceiving in the website,0
 everything else was ok ,1
 compact room advertised as deluxe far from it smell of sewerage all night noise from road including bin men arriving at 4 30am refurbishment going on yet no one mentions this compact bathroom nowhere to get dried after show shower beyond small ,0
 reception was sloppy and tired key cards didn t work room had rubbish in it rubbish not cleared by house keeping lumpy bed ripped duvet cover complimentary water in some rooms but not others elevator is the slowest elevator on the planet this is a 3 star hotel but far from 4,0
 everything,0
 room had stains on her walls window didn t open or have handle,0
 check in took 25 minutes this is not a 4 star hotel carpets were ripped and stained in the corridors and there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the corridor outside our room we were told we had been upgraded for free and yet the view from our bedroom window was a wall and a gutter ,0
 rooms are too small toilets where not cleaned properly central ac was not working efficiently paid almost 100 euros paid because of brand name for double room its not worthwise ,0
 beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete we didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel especially the hall to our room ,1
 no air conditioning room size,0
 the location was perfect for the o2 and the bed was amazingly comfortable ,1
 eggs sausages bacon etc everything was undercooked for breakfast no tea coffee in room shower was poor staff were rude and not helpful parking was terrible overpriced and rubbish premier inn would have been 10 times better ,0
 basically every things was bad i already paid for non refundable reservation from 27 july to 4 of august around 900 kwd however i will never show up and live the bad experience in this hotel again bad location bad tinny rooms bathrooms person can t go inside the bathroom either to keep the door open or to negotiatate with the door to go inside and close it a lot of stains on the carpet although the room booked with breakfast however this will not include cooked items as you will be charged with extra price the lift was out of services all the time hotel gust need to carry their luggage to the upper floor without any assistant from hotel staff i can t imagin that they let a leady with her young daughter to carry their larg bags to their rooms in a very unsafe wood stairs without any help from people in the front desk,0
 the location of this place is superb close to subway and hyde park the interior is very 20 s 30 s i love it ,1
 the service,0
 nothing,0
 room was small poorly designed and pretty much every fixture and fitting was broken chipped sink tv hanging off the wall window didn t work window fittings held in by old tape shower made a horrendous noise when turned on very poor ,0
 great value handy location pleasant and helpful staff reasonably priced room service,1
 unhelpful staff had better rooms for a lot less money in london travel lodge give a better facility generally ,0

 the staff is very rude and not flexible at all such a pity,0
 nothing,0
 proximity to west end,1
 this hotel is an absolute no go not only are the rooms incomprehensibly small for a 4 hotel but at 8 in the morning we were awoken by construction work strong high pitch drilling noise not on 1 side of the room but on 2 sides it was such a strong drilling noise that i recorded it i can make it available to whomever wants it impossible to sleep to work or basically to stay in the room i called the reception and the guy there told me in a very impolite way that it wasn t his fault and when told that it was not correct to rent such a room he answered that he wasn t supposed to know about the construction work and that i could complain to whomever i wanted it wouldn t change the problem after investigation quickly it appeared that it wasn t the first day of the said construction work so they basically rented the room to us knowingly at a high rate ,0
 the rooms were lovely and the staff were helpful,1
 we stayed at the novotel because we was attending an event at olympia this hotel is in the perfect place easy to get to from the train and a 5 minute walk to olympia there is a huge selection of places to eat on the high street if you choose not to eat in the hotel we had breakfast included with our stay which was lovel and the beds are so comfy would highly reccomend this hotel ,1
 from check in to concierge keeping our bags bar staff comfy beds this hotel was perfect fantastic location right by the southbank we come once a year with the kids and will stay here again ,1
 excellent visit to london ,1
 i loved the location but my room was in the basement so i had a bad view of the bins wish i had been told i wouod get a nicer view in a different room bathrooms were clean and showers hot which was awesome ,1
 room temprature and layout view from room,0
 beds excellent staff very accommodating theo randall excellent room always cleaned,1
 the majority of the staff needed to smile and realise that they are paid to serve and look after their customers chairs and tables for breakfast were dirty pool sauna were ridiculously small scrambled egg at breakfast was dry beyond all belief room was too small for 2 people we spent 4 nights falling over our suitcases i had to laugh when my husband asked for an ironing board it filled the room painting decorating including sanding happening right outside our bedroom at 8am paint smell noisy cleaners around the same time i think that s all,0
 simply amazing ,1
 do not stay here unless you want to know what sleeping in a coffin is like with really unhelpful hotel management the hotel was in a unfinished state when we arrived with unfinished paint work and dust sheets and with notices to watch your clothes for wet paint there were no signs to help you allocate your room so we ended up going down a wrong corridor i don t recall seeing any fire exit signs or emergency lighting to help you find the way back out either which i thought was actually illegal they appear to be in a rush to take as much money as possible regardless of standard health and safety requirements to their guests the deluxe double room we were given was basically a padded coffin it was so small that it was impossible to close the door when my husband and i entered the room due to us being in the way there were no windows to this coffin and the only access to the bed was an opening of about 60cm so unlucky for you if you re the one unfortunate to be sleeping furthest away we both felt instantly claustrophobic we told reception it was way too small and that a room with windows was at least the very minimum one would expect for a expensive deluxe we were offered an identical room of the same microscopic size next to this one which was still being cleaned but with 1 window the housemaid showed us another room that she said was free but we needed to check with reception which was a small but normal room by normal i mean you could actually get to the bed we told reception the second room they offered it was still too small for us they refused to offer us the bigger room and basically blamed us for not looking at the pictures of their hotel prior to booking which i had and they were nothing like the room we were given ,0
 nightmare clima was not working even they did not announce this in my room was 40 they make construction works during stay lift was not working dust everywhere my worst accomodation in last 25 years ,0
 the size of the room,1
 loved the place very nice rooms friendly staff and great location i especially liked the decor downstairs felt like a step back in time ,1
 pleased with the complimentary breakfasts probably should be included for the price ,1
 very nice hotel located in a park ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center not typical for amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings but pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,1
 this place was a dream particularly liked the tassimo machine in the room best nights sleep i think i ve had in a hotel little touches here and there gave it the luxury feel ,1
 shabby room which has not seen investment in years generally tired and faded furniture and fittings carpets well worn this hotel needs a refurbishment badly reception staff off hand no payment receipt available and one is required to pay on arrival not on departure perhaps because nobody was at reception in the morning it just reflects how capital and operating costs are run at a bare minimum will not return ,0
 speed at check in,1
 location is perfect stuff friendly and helpful good breakfast ,1
 stall were all very friendly and couldn t do enough to please excellent service all round room was clean and well presented and everything you require was at hand ,1
 reception staff were not very kind and welcoming the internet was very poor and the mobile phone in the room was not functional at all,0
 the hotel was a buildind site woken up by drilling and then by cleaner banging on the wall next door room was tiny nothing like the picture i mean nothing only the same decor thats it ,0
 the rooms wasn t like photos much worse,0
 the really noisy building works which started over the road at 8am in the morning and are going to be there for a long time i mentioned it as i checked out when they asked if everything was ok oh yes the receptionist said we know all about that shame they hadn t bothered to tell me before i booked in ,0
 location staff helpfulness,1

 friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked i didn t try it way better than the usual amsterdam culinary sins,1
 we didn t avail of breakfast or any of the hotel facilities as it was a rushed stay attending an event at the 02 however i give this hotel ten out of ten the staff are very professional helpful and friendly the large room had a beautiful view of the estuary and skyscrapers the king sized bed was so comfortable and the pillows were sublime it was like sleeping in a hug we arrived early 1pm and the staff were exceptionally kind and allowed us to check in early check out is 12pm which is excellent there is a walk way from the hotel to the 02 which closes at 1am i will definitely be returning to this hotel ,1

 racist staff,0
 great location great room great staff,1
 the friendliest staff ever,1
 service in reataurant,0
 wonderfully friendly staff and comfy beds ,1
 lifts out of order wifi patchy and rooms small even though we were supposed to have an executive room dated and tired decor wouldn t stay there again ,0
 large hotel just off the main road in hammersmith hotel has underground parking and it s just 2 mins walk to the tube station great view of central london from my room ,1
 fantastic comfy beds great pillows extra soft stayed in the club lounge great value nothing to much trouble for you excellent customer service would definitely recommend this hotel,1
 the staff members were treating me disgracefully based on appearance i felt discriminated against ,0
 all breakfast tables were all left with dirty plates i had to move them to get empty table the food was not hot nobody appeared to replenish extremely poor also i stayed for a total of 3 nights one on business then a 2nd booking for the weekend no bottle of water for second booking i rang and was told it would have to be paid for people running up and down stairs until 3 30am friday and saturday nights so very little sleep all in all pretty terrible stay,0
 the location is excellent,1
 uncomfortable sloping bed tiny bedroom no toothbrush or toopaste run down feel of the place wallpaper fixtures etc needs renovating a basic travelodge feels newer and cleaner ,0
 the staff we excellent hiral went above and beyond for our birthday easter trip chocolates wine cake an egg hunt we won and then a lovely complimentary drink in the theatre bar it was the loveliest atmosphere,1
 in all my years of travelling and staying at hotels i have never in my life written a review i was so shocked by this stay that i cannot stress enough how awful it was do not stay here fellow travellers in rating itself as a 4 star hotel i think the establishment missed an s in it s title this hotel is much more like a hostel had i known it would be a dump i would ve been happy as my expectations were managed i cannot believe this hotel hasn t gotten away with rating itself as a 4 star hotel my studio flat in london seemed palatial in comparison and having thought i d treat myself to a hotel stay in my city i couldn t run back to my place fast enough their mantra should be we don t do it here we don t offer room service they don t offer room service on weekends did you get that on weekends zero room service instead they shoved a take away flyer under a guest s nose saying they should order take away from a local place and hope they deliver we don t do space the room is equivalent to a private hostel room the bed shoved in one corner with a tiny desk next to it and one window my companion and i literally had to walk out of the room to allow the other in to say the rooms are tiny is an understatement we don t offer hand soap yep no hand soap had to use shower gel to wash my hands in a bathroom the equivalent of a toilet stall we don t care that you have mistaken the tv for a cctv camera the flat screen tv is so small that you miss it the first time i d have taken a tv from the 1980 s rather than strain to see a picture from box that is smaller than most people s laptops we don t operate working lifts yep no lift in a 4 star hotel we had to take the stairs we don t provide deck chairs or towels their basement pool is ok but they only have 2 deck chairs ,0
 poor in all aspects of hotel staffing facilities,0
 the view over the thames and out to canary wharf at night was spectacular we also had the room service and both our meals were lovely and the service was excellent the friendly staff made this hotel ,1
 comfortable bed modern shower amazing views great food we stayed for one night and had dinner and breakfast i think i could live here ,1
 room too small tv didn t work charge for wifi,0
 room very good,1
 in desperate need of making it look attractive paint chips old toilet basin and seat even wash basin looks old worn out paper thin towels very very basic if i knew what i would be getting i would have never booked ,0
 very rude staff upon arrival not greeted they just demanded payment card and id we felt like we were not welcome when we walked in and it was as if she had to go out of her way just to deal with us breakfast was poor bit can t moan too much seeing as it was free rooms tiny but measurement are given in the description 4 poster bed made such a horrendous noise when we got on or off that it made it so we didnt dare move in fear of disturbing other guests with the fees they are charging i m sure they can afford to replace it as that nights sleep was very uncomfortable and disturbed due to it ,0
 tv very bad wifi very slow unless you pay 5 per hour,0
 i had a single room and it was tiny like a wardrobe there was nowhere to hang way thing up and the desk was so close to the end of the bed you could not sit in the chair to use the desk air conditioning was set at 33 decree and could not be made cooler ,0
 the location and a very beautuful building,1
 liked nothing no air con sauna heat rooms no hot water unhelpful staff and to top it all the smallest room with no way yo get into bed other than climbing onto bed no walk space either side and concrete dormer overhanging bed which my head crashed into causing me concussion and whiplash ,0
 horrid plastic room terrible bed camping bed not even a real bed heater made a noise all night even when it wasn t on ,0
 very helpful friendly and efficient staff,1
 pretty much everything,0
 as above,0
 the room was unacceptably tiny there wasn t even space to open the luggage the only window in the room was in the ceiling when we complained the receptionist replied very rudly that this is considered a room with a window in this hotel my advise don t go there ,0
 location,1
 i didn t like being over charged and really didn t like the mouse ,0
 the hotel was scruffy and run down dead plants on the doorstep and pop music playing in the lobby in an edwardian style hotel was really tacky i was in a room facing the inner courtyard with a view of air con pipes and some plastic plants in pots the courtyard was netted against pigeons the net was full of litter the room was dusty the bathroom door handle broken the shower curtain mouldy and the hairdryer cut out every 30 seconds due to overheating staff and guests sitting smoking on the front steps created a really poor impression on arrival the lounge was closed off with plastic hazard tape it was somewhere to lay my head for the night the best i can say is that the sheets were clean ,0
 the fact that after paying 130 for a room they took 170 as a preauthorisation which left me stuck in london as i couldn t afford to get home to manchester i also couldn t afford to pay my bills and they bounced and then the bank charged me they are refusing to give me a refund or pay anything towards the debts they have got me in so spending 1 night in a hotel for 130 has actually turned out to be more around 400 500 which isn t good at all ,0
 clean facilities are good espresso coffee machine in room good size room value for money metro is 8 min walk,1
 i ve stayed in better hostels ,0
 great location most of the staff were lovely it was lovely to have fruit on arrival in the room see other comment,1
 spot on location excellent staff,1
 the ac wasn t effective in the night time i think they used to shut it off in the night time the water pressure in the shower was very poor ,0
 location,1
 the bed and room was comfy the views from the room very good and close to the o2 we arrived without toothbrush and paste which the hotel supplied us with ,1
 friendly staff,1
 very comfortable room in central paris just a short walk away from attractions clean tidy stylish friendly ,1
 the rooms are very small and you can hear every breath if someone walks in the corridor it feels as if they are in your room there is massive constructing going on which we were not told about prior to booking the hallways are filled with workers wifi in the room didn t work there was an xmas party going on until 2am with drunk people running through the hallways and the base and music irritating anyone who wanted to sleep after several requests nothing was done wouldn t recommend staying there,0
 we stay in atwin room 219 it was very small and the heat didnt work very well lock door was brake poor breakfast,0
 elevator doesn t work heating off whilst i requested ro be on cleaning personnel not good left alone with suitcase but still a 4star expensive hotel ,0
 everything was terrible,0
 staff were incredibly helpful,1
 air conditioner out of function we can t sleep 30 c in the room very small room and narrow bed asked to call me a taxi in the morning the receptionist forgot it ,0
 wonderful and friendly staff lovely hotel room with great view daniel one of the managers was really helpful ,1
 fantastic room helpful friendly staff can t fault,1
 first of all bed sheets were not changed a single time in 4 days secondly the coffee mugs that were located in the room itself were also not changed or cleaned since the day 1 to be honest it was my first time when i have had such a low quality customer service in the best western hotel lastly the concierge guy tried to rip us off by forcing to drive with a taxi company suggested by him he wen t even for an extra mile saying that all other taxis will charge us much more than the one offered by him to be more specific he wanted us to pay 60 euros for a cab to the orly airport where as i showed him that uber would charge only 40 euros and a local taxi asked us for 35 euros only long story short he convinced us that the other taxis will force us to pay more than the taxi company of his choice so we were forced to pay 60 euros for a taxi that actually cost 35 40 euros i felt very disappointed in the bratnd value of best western hotels now i will always take my time to consider other hotel chains before applying for a best western hotel p s in one of the days they even forgot to replace the toilet paper we actually had to call them and remind them to bring one roll if that is how best western imagines to treat their customers then i would recommend to downgrade them to a 3 star hotel ,0
 couldn t shower because the hot water was green when it came out of the tap staff not helpful ,0
 shower didn t work properly bed not comfortable really didn t enjoy my stay at all and the price was increased,0
 noise you can people in the next room old bathroom no internet very busy breakfast buffet reception staff not friendly,0
 the hotel was fantastic all the staff were so polite myself and my partner had a lovely time staying at the hotel,1
 room was extremely small the road outside of the hotel was perpetually lined with honking traffic it was so hard for the uber driver to stop and pick passengers up the hotel also does not serve breakfast lastly the hotel does not even have the facilities to store our luggage for 2 nights while we sightsee in paris even though we have booked for the subsequent 5 nights in the deluxe suite in the end the options they gave was 1 ask my pregnant wife to lug the luggage to the train station to store it there 2 find another hotel i cancelled the remaining nights and found a more reputable one that stored our luggage ,0
 the hotel is in a great location staff are really polite and helpful the standard of the hotel is high and the food is excellent i especially like the buffet dinner menu the beds are extremely comfortable ,1
 the room was charming just like the pictures and had a great balcony the location was very central and convenient to trains walking to the marais the louvre ,1
 the friendly knowledgable staff couldn t do enough for us they made us feel so very welcome the room was excellent from the facilities to the cleanliness and the bed was fantastic ,1
 beds very very comfortable,1
 the room had the proportions of a lift shaft,0
 very comfortable bed very close to the o2 arena 5 minutes walk ,1
 breakfast staff that day were very rude to us when we came down and food was poor quality,0
 cleanliness and facilities of the room,1
 very friendly and helpful staff ,1
 our room was a clumsy walk outside across courtyard to get to our room they provide umbrellas if it s raining room was dated bathroom dated tiny tv difficult to see we had a superior room with tiny terrace overlooking rainy courtyard there was nothing about this hotel room that felt special ,0
 there was no hot water either the night of arrival or the next morning i requested a quiet room and it was located behind the lift shaft i had to go to work the following morning very early hours so got little sleep a drawer frontage fell off when i tried to open the drawer ,0
 lovely bathroom good room size,1
 good,1
 nice balcony with a table and chairs in the room ,1
 how this hotel has 4 stars is completely outrageous it is hugely expensive to what you get i had booked a small single room and it was truly small beside the small 80 cm single bed there was less than 80 cm floor space width the bathroom was actually no more than 60x120cm and had i not been a quite petite individual i would literally not been able to get into or turn in the tiny shower good water pressure though ,0
 excellent value for money very cosy and comfortable staff were very helpful very happy with the service provided ,1
 friendly reception staff lovely hotel very clean good location,1
 the two nights we stayed was not so smooth i have to say the slow and broken down once in a while elevation didn t help either but the most annoying thing was we didn t have hot water to take a shower the second night well the first night we have noticed the shower water was luke warm so when i called the front office to let them know the response was they will notify the engineer to our great surprise the second night when we were ready to take a shower there is no hot water at all the answer from the front office was to wait so we waited and waited till midnight and there is still no hot water although when we got up in the morning ready to leave for the airport the hot water is back we choose the rate which includes the continental breakfast yes they have the basic but that s about all in comparsion with most other hotels we have stayed at in europe the rating is poor the hotel is obviousely newly renovated the bed is comfortable we even got an upgraded to a suite but the suite is only slight larger than a small room this doesn t look like a four star hotel to me i would definitely try to book another hotel if i will visit london again for the money we pay this won t be the best choice ,0
 sparkly clean very comfortable beds friendly and courteous staff great location for the o2 bar with pretty night views on 18th floor ,1
 dirty bed had not been changed from previous guests,0
 my stay was fine nothing extraordinary ,1
 upon arrival was upgraded to executive room from standard room as i was apparently guest of the day very nice surprise ,1
 old world decoration very friendly and helpful staff good breakfast good location for central line and hyde park ,1
 the location this hotel is located right next to the underground station you can basicallu hear the announcements in the station the walls are also thin so in addition you can hear every noise in the hotel the staff were rude when we came down for breakfast it was a monday but it was a public holiday so according to their hotel rules breakfast ran for longer the staff were unaware of this i guess and were rude to us due to the noise i woke up everyday with a headache the bed we slept on was two singles put together and there was always an uncomfortable gap in the bed ,0
 great location amazing price ,1
 the staff were extremely helpful and friendly ,1
 good price and location,1
 this is my first time writing a comment on a hotel unfortunately i have been very disappointed of the property the room was so small that i was hardly able to turn the tiny table was taken up by a kettle already and in addition it was extremely noisy and you hear every person walking on the stairs poor value for money ,0
 the room was described as river view and it was construction site and windows so dirty could barely see beds were not fit to sleep in dirty toilet wet bath mat,0
 one of the staff speak like a robot ,0
 noise,0
 hotel is old rooms are rubbish and by far worst breakfast i have ever had ,0
 the little extras in the room such as complimentary snacks water etc slippers and quality toiletries,1
 perfect quiet location in the latin quarter delicious breakfast in the charming cellar great view of the gorgeous old sarbonne university from our huge open window loved the mini fridge and coffee maker in room comfortable beds wonderful shower and helpful and friendly staff so happy with this small clean boutique hotel ,1
 family room was brilliant small kitchenette with microwave 4 x plates bowls cutlery mugs tiny fridge but enough for mlk and a few supplies perfect for making snacks for the children sound proofing excellent ,1
 i really can t believe this hotel is classified as 4 stars a part from the price rooms are so small that you can t open your luggage no wardrobe and you don t have enough air for breathing new windows have been placed over the old ones and in order to open them you have to jump on the bed when i tried to open it to have more air it suddenly fell down and i could have seriously hurt my hands and fingers it was really dangerous ,0
 staff were very professional and polite yet still pleasantly down to earth the room was well laid out and spacious plenty of natural light and room to move about easily bed was very comfortable technology was really easy to use and worked well bars and restaurants were well staffed we were impressed by the ambience and design the mixologist cocktail barman in the 1st floor bar lived up to his namesake the professor,1
 the staff were brilliant and very friendly,1
 helpful friendly and competent staff helped out with my daughters wedding needs very accommodating ,1
 very very small room and not sound proofed room it is not 4 star hotel the bath is not comfortable ,0
 staff was incredible everyone at front desk extremely helpful and friendly they could not do enough each day i returned i felt like i had come home based on research i asked for a high floor with partial view of arc de triumphe i got exactly what i asked for room large especially for a city like paris bright with a balcony that had the view to the arc amenities in room were everything you would hope for large and well lit bath metro a 2 minute walk bus to both airports just across the street ,1
 no internet service in the room no room for any luggage in the room you cannot cancel next day booking if not satisfied ,0
 small room dark overlooking a courtyard bathroom no shelf to put the bag inadequate cleaning problems with wifi in the room,0
 facilities are old and shabby ac was not working well in the room and for two nights technicians could not fix it ,0
 we really enjoyed our stay and the room service was prompt and more than what i was expecting thank you for making my anniversary even more memorable ,1
 rude personnel prostitutes on the floor and even though we made complains about noise we ve been told to change hotel ,0
 location just first class in many ways ,1
 very close to underground very close to shops and restaurants quiet location very nice modern hotel even with a garden breakfast was very good,1
 cleaners are not polite and i stayed for about 4 nights and they never change the bed sheet and never clean my room properly most of the time i found the cleaners just put towls on my lougages and leave it was not that hotel i stayed before ,0
 friendly and helpful staff location in easy walking distance of theatres shops and river hotel was quiet although on a busy street ,1
 poor customer service we spent three nights in an unbearable heat and were never assisted with a repair every time i mentioned something in the front desk i was disregarded asked the manager for a discount and ended up with three cocktail coupons if the quality of the room is imperative for you avoid this hotel ,0
 very small rooms cleanliness prices ,0
 break fast 2 much expensive 18 euro and not that much good car parking 2 much expensive 29 erou while most of paris hotels 20 erou and i didn t like the way of hotel disgen and reception location and the lopy and carring the bagges through the electric stairs to first floor then you can get the elevator to your room stuiped way,0
 being changed twice for the room i booked and not being refunded,0
 nearly everything about my stay,0
 the room was spacious and the bed and pillows were comfy close to the eye westminster bridge all the highlight are a skip and a hop away,1
 on arrival for our 4 day stay there was an issue with room availability this was not a problem as they provided a room at their sister hotel in kensington for the first night we came back the next day to spend the last 3 days of our london visit here the hotel staff could not have been more helpful or nice and i would like to thank pranav one of the managers at the hotel who looked after us during our stay i highly recommend this hotel and i look forward to my next visit here a great location excellent breakfast and a unique theater bar on the ground floor where the great lillie langtry performed have one of the house cocktails on the stage that lillie graced with her presence ,1
 worst customer service i have ever experienced freezing cold bedrooms and staff that were so rude and service level appalling ,0
 a nice modern hotel great location for olympia restaurants were excellent rooms clean modern and comfortable car park a real bonus particularly as it was underground and very secure ,1
 a spacious room loved the bathroom especially the heated floor ,1
 greate location very helpful and ploite staff,1
 excellent service and incredible room we were upgraded to the lilly langtry suite due to a surprise marriage proposal this made our special night even more memorable outstanding service ,1
 the reception attitude was not so friendly was not helpful at all,0
 the room i was in on the 9th floor was extremely hot i e it was 27 degrees celsius when i got in there at 9pm the air conditioning was noisy so was difficult to leave it on when trying to sleep and all in all i had a poor night s sleep there ,0
 old furniture cleanliness not fare i will not rate 4 star hotel,0
 friendly staff excellent location furnishings a bit aged but not below expections ,1
 good breakfast ,1
 rooms not clean hotel needs renovation very old bad staff smelling rooms,0
 when i went to check out there was a fire alarm malfunction which knocked out the computers the sole girl on reception did not have the password for the system no response to her phone calls for help fortunately another staff member came in to work and helped this was 8 15 so there should have been more than one receptionist available for checking out i had to ask them to call me a taxi on their account as i was now going to be late for my meeting which i had planned to walk to when the taxi came he asked me whether i liked the hotel when i told him of my experience he told me that this happened frequently there and he often picked up unhappy guests who had requested a transfer plus my shower was lukewarm there was no loo brush in the bathroom and the coffee was lukewarm too a very poor experience very disappointing ,0
 very nice room,1
 excellent location and comfortable accomodations good value for the money ,1
 we were upgraded with our bedroom otherwise the bedrooms are a bit small breakfast was great staff very friendly there are 2 tube stations in walking distance on different lines ,1
 their dismissive attitude,0
 the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas we were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room this turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room ,0
 very good breakfast and nice staff for service we would love to stay here again if there any chance,1
 dirty toilet in room on arrival like the worst kind of dirty room size was rediculously tiny and i m a small woman had to move the chair away from the desk in order to be able to open the bathroom door wasn t exactly blown away by the customer service ,0
 very comfortable clean room,1
 elevator no room service tiny rooms name on booking com is different than on hotel signs,0
 very convinence location breakfast is perfect with freshly baked bread ,1
 the price went from 130 to 170 because i changed the date by one week when i arrived the price was 175 plus breakfast i was with my wife so didnt want to start a fuss as it was our anniversary the bedroom was cramped the bed was like sleeping on a door the dinning room was far to small for the amount of people staying it was chaotic to be honest i am a seasoned traveller ive only ever stayed in a hotel this poor on one other occasion it felt like a second rate guest house ,0
 leaking water in the bathroom the sink was stuck carpet in the room was dirty wifi didn t work well too few staff for so many guests ,0
 the room is so old with only 3 plugs already 2 taken for tv and kettle we are in 2015 how to do with 2 phones 1 laptop and 1 tablet 1 of the restaurant is supposed to close the kitchen at 9 30pm but at 8 45 they start to tell you to eat quickly and more and more ,0
 i liked being able to control the room temperature and the room was very comfortable ,1
 rooms very small and old not like the photos very bad wifi the value is high comparing to the over all hotel ,0
 location and hotel amentities,1
 very nice clean and big room very nice staff ,1
 wifi breakfast room facilities ,0
 this hotel belongs to the fifties decoration service toilet amenities entrance and lobby very un comfortable for people who can not tolerate noise i was annoyed by the noise coming from a man coughing all night in the next room plus people talking in the street you basically should think of this place as bed and breakfast motel and not a four stars hotel ,0
 the service was excellent and staff extremely friendly,1
 the location is ideal the architecture is stunning the staff are very friendly and welcoming the breakfast is delicious and gives a great deal of choice ,1
 what an absolutely stunning hotel clean modern and excellent staff the room with a double view was stunning the bed was so comfortable could not fault the room or the hotel cant wait to go back ,1
 room was tiny couldnt even walk around the bed fully building work taking place and were not informed pictures on booking com different to how the hotel looks ,0
 inefficient air conditioning in room which led to having to keep the window open overnight very disappointed by the poor state of the carpet not reflecting a 4 star hotel rating at all i have seen far better standards in premier inn and travelodge in the uk both of which set a far higher standard of room cleanliness ,0
 rooms are really tatty and tired looking ,0
 kept awake all night by loud moaning staff ignored my request to move no hot water no soap toilet wouldn t flush ,0
 the 140 pound a night room stunk of smoke was freezing cold and constant noise coming from the heating system which you can t turn off the carpet was dirty and dust everywhere we were unable to sleep so early hours moved to another room with the same problem the last thing you need when you ve had a whole day shopping in london on arrival we knew we d made a bad decision the decor was dated there was people all over the place drinking cans of stella and couldn t get any staff to help us with anything after complaining and requesting a refund as it completely ruined our stay and 140 pound for the service just isn t good enough we were offered a complimentary upgrade for next time we stay we won t be staying ever again and an upgrade costs 20 pound on top of minimum 140 so what are they playing at britannia far from it no one is british in there and i wouldn t ever recommend this to my worst enemy ,0
 size price advertise as an apparent is a hostel no 4 stars,0
 excellent location for the purpose of our trip very convenient to walk around and discover the near by london eye westminster big ben jubilee bridge etc westminster and waterloo tube station are very close by warm and spacious suite ,1
 friendly service good breakfasts close to public transport and parks ,1
 good location nice street front and ground floor interior,1
 i have stayed at the russell before and am pleased to see the refurbishment work continues the staff were all attentive and sought to ensure i was having a pleasant stay ,1
 staff are extremely friendly and obliging aircon in my room didn t work so they immediately arranged a move and upgrade location is brilliant free wifi breakfast was good and convenient a great place to stay ,1
 lovely historical place staff couldn t do enough for us ,1
 room was noisy draft coming in from windows heating did not work only a small radiator tv did not work in bathroom li complained the manager came up but could not fix it he then phoned us to say he had left a message with maintenance and if i wanted he would bring us extra covers that was last we heard wanted to speak to a manager in the morning but no manager there what a set up it put a downer on a fantastic day,0
 comfy bed and great shower,1
 the hotel was an ideal place for our london weekend from entering the hotel to leaving it was perfect ,1
 the room was tiny if you are 6ft or taller you would not be able to fit in the bed and for over 100 a night you would hope for somewhere to put your bag other than on or under the bed the bed was right up against the window which was single glazed and right next to a busy junction meaning i got a very poor nights sleep ,0
 rooms are really small and cramped club rooms are small so no extra space for the extra money you spend there is no club lounge so you pay extra to have soft drinks whilst sat in the reception the windows don t open there is a sign that a us of you try to open them they will not return to being in a closed position you do not get the room you request the air conditioning only blows out cold air the heating element doesn t work so your room gets freezing cold you are asked to pay a pre authorisation amount to which on arrival you are told you will receive it straight back this is rubbish they have reserved two separate amounts of my money one of which they didn t inform me of to which haven t been refunded back to me causing my bank to be overdrawn not onlyhos but they have charged me again for my stay so theoretically i have paid twice now i am complaining they are trying to say that it takes 3 5 working days to get my money released back to me even though they said it would be straight away absolutely terrible experience and can guarantee i will never stay in this hotel or its sister hotels if i return to london ,0
 nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice ,1
 everything it was simply excellent,1
 the attitude of staff very dictatorial the fact that they wanted to hold on to 50 per room on my card for 3 days although i checked in at 11pm and left by 7am the next morning the size of the rooms the lack of an iron and iron board and the disinterestedness in collecting one for me from another room which meant i had to go to work the next day with creased clothes ,0
 everything els,0
 the beds were ridiculously comfortable the double glazed windows french doors were brilliant and to be able to get fresh air into a room is always a great thing ,1
 staff nice hotel clean pleasant lounge location spot on ,1
 convenient for my requirements,1
 the bed was insanely comfy didn t want to move from it the room view was incredible and the actual room was clean all the way from top to bottom great location for going to the o2 amazing stay will definitely be going back there ,1
 you don t get for what you pay,0
 superbly appointed hotel great rooms with all the things a modern traveller would need even usb charging points by the bed finally really comfortable stay and a superb breakfast too,1
 hotel was spotless breakfast was fab something to suit everyone staff were extremely friendly and helpful hotel is excellently located next to the metro,1
 quicker response more understanding more customer service pre arrival,0
 the locatoin was perfect the hotel staff were friendly and helpful the room was very nice all in all a very good place to stay ,1
 the room was very small and with a window facing into the hotel i am pregnant and found the room very stuffy we asked to be moved however we were told we could but too an even smaller room however friends who had come down to surprise my husband for his birthday had a free upgrade ,0
 we have stayed at this hotel with our baby eventhough they have baby cot they don t provide matress when we asked how our baby can sleep at such a hard place without a matress they said we don t have nothing they don t really care about comfort the shower is totally different than what is shown in hotel pictures ,0
 this is tired old hotel has not seen investment in its facilities for decades threadbare beat up furniture hard as nails bed the lifts ask for lower floor and take the stairs greasy spoon breakfast it s a rough and ready hotel and as long as you go there not expecting much it ll be fine for a trip to the o2 but it s a long way from its former glory ,0

 comfy beds quiet room and near to the station,1
 obviously had a very good photographer because the rooms are nothing like the pics my single room was hot and stuffy in december with an ineffective and loud fan in the end i opened the window tiny bed even for a single breakfast buffet had run out when i got there had to wait 15 mins for more dirty stained chairs in the dining room and staff that did the bare minimum and no more there are better hotels in london for the money and i ve stayed in lots of them avoid ,0
 this hotel is a disaster and i will never stay again they made such a mess of charging me and eventually charged me twice and it took a lot of emails to get it reimbursed ,0
 where to start first room i was given had been used wet towel on bed water on floor in bathroom handsoap opened and left lying about spoke to front desk who said they will upgrade my room and to leave my luggage as they will move it new room didn t seem any different to first one and had been delivered someone else s bags not mine having to explain that those bags need putting back to the room they came from and mine bringing to me i felt it was hard to relax with such big mistakes being made and promises of upgrades not followed through at check out i found the guy rude and unhelpful i have left the hotel relieved i was only staying 1 night but totally unrelaxed and tired i would unlikely willingly stay in this place again photos show the wet towel found on my bed and the bathroom wet and used at my check in ,0

 1 the room had a bad smell like the carpet was wet and did not dry properly and the room could not be changed as hotel was fully booked 2 i order an extra large bed which i expected to come in a bigger room 3 breakfast was not enjoyable eggs were bitty pancakes were hard and tasted doughy the only good thing i had on that menu was the green tea and orange juice 4 the fact that my partner had to witness a person throw up at the bar area was unacceptable 5 no free parking and the cost off the parking on the street was ridiculous right now i am currently looking for a hotel for this weekend coming as well and if i was happy mercure could have had my business,0
 typical london hotel in historical building friendly staff good location value for money pictures of the hotel on web site are real ,1
 excellent rooms and it is either a new hotel or recently refurbished we only had the basic room which was very comfortable with a very good en suite great location only 10 mins walk to trafalgar square lunch was very good but only ate at hotel once staff very helpful and pleasant lovely courtyard at the back of the hotel which was lovely in the spring sunshine you would not have known that it is located in the centre of london good gym as well which i didn t use tube station only 5 minutes walk away and hotel surrounded by good restaurants and bars ,1
 comfortable mattress,1
 the room was quite dirty an uncomfortable bed air conditioning very noisy etc ,0
 cramped room with cheap old furniture bed definitely not a superior room ,0
 location is superb for visiting the city contemporary hotel design was good breakfast was good we had a very good meal in the evening,1

 it was great we were at a concert at the o2 so was perfect,1
 see above comments ,0
 room appears clean but smelly bad odour in corridors as well breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out the area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy could not wait to get out of that place ,0
 good sized rooms staff friendly and very helpful ,1
 hotel location was perfect especially with direct access into the o2 arena the mature front doorman was a credit to the hotel went out of his way to ensure we were dropped to the local tube station in style ,1

 great family room duplex appt very good staff fantastic tv s in the room on both levels ,1
 small rooms for the price cramped and not easy to move around in refreshment fridge was broken and not told for many hours but promised complimentary items which were never fulfilled room had many defects and loose fittings and fixtures,0
 uncomfortable bed no service on phone no wifi could be located parking rediculous boyfriend had to sit in my car for an hour to stop getting a ticket as maximum parking was 4 hours permits should be offered my hotel room was able to be accessed by the window from the outside food absolutely awful worst nights sleep would never return here feel robbed,0
 nobody offered me help with my luggage on arrival nor on my departure so i had to struggle all alone with my heavy suitcases not once was i offered any assistance from the staff very poor service the bathroom was awful the shower over the bath is very old fashioned i ordered a club sandwich from room service which wasn t good at all the lettuce was wilted and brown and the turkey was unevenly cut the fries were good but then again those were probably pre cut and frozen i stayed for 3 nights each night my room was made up differently i strongly believe that a hotel should have consistencey the bed should be made in the same way every time and the pillows fluffed to perfection ,0
 the hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ,1
 the hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of london so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit we didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep there was very little traffic noise either it was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards the novello is a about 10 minutes walk away i loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home the room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean a bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries ,1
 location was great room was surprisingly spacious staff were helpful ,1
 very small room low ceilings and can hear people talking in all of the adjacent rooms room itself was terrible with tiny windown very dark room,0
 good location,1
 very friendly staff extra warm welcome while checking in felt like you were expected there anytime breakfast had a wide variety tasty the room was cleaned every day it had a romantic setting when we arrived ,1

 the location,0
 breakfast was really good ,1
 everything do not stay at this hotel i have never had an issue with a hotel before let alone made a complaint or left a negative review but after my atrocious hotel experience at villa beaumarchais i feel it s absolutely necessary to inform other potential guests i came back to my room after housekeeping had visited to find my perfume broken and placed back on the side table with the cap on to cover up the damage the damage to the nozzle was irreparable upset as the perfume was a gift and this has never happened to me before i immediately informed the staff at reception and was told that the manager would contact me to arrange compensation for the bottle the manager was incredibly difficult to contact and appeared to be avoiding my repeated requests to talk with her i had to follow up numerous times over the course of several days before sending two emails and calling the head of the hotel group i was told that the manager would telephone me by 5pm she never did finally the manager emailed me to say that the housekeeper had found the bottle lying on the floor unsurprisingly denied any responsibility for the safety of my belongings despite being a hotel isn t that what you pay for and refused to compensate me for my loss i am absolutely appalled by the way the staff and manager handled my situation the staff were rude dismissive and unsympathetic not only this but the carpet in the room was wet when we arrived and the wifi worked intermittently i was woken by a baby crying in a nearby room at 3am several nights and we had to pay to print a boarding pass at reception our room was small cluttered and uncomfortable i repeatedly came back to the hotel rooms to find my belongings moved around despite specifically asking reception to kindly ask housekeeping not to we had to pay extra to use an iron and there was no complimentary water or tea coffee facilities ,0
 excellent location can t fault the room everything very clean and very friendly staff enjoyable stay in london,1
 the location was great near the main attractions but nice and quite the staff was more than helpful ,1
 really good cutomer service underwater pool music,1
 we arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room they then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day it then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room the bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what i can only describe as orange zest all over it this was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out we left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again it really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely but at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back ,0
 nice staff clean room,1
 hotel very old and price quite expensive,0
 i liked the location of the hotel easy access to underground and railway services the staff is very friendly and helpful ,1
 not clean dirty room and bathroom,0
 sleepless night before we got another room very noisy one can hear guests on the floor above when they snore take shower walk etc i wanted to leave the hotel after 1st night tiny room twin after we put bags into the room we couldnt walk in the room anymore basic breakfast breakfast room looked like in a hostel not a 4 stars hotel low quality food door to kitchen were open all the times when i asked to close as i was seating next to the kitchen they disagreeed so i spent breakfast in aromas of washing liquid and noise of dishes being washed staff not really helpful when asked to complete towels missing in our bathroom they ignored it unsecure space to leave thebaggage and you have to carry it yourself as a whole compensation for a sleepless night we got chocolate two stars would be my most rating i dont recomend this hotel conparing to other 4 star boutique hotels i gave been to this is really much below the expected quality,0
 the size of the room,1
 old hotel that needs renovation small rooms with low ceiling completely inadequate comfort level to price small single bed the view from the window towards patio with construction work i could also hear the people staying in the neighbouring room at all times ,0
 location,1
 clean room friendly staff nice area ,1

 the staff were excellent all of them were extremely polite and very helpful the bar had a great atmosphere and was a lovely place to spend an evening the food was good too the location was ideal a short and easy tube journey into central london ,1
 terrible customer service prior to the booking tried cancelling booking due to excepetional personal reasons received zero help and then no repsonse at all poor value for money massively over priced room stuffy claustrophobic cramped and small bathroom inpersonal hard to breathe in mornings due to whatever setting the aircon is using no window to open design of room terrible like being in a space capsule with florescent lighting awful rude unaccomdating staff who fail to realise that youre a guest of the hotel youre not there for them they should be there for you espeically at the prices we are paying would look into other options as there are plenty would never stay at a citizenm hotel again ,0
 location and value for money,1
 rooms are tired and could do with redecoration i stayed in an executive room the shower was antiquated the tap at the bathroom sink malfunctioned and caused a mini flood the room was much too hot and after waiting 20 minutes to check in i was given a non smoking room after requesting a smoking room in advance ,0
 everything grubby hotel with stains on carpets and walls cracked bathroom tiles stained sink broken furniture not at all the standard i was expecting from the mercure chain very disappointing renovation is urgently needed ,0
 be aware room with no windows this was not stated anywhere small variery of breakfast food bathroom would need some refreshing black marks between the tiles shower hose damaged toilet seat damaged faling off noisy corridor in the morning very thin walls as compared to the same brand in belgium this was very big disappointment would never say it was 4 star hotel not gonna book again ,0
 just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court where to start from the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start the hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to covent garden and for location alone is great value i had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner it s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the london eye the apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans pringles and of course the apex duck we had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay they really have thought about everything we have stayed in many hotels in london but would definately choose apex again ,1
 nearly everything else their pictures tell one story the reality tells another,0
 staffs are nice and communication is good great location ,1
 location and staff ,1
 very nice people and very helpful,1
 a very small room,0
 a very comfortable bed,1
 old tired rooms basic bar area very noisy in the morning got an un asked for early morning call and the receptionist laughed while apologising very expensive for such a basic room ,0
 it is a very clean hotel with large comfortable rooms and super housekeeping and room service staff when i speak at author events i want the anonymity of a large generic hotel i feel it gives me the space to prepare they let me stay an extra hour in the room to take some pain medication for a headache which was very kind ,1
 very basic facilities in a cramped room we over looked the rear and had black net curtains ,0
 lovely room the lily langtry suite,1
 no hot water reported light in bathroom broken 3 times never fixed,0
 room was too small even can t move freely in it,0
 for the price of 239 pounds the room was not good no dressing table a stand in bath shower this is nit what i would call a deluxe room my bedroom at home in cape town is much better dreadful couldn t wait to get of hotel and prices of everything was ridiculous would not recommend this hotel we are now in gran canaria in a radisson which is out of this world wonder,0
 everything,0
 the rroms are really small the beds are tiny ,1
 carpets filthy room so tiny we couldn t even sneezed no cold water on the tap and shower breakfast really down to basics air conditioner not working in the room i didn t mind about having only spanish people around us staff customers as i understand but it might be disturbing ,0
 the rooms are very very small even for two people also the carpets were stained old and the entire hotel building in general was in bad shape ,0
 wifi doesn t work tv remote doesn t work room is the size of a rabbit hutch,0
 smell of rooms,0
 staff were helpful and friendly the rooms were very accommodating ,1
 stuff members are so racist you can see i was ignored by them many times trust me you do not want to see them,0
 reception staff need to be trained more housekeeping services are annoying in the morning with lots of noise in the corridor ,0
 location arcitecture,1
 reception at arrival was very poor disappointing lift very small even to lift a stroller no staff to help in luggage specially we had a 10 months baby ,0
 loud creaking noise from the ceiling above that kept us awake all night tv remote didn t work either ,0
 fab upgraded room good varied breakfast pleasant and helpful staff,1
 we booked this through a third party booking com previously to that i had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday they also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion the lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party if you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price how ever i decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves i had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise on arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over when entering the junior suite room i was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room i unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise i had been let down we then went down to reception and spoke with the manager sophia and explained our concerns of the room sophia said i can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week i explained i wish i had been told this before how ever sophia said i will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is kensington park grande she spoke to reservations to find out and sort out thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare i then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick we went down to reception and finally the gm natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us ,0
 nicely furnished,1
 welcoming and helpful front desk staff spacious king size bed and balcony room good central location,1
 the outstanding service,1
 clean rooms helpful staff great location pretty court yard ,1
 location is good subway and bus depot nearby ,1
 the bed was comfy ,1
 paint in the room was peeling dirty marks on the walls and floor bed was uncomfortable didn t feel like a 4 star room the shower didn t have any pressure coming out of it we asked for an iron it got delivered to us but didn t work also it didn t state it would play music until midnight and we heard it loud and clear so couldn t sleep well ,0
 the room was small it had no view the staff room was next door and was constantly noisy the staff were rude it was dirty,0
 spacious comfortable and breakfast was varied and filling ,1
 the staff were really helpful and when i asked for a change of room the staff did this instantly and i have a much better room in the basement section ,1
 stayed before but my last stay topped that breakfast was delicious the room was beautiful and the bed was the comfiest i would have happily paid double of what i paid for my stay ,1
 the customer service standard of accommodation quality of design and fixtures staff were excellent cannot wait to come back breakfast was excellent selection at breakfast was very good our room 349 was stunning ,1
 very comfortable beds excellent breakfast,1
 ideal location for us excellent staff attentive and professional ,1
 tiny room small bad and rude staff,0
 bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to the hotel was warm and beautifully decorated we were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice,1
 to simplify it is a 3 star hotel at best we will not be using the hilton group again,0
 we were a party of ten adults booked for a special friends birthday the staff upgraded the birthday girl s room and had it decorated with balloons and banners that friends had mailed down this made a very special birthday a very memorable weekend staff at the hotel were very obliging and couldn t do enough for us all ,1
 the bed was very comfy and when we arrived we got a few extras in our room as it was my boyfriends birthday ,1
 the receptionist julia was very helpful,1
 near train station easy to find many kind of restaurant,1
 the extra bed comfy ,1
 the hotel location was great close to a metro station which allowed us to travel around paris with ease ,1
 noisy expensive,0
 old furniture and very expensive first time i comed to this hotel and last time sorry for that but we should believe that thankyou,0
 beautiful hotel,1
 the room had a continuous water leak with a resulting powerful mold odor could not get this fixed or moved to a different room hotel fully booked it was extremely expensive given the very poor accommodations ,0
 although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding the hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space i was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside fantastic value for money but i assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in amsterdam the bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite the hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue i would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes ,1
 very comfortable and the staff were all great ,1
 some of the staff is not fluent in english but they do try to be professional ,0
 price phone wasn t working staff was rigid but polite,0
 the view from our room was lovely the breakfast was very tasty with plenty of choices and the easy location with the tube ride into leicester square just one stop away superb ,1
 nice room but view of the station roof ,1
 we were unpleasantly refused to do the early check in although we were really to pay more and we arrived at 11h in the morning which marked the very poor service quality the communication with the hotel was really unpleasant the receptionist was not at all attentive and we have to wait for hours sitting in the hall after 13 hours flight la qualit de service tait tr s mauvaise le r ceptionniste n tait pas du tout attentif on nous a refus brutalement d tre enregistr s un peu plus t t alors m me qu on tait pr ts payer plus on est arriv 11h du matin on a d attendre plusieurs heures dans le hall apr s un vol de 13h bref a a t une exp rience vraiment d sagr able ,0
 it was very old fashioned with brown carpets and everywhere needed to be painted the net curtains in the bedroom looked dirty for the price i paid and the number of stars i was expecting a lot better the rooms were very small and the bathrooms were tiny breakfast tasted good but the dining room wasn t great not much room and very dark ,0
 bathroom needed maintenance,0
 location and cleanliness ,1
 i was over charged in the restaurant items had been added to my bill the response i had from the stafe and manager was unbilivabe inadequate i had wine in my room that had been open by some else during check in my credit card details had been duplicated over 3500 had been eligaly withdrown i spend over 50 night a year in hotels and this was a 1 out of 10 ,0
 the room provided was damp and smelled musty the carpet was beyond worn and looked filthy i did not witness renovations to these accommodations as stated by the property manager online from a may post ,0
 fantastic location stunning rooms and staff that couldn t do enough for you,1
 the breakfast,1
 the manager of the front disk and most of the front disk they are unprofessional at all i benn in this hotel 6 times but i never seen like this trip in this hotel or any hotel in the world many stories in this hotel i do not recommend any one to go to this hotel until the but professional staff in the front desk if you do not check the bell you end with double what you agree,0
 the room was not as clean as it should have been there was a fan on in the room that made a noise all night unable to find the switch to turn this off ,0
 the bathroom design is extremely unreasonable the basin area is less than 1 meter wide and i could barely brush my teeth comfortably since my elbow would hit on the walls btw i am only 1 65m in size 2 so just imagine how it would feel for guys there is no where to put your toilette in either basin area or in shower the dust bin in bathroom is hard to open and in fact i didn t manage to open it besides the hotel rooms are in the opposite building to where the lobby is located and there is no lift so you will need to climb up to 4 floors via a super narrow staircase ,0
 very dusty small and cramped single room overpriced by any western standards i understand that people will always book a room in bloomsbury for what appears to be a low price compared with the service but at least try to invest on the atmosphere the name and the photos of the ad are really misleading i can only suggest this place as an extreme emergency situation but i really believe even a youth hostel would be more charming and equipped ,0
 external noise from 3am to 530am too loud to sleep either the cross rail work or work on adjacent buildings or bin men reception didn t seem interested we had upgraded room my partner left early due to the lack of sleep i paid for a breakfast upgrade and was assured it applied to in room breakfast the only in room option was continental we parked on the street at a charge of 30 to hotel took on trust that that was a fair rate we could have parked 10 yards away at a charge to euro car parks of 9 60 ,0
 everything was amazing from the welcoming attitude of the staff to the breakfast in bed and the room my best stay in london so far and i m regularly travelling to london for leisure with friends family a fantastic first experience in london for my partner too especially being in the suite with the 4 poster bed even asked for some rose petals and a bottle of prosecco to be in the room on arrival soppy i know and everything was a fantastic surprise for my partner fantastic location right next to the tube station in central london great restaurants and small shops cash point in the neighbouring street and all for an amazing price 100 recommend and would definitely stay again ,1
 location,1
 very good location and also nice common rooms,1
 second time we have stayed lovely hotel ,1
 no sleep due to loud air conditioning units outside room and no double glazed windows ,0
 the room was not deluxe the carpet had stains the wifi was needlessly complicated to connect the airconcitioning was noisy the mini bar was empty so pointless one of the lights didn t work ,0
 first is really its not a 5 star qualty hotel 5 days most the time we were happy it was the time we leave we were listening everything even so private part of other person from another rooms becouse its an old bulding it was so cold in the room hopefully someone bring us a small warm mashine breakfast was really not good patetos and mushroom wasnt cooked and most important for us that hotel is really far from all the museums and castels what u want to visit they said its good area yes for bussiness man but not for visitors we loose so much time in the tube everyday even we couldnt see all the museums we planed only things we were a bit happy it was staff they are helpfull and understanding but this do not help to the hotel to make it good f u are ok to have 3 4 star qualty go there but never 5 star had massage it was in the soooo small room i never see before anyway there is many more things we were not satishfate with this hotel but only things i can say that i dont want to go back to this hotel ,0
 poor location dangerous neighborhood can not recommend at all,0
 the room was well equipped and very comfortable room good location for bus stop and tube stations,1
 good location friendly staff small but well appointed rooms,1
 there was a party at floor 1 or 2 over the new years eve by 2 am there were bottles chairs flying around security just sat there and did nothing also why would you a card pre authorization that would last for weeks ,0
 from the moment we arrived to when we left all the staff were helpful and friendly excellent location for eventim apollo will definitely stay again ,1
 room was worn with torn carpet and the linen smelt of smoke value for money was poor,0
 the bed was extremely comfortably and the bath was really deep you could almost swim in it ,1
 smelly dirty bathroom peeling paintwork stains on the wall dirty glass not washed in bathroom not interested in the problems however once we showed reception the photographs they moved us pity they did not notice before they rented out the room ,0
 rooms were not cleaned properly dirty mugs and glasses were left as is or washed off with water leaving it dirty staff did not take responsibility and did not do anything to help will not stay here again and will not recommend either ,0
 good personel and smiling faces ,1
 the hotel is very dated and a bit grubby,0
 beautiful hotel excellent staff eva and when all the facilities are available it will be amazing ,1
 staff were unhelpful and miserable service in restaurant was surly check out no earlier than 8am is ridiculous breakfast no earlier than 8am is also ridiculous,0
 the bed was comfortable the breakfast was superb so much choice ,1
 it was perfect for us to attend a concert at the o2 we didn t even have to step outside as they have a corridor straight into the arena the room was beautiful the beds big and super comfortable we will definitely stay again on our next visit,1
 had a fantastic stay at the grand royale ,1
 there are bugs in the towles and the bed sheet you keep itching all the time the location is a disaster full of drunk people and clubs who shout all the night the elevator is dirty rooms are more then dirty the room service never clean our room they just do the bed staff are so rud they keep the door of the hotel lucked all the time in terms of security and somtimes there is no one there to open the door they let us pay for the mini bar for 5 nights and they didnt told us that its already paid they charge us for city tax and didint told us about it before whats wrong with the housekeeping women is someone forcing them to clean for free they are doing nothing is clening or buying new towles and bed sheets cost you a lot you should close this branch cos its really giving bad image about your name,0
 that the staff weren t honest with me,0
 i dident like because in booking we reserve arrom from pics when i arrive they told me is just a general pics for all room i dident like it was very cold in room the heat dident work also i dident like they take me more money from credit card and like i deal whit booking and when i go they ask me another 9 euro for tax visit but they already take me money when i arrive the staff dont whana understand you,0
 the whole experience to london wouldn t of been the same without this hotel lovely place,1
 everything,0
 service at the reception,0
 service was appalling throughout the stay poor bar service ignored yet overstaffed breakfast service was chaotic and housekeeping asked us to leave an hour before checkout twice ,0

 everything except location,0
 not clean staff are rude self service in the luggages parking is to small it didn t fit my small suv first last time in this miserable place ,0
 awful cleanliness my room was not vacuumed once in 8 days poor bathroom cleanliness,0

 reception staff was very rude,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was excellent,1
 the staff and facilities where amazing and the park was great across the street,1
 i would say that this hotel is like a fake luis vuitton bag it might look from distance the real deal but the closer you look the more it is evident why you pay a cheap price for it everything is done with equipment that looks potentially good but is cheap installed badly and it is terribly poor maintained there were broken things everywhere in our room shower not working bedside lights half hanging electricity sockets that pulls out of the walls end much much more i just gave up in looking around we where in the new built part of the hotel in a superior room the rooms where also not clean enough if compared to any above 3 stars hotel i stayed in just forget about a 5 stars and i do travel a lot and have been to plenty of 4 and 5 stars in my life it is a huge shame because the room with some tlc could be very nice the staff is nice and you could see that they have no much power in what is going on and really not sure what to say rather than apologise spend some money to put it right tight owners of this hotel please ,0
 fantastic location very accommodating staff breakfast buffet generous but overpriced family suite perfect for couple with one or two children liked having kitchenette very clean ,1
 2 mattresses attached together makes the bed uncomfortable dirty bath tub business class is not a proper business class,0
 semen on the bed cover dirty bath room too small had to move the bed to be able to move around better and the carpet beneath was vile overall a fantastic building in a great location let down by poor cleaning and out dated facilities the kettle had insects in it too old ones ,0
 room very tired and dirty smelt of smoke in desperate need of updating,0
 the view excellent,1
 woken up by banging and drilling from work being done next door when the lady came to clean our room she left a big bag of rubbish in our room that wasn t ours on the morning of check out house keeping wanted to clean our room at 10 15am check out not till 12noon ,0
 bed and mattress replacement long overdue,0
 a clean and modern bedroom a nice bar and excellent helpful staff great location very near tube stations,1
 no free wifi in room no bf included staff not very helping or fair no kettle for tea coffee no room heater or was not working it just has the name of hilton and not that standard people who booked room on the spot got very good prices and offers than me who booked two weeks ago ,0
 not clean shower went hot and cold at random air conditioner not working staff surly and a bit stand off,0
 very good value for single night for a single person,1
 great location clean friendly staff was offered an upgrade to the penthouse floor on arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful ,1
 reasonable price for 1 nights stay for a couple in london room was very big which included a sofa and tv which was nice the hotel was an excellent walking distance from the restaurants and apollo theatre ,1
 we stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of the easter break and the grand royale hotel was in a good location it was easy to jump on the tube line and buses which were a few minutes away we stayed in a club room which was comfortable and clean ,1
 bluetooth speaker in the room size of room ,1
 the hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry we also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right the customer service was superb during our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital the customer service here was first class and i would highly recommend it i can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us i would defo stay here again ,1
 hotel was beautiful room was very large and fully equipt,1
 the room was not upto standard carpets stained and the walls room door would not lock radiator was not working and lose we only got told the radiator was not working till after we complained as well as the door told to put the chain on we raised our concerns health and safety as the radiator could come off to be told its acceptable thermostat not working set on one temperature hairs all over the bed that was not mine partners i asked to change rooms which they did at no extra cost the new room was alot better but still hairs on the bed so had to shake it off went out for a meal and heard a conversation with another guest with the house keeper saying they had no room service that day it did not give us a good impression of the hotel will not be going back to this hotel ,0
 the receptionist was very unpleasant i paid for my breakfast in a room but it never arrived instead i was almost thrown out of the room by staff as was taking 10 min too long at the check out rooms are tiny and they don t look like on pictures ,0
 the rooms were smaller than expected barely fitting for two people the bathrooms even smaller when we arrived the room looked like it hasn t been cleaned for days the carpet was stained room service barely did any vacuuming they only made the bed and that is all definitely not value for money please spend your money elsewhere with the rates we got which was quite expensive we did not even get breakfast ,0
 wasn t very clean at all finger marks everywhere view from the room was terrible was facing another hotel under construction just a couple of meter s away no bath either,0
 on the website it said 1000 a night deluxe twin room nothing deluxe about it just a normal room and not the same as the pic on the website,0
 um quality was awful no utility was working properly,0
 the images don t go with the room,0
 the location is great and the property is modern clean and comfortable the italian restaurant was fantastic and the wait staff was very attentive the breakfasts were plentiful and delicious the bar at night stayed open late and we had a great time ,1
 the bed linen were disgusting in the first place after day 1 i accidentally spilled orangejuice on my bed in the morning and when i came back in the afternoon they flipped my bed linen and acted like the whole bed was changed overall poor hygiene ,0
 position of hotel sound proofed rooms,1
 the pillows were so comfortable your head just sinks into them the standard of the hotel was fantastic i would recommend it to anyone not just visiting the o2 but visiting london in general ,1
 the staff was very rude except for the manager and the breakfast very poor not say that the room was extremely smalll,0
 a lot of things the service was horrendous i booked for 2 adults 2 children but was not allowed to open a sofa bed even after paying a supplement for a room upgrade because for some reason the room i booked was only for 2 peoples,0
 the staff was extremely rude always late sometimes they never showed up water was cold and they even brought me dirty utinsles i will never ever ever stay in his hotel again ,0
 disappointed in the wifi this is london in 2016 surely the whole hotel especially the rooms should be able to get wifi,0
 no atmosphere poor reception area dining area felt like a school canteen had to queue to be seated at breakfast ,0
 location car park is really easy being underneath the hotel gym is a proper gym ,1
 the room the beds and no lack of spa,0
 4 fallin stars the place needs to be restructured is really smelly,0
 the room is fantasy and my friend and i really like the decoration of this hotel it was a nice trip ,1
 triple room in the underground floor very dark looking like a dungeon the pictures on booking com shows very different above the ground room due to walls ceiling curvature it was not possible to place mirror on normal height so shaving required bending me back during the day of our stay there was no hot water boiler malfunction and the staff started action to fix it only after my call there was no heating december either and the personnel was very well aware of the issue they were using electric heater at the reception desk but they started acting on the issue only when i directly asked them to do so there were no additional blankets in the whole hotel i don t even mention lack of blankets in the room as there was no cabinet in the room to store them or your belongings there is air conditioning mentioned on booking com in my room i was only able to find old fan it was cold so no big issue for me it looks like the universal recipe for a hotel in london take some old place invest in it once then run it for 20 years without any repairs and call for serious amount of money the word palace in hotel s name is just a sad joke ,0
 service was good,1
 the location is absolutely perfect for central london,1
 reasonable price with very clean rooms good stuffs about 10 min walking to harrods super markets restaurants and the transportation are so close very good location ,1
 the location was excellent room accommodated 3 adults very comfortably,1

 beautiful room lovely staff incredible breakfast ,1
 rooms are dusty and dirty as you can see on the picture the carpet of the junior duplex suite has black patches this is not considered 4 star rating at all for rooms like that if you are going to stay in this hotel booked the duplex suite these room would be much more rated as 4 star and worth your money than the other rooms my kids and i fell sick due to the room being extremely dusty they should up kept their rooms if they want to call themselves 4 star hotel very disappointed ,0
 very friendly and professional staff very good breakfast good quality of the food in restaurant simply a very nice stay,1
 grand and historic hotel reasonable prices to stay in the most beautiful old building sitting rooms and bar were just beautiful friendly staff great location in central london quiet away from the hubbub but close to paddington notting hill and choice of two tubes a minute s walk away loved it ,1

 excellent location friendly helpful staff,1
 the staff was exceptionally helpful our stay was much too short ,1
 nice reception staff wide room excelent location good restaurant closed to private car park,1
 upon checkin we were offered a room on the fourth floor as we requested with twin beds and a quiet room when we got to the room we were overcome by the stench of faeces and one double bed even though upon checkin we discussed the twin beds and this was confirmed immediately we went back to reception as we could not bare the smell we were then given a room on the ground floor behind the bar as this was the only one available we did indicate this was going to be incredibly noisy which was the case during the night also the water was cold at checkout we expressed our disappointment to staff especially for the price we paid but there was no goodwill gesture offered i will definitely not be staying here again or recommend to anyone ,0
 we did not eat there the room was very comfortable and on the 6th floor very peacful all the staff were very polite and helpful ,1
 the noise was incredible i could not sleep there were no fewer than eight railway lines underneath the window of my room trains went by every 45 seconds stopping only at 12 30 am i slept from then until 5 30 am when they started up again the receptionist spoke such excrable english i had to communicate in sign language the breakfast was priced at an incredible 40 i got the same meal at a place in trafalgar square for 10 there is no atm machine in the hotel ,0
 the rooms were very small and not very ideal staying with one other person and we were practically on top of one another had to shout out when going from bathroom to bedroom incase someone was behind the door not good tea of coffee making facilities but the room and hotel was very clean and in a great location and good value for money ,1
 location size of room was good staff were very cooperative and friendly very convenient to many attractions and waterloo station microwave and small fridge were welcome,1
 the rest of the hotel is aging breakfast is poor and very bad soundproofing you feel like your neighbors are in your room ,0
 belligerent duty manager who tried to cover up and make excuses for lighting controls in rooms which just didn t work properly the cleanliness of the bathroom hairs in shower splats of something on tiles behind wc the same duty manager who told us lift to basement wasn t working and watched us struggle with baby in pushchair down stairs with two other young children only to be told by waitress there were no issues with lift so we used said lift for return journey an indian themed restaurant where the prices were not cheap but the food was with a chicken korma which didn t look like or taste like anything we had previously eaten in other restaurants and a supposedly madras style lamb which was literally lamb chops not marinated in the sauce but almost cooked separately with sauce then poured over to make the dish awful food but lovely decorated room more to say but running out of will power and not wishing to rant more than already great location though and nice room once cleaned even with dodgey lighting controls and broken safe door with sharp edges ,0
 very overpriced for a basic single room regardless of london prices surrounding area has rubbish everywhere ,0
 have stayed here before and enjoyed the stay but this time we got upgrades to penthouse floor rooms and mine particularly a corner room was spectacular i think it s lob cation right by the south bank is excellent a short walk or tube ride to everything ,1

 stylish rooms,1
 extremely stingy place to stay no air conditioning as stated only switched on during the summer months despite 25 degree spring heat when the small breakfast buffet ran out it was not replaced so there was never any hot food unless you count toast or milk for cereal the rooms are advertised as soundproof but are far from it traffic sirens screaming gangs fighting doors slamming as well as noise from other rooms could be heard all night long the area is extremely intimidating and dangerous inundated with gangs drug addicts and fighting after dark and not much nicer during the day ,0

 scruffy room,0
 comfy rooms nice and cozy ,1
 the apex temple court hotel is a beautiful facility that is very well located in central london you are a few minutes walk from major destinations the staff is extremely friendly very helpful and very knowldegeable rooms are outstanding and the wifi is goodnall throughout the facility i definitely recommend the stay there for both business and leisure ,1

 wifi was not working properly and no mobile signal in the building beds particularly the pillows were extremely uncomfortable the property was being refurbished at the time and the work extremely noisy started at 8am every day not a relaxing or pleasant experience,0
 what i read about the hotel did not translate to the facilities or experience ,0
 awful room with no window and a deafening extractor fan that could not be turned down or off and staff that apparently couldn t care less about it despite saying its a common complaint ,0

 location service and hotel atmosphere amazing gym looked excellent but not used five star checked us in early 11am was fantastic and accommodated us when we were late for breakfast excellent service both times ,1
 every time i stay at this hotel there is always stains on the carpets in the room the decor finishings in the corridors seem only half finished and mdf quality the staff are stand offish and don t seem to care how is this hotel rated 5 star the only thing going for it is the location ,0
 location was ideal for our visit to winter wonderland ,1
 our first night put in a rabbit hutch of a room unable to close door properly because bed was in the way the bathroom door also touched the bed the bathroom was just a small wet room no extractor fan took shower room full of water mirrors frosted over impossible to clear hotel obviously taking advantage of customers using this room outrageous to claim it s a double room 219 ,0

 price,1
 misleading advertising we ve booked a room for 2 adults 2 kids 12 and 7 year old for 4 nights through booking com when we checked in the front office staff informed us there was no room for 4 people it is your fault and booking com as we don t have this option however in booking com we ve specifically asked for hotel options with 2 2 capacity we suggest the kids share the single bedroom it was so outrageous and disrespectful after complaining and discussing we were told they would make an exception by adding one more extra bed as a favour as the booking was wrong both room and bathroom are much worse than you expect from the hotel website very disappointing experience don t recommend this hotel ,0
 noisy all time slamming doors every morning it was really nightmare to me,0
 room a hole for rats,0
 the location is fantastic and the hotel has a lot of personality,1
 location and the beds the best i slept in,1
 the staff are not friendly for what we paid they originally gave us a small room in the attic location on 4th we had to pull our luggage without any help to our room which included stairs the receptionist relocated us to another room and didn t even offer to help with the luggage even when he could see we were struggling they do not offer extras like most hotels such as shaving kits or toothbrush they rarely come to your room to give you something when you ask for it they request you go to reception for it the walls are thin and you can hear people walking around the other floors above you ,0
 perfect location close to so many things and well connected ,1
 booked a superior room for two and had the confirmation for that at arrival they told us the room was not available and offered two single rooms instead we declined so we got what they call standard double the room was minuscule had no heating at all the window that went on an inner courtyard was completely condensed after half an hour we tried to warm up the room with the hairdryer in addition to that the curtain didn t go up at all the overall experience was absolute sub standard in compensation they offered after some discussion a complementary breakfast and a 20 discount i wouldn t come back here anyway and i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anybody from the outside it s really beautiful once passed the doors it s another story ,0
 we stayed here while visiting to see adele at wembley bar was the smallest bar i ve ever seen 15 80 for 2 archers and lemonades with flat lemonade out of a bottle that looked like it had been there for some time paid for an executive room this was far from it half empty bottle of water in wardrobe bathroom smelt of sweat shower looked filthy so was not used don t even start me on the paper thin bed would definitely not stay here again reported issues to receptionist and her reply was oh i ll advise housekeeping disgusting price for what it is ,0
 i loved the location and the room ,1
 good value for money close to the venue we needed and the underground stations good friendly staff clean rooms and very comfy and warm we wanted for nothing,1
 temperature in the room to stuffy bed ok only 1 pillow each television sound didn t work properly bathroom old fashioned not a good selection of toiletries no shower cap room not cleaned first night so no tea coffee milk ,0
 the shower rail came down and hit my wife s head and when i complained stright away to reception all they did was send maintenance 45 min later the only time they responded quickly was when the fire alarm went off in our room due to the steam from the shower it was fairly small room 166 on the first floor and that was only because they thought we were smoking as they rang our room and asked just that,0
 the multinational staff were extremely friendly and helpful,1
 helpfull staff beautiful building ,1
 everything stunning hotel one of the best we ve stayed in views standard of room food pool location everything was spot on thank you it was also our anniversary and the lovely gentleman at reception gave us a free room upgrade to the most beautiful room the staff made our trip even more perfect can t praise them enough thank you thank you thank you ,1

 i would never stay here again we were not able to check in for several hours as the computers were down the lobby was cold and full of very unhappy guests it was january and the heating in the room did not work but the staff did not inform us of this upon check in we requested a room change but were told we could not because of the special booking price a tiny portable heater was provided which made no difference the duvets were paper thin more for summer than winter no chance we would ever be confortable in the cold dreary room we requested to cancel our booking so we could find a more suitable hotel the hotel said we must call booking com they said only the hotel could refund our money i offered a compromise and pay for one night of a two night booking the manager refused so we left the hotel with our bags on a cold rainy day and found a decent place to stay 430 wasted they can keep my money i will keep my dignity ,0

 nice location great indian food clean rooms,1
 1 rooms are smaller than photo 2 bed sheet is not changed 3 blanckets are thick and sweat 4 no tooth brush 5 no tissue paper 6 check out guy wanted to charge us for more not friendly,0
 there were many points that we didn t like as follows 1 the hotel has confirmed that they could arrange not a duplex room to us prior to our arrival but unfortunately we got a duplex room 2 regarding the duplex room there was no mirror and wardrobe on the upper floor whereas the shower was located on the upper deck i e after taking a shower we have to get change downstairs 3 there was no electric socket for the use of hairdryer in the shower room 4 the air conditioner vent was facing the pillows and we have to switch off the air conditioner when we went to bed 5 on our 2nd stay morning there was some muddy water flushing out from the shower head this was ridiculous and at the end we were late for our meeting 6 there was limited choice of the breakfast and the services was bad we ve ordered the salmon bagel and end up getting some bacon besides my husband ordered a boiled egg for each of us and at the end 2 boiled eggs was served for each of us the scramble egg was dry and tasteless 7 my husband felt sick and we asked the reception to call for the sos doctor and replied to us the expected arrival time of the doctor after 15 mins no reply and we have to call back the reception to follow up with them 8 after arriving i was unpacking and my husband was taking a shower on the upper deck of the room we heard someone came in and out of our room freely for a few times downstairs we were flustered locked the door and put the do not disturb sign out immediately all in all i was very surprised that this was claimed to be a 5 stars hotel and extremely disappointed of this hotel there were a lot of rooms for improvement and this is so far the worse hotel that i had ever stayed ,0
 i liked most of the staff and their cheery manner once you broke through their training programmed attitudes as most of therm are from the continent it took them a little while to become accustomed to the australian humour they loosened up and they look better with a smile on their faces an observation not every customer would like that but having been in the customer relations business for 32 years of my working life a friendly smile goes a long way 9 10 for the staff there was one younger female of the front line staff who definitely could do with with a little training in relaxing and that all important smile instead of just doing the business ,1
 on the whole it was excellent,1
 size of the room are too small nothing to compare with the photo,0
 very comfortable bed staff very friendly and professional,1
 paulina from housekeeping made an amazing job cleaning all the room and bathroom truly made me felt home and comfortable bbig thank you to her,1
 very friendly staff extremely clean and well designed room service was great facilities were perfect and the short distance from the o2 arena was so convenient ,1
 really friendly staff that gave excellent service would recommend to anyone who is looking to stay in london ,1
 room and location great,1
 the hotel has clearly seen better times insects were crawling in the bathroom the room smelled moldy the wallpaper was coming of the wall ,0
 the concierge max and doorman serge were extremely helpful in our navigating the city the location is very central facing russell square very close to the british museum and 15 20 walk to piccadilly circus russell square is very nicely landscaped ,1
 spa and skybar,1
 comfortable rooms excellent facilities great location ,1
 staff in reception was very friendly location great next to a park and the tube ,1
 friendly and helpful staff always pleasant smiling and willing to help wherever possible breakfast was excellent good choice of food excellent place for visiting many areas of london o2 arena and victoria theatre we were able to visit many other places on our visit ,1
 inside the hotel is very run down staffed by uninterested clueless spanish staff with a very poor command of english the dining room is located in the basement and is airless and hot the food on offer for breakfast was appalling hot food served barely warm with a broken down hot drinks machine cheapest cereals and sliced bread provided the bedrooms are very spartan and the provision of basic toiletries virtually non existent it seems as though the owners are using this hotel solely as a means to generate revenue without spending a penny on the building or its amenities this is a great shame as it could be an excellent place to stay ,0
 the staff were not very welcoming they don t understand english rude restaurant manager on ground floor went for dinner at 22 30 he stopped using at the bottom of the stairs as we were entering the restaurant to tell us have grazing at the bar he didn t even allow us to enter before telling us that the receptionist was rude at checkout in i ask what time was breakfast and which floor was steam room she responded i told you previously so rude she had a european accent most staff were european even that restaurants manager no courtesy at all they all need customer service training upon entering the room is observed that the bathroom floor was soiled i rang them they send house keeper up who told me it s damaged tile i ask to move to another room however after i had move to the next room went to the steam room upon return the keys could not open the door once again had to take it back to front desk to reprogrammed the hotel has too many high tech with no ambience also high tech that is inadequate television doesn t work properly i was happy it was one night stay i will always use hotel with english speaking staff who are very courteous and professional i paid for a service not to be treated in that manner ,0
 after pulling back my bed covers to get in bed i found dirty male and female underwear under the bed cover there was no toilet roll or shower gel in the bathroom when i complained i was put in a much smaller room until my previous room was cleaned this was then given to another guest as i was forgotten about i feel as though my complaint was just swept under the carpet and no one really cared i will never stay at this hotel again and before anyone books to stay at the best western i d advice you to look at the surrounding area bookings com shows you pictures of surrounding areas near to the eiffel tower which is completely different from where the hotel is actually situated ,0
 your rooms are congested bathroom is terrible the tub is too high room 1807 is not a room were you should have bath tub some day someone will get injured in that type of bathroom our fridge not working we were offered another one but no space to keep it why is the desk so huge the room looks rundown we travel a lot monthly this was my most disappointing room i have ever had,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the shower amazing the location of the hotel was super lots of places to eat and socialise travel back and fro to tourist areas was superb ,1
 location excellent near british museum and piccadilly line and brunswick square ,1
 bad heating old facility very congested breakfast options very limited rooms wee very small,0
 old rooms renovations were taking place and there was no warning before arrival had to use staff lifts which were dirty room was shabby and bed was uncomfortable no air con and bedroom had light shining in from building across the road ,0
 very clean and well equiped rooms very quiet very nice staff well located,1
 good location,1
 the hotel is very old there are different buildings and we were located in the tower building which i can only assume was the oldest of them all the room smelled awful and the bathroom was even worse it was rusty and had this really bad smell in it the beds were not comfortable and there was only one working power outlet in the room there are no lights in the bedroom except for the nightstand lights so it was annoying having to always open those especially during the day since our windows didn t bring in a lot of light because we had the hilton building blocking any light that could come in the air conditioning was also very ancient the room could either be freezing or just too hot they definitively need to renovate and upgrade all the rooms found in the tower building wifi i have stayed at many hotels in my life seldom i find a hotel that charges its customers for wifi especially in a 4 5 star hotel and especially in 2016 what a huge inconvenience when you pay 150euros per night one would expect wifi to be free oh and there is an additional charge for breakfast everything was an extra charge i think hilton can do a lot more when it comes to their customers having a nice stay at ther hotel i was talking about how horrible the rooms were with my friends and some customer staying on the same floor as us were all agreeing with our comments so i know i was not the only one which leads me to conclude that i will not be staying here ever again and will not be recommending this hotel to anyone i know definitively not worth it and i would suggest if others can find a hotel at almost the same price go to that one and stay away from this hilton hotel ,0
 air con is very noisy stayed twice and both times impossible to sleep had to change rooms ,0
 old and dirty room ,0
 very comfortable bed and cool hotel,1
 great location walking distance to theatre and west end,1
 the hotel staff does not have information of the city they do not know the area very junior staff with no experience in dealing with clients they asked for a 100 deposit and gave us a handwritten receipt on a sheet of paper and told us that if we lost the receipt they could not return the deposit it s a shame that they do not invest in more prepared staff ,0
 hotel was beautiful staff were extremely pleasant and helpful at all times,1
 politeness and helpfulness of staff great facilities in room ,1
 at breakfast one usually had to go through quite a few plates to find one which did not have food remains on it our room was cleaned for 3 days in a row and glasses with juice in it were left in the same position we left them each time one day we came back to find our toiletries had been left in the sink after the room was cleaned in general the facilities need to be improved if this is indeed a 4 star hotel otherwise this isn t worth the money,0
 bed super comfy room nice and dark great curtains great breakfast ,1
 breakfast was very good esp since there was soy milk and gluten free cereal kitchenette in room was an added bonus staff very friendly and helpful,1
 location wi fi and staff were great ,1
 excellent choices for breakfast,1

 really nice friendly hotel in london staff helpful ,1
 location historic class food service,1
 the hotel is currently being refurbished the main lifts were out of order so we had to use the service lift beds were stored in the service lift vestibules which smelt and the air conditioning wasn t working making the bedroom uncomfortabley hot ,0
 i have been charged twice by the hotel i paid throw booking com at the first time and it was deducted from my bank account and when i was checking out from the hotel they asked me to pay again though they have received the payment i m not happy with the lady who made my check out arrangements yet i had to leave to the airport,0
 no a c staff were rude especially the ladies in the morning shift they wanted to charge me for extra money for a 30 minutes late checkout rooms were too small ,0
 the locatation the are area is not was not safe very small room ,0
 the condition of our room the smell in our room the cave like conditions of the wifi,0
 i had to leave a day earlier after a stay of 7 days yet the hotel to my surprise insisted to charge me the extra night cheap move very small size room had to pay extra to get a standard size room for a couple small size cabinet limited breakfast selection,0
 the room it s so small and and carpet in the room very dirty and there no fridge in the room and there no service in hotel no one carry our luggage during check in and check out this hotel it s should be rated for 2 star not 4,0
 when i arrived at 1130pm i was told i had been booked into their sister hotel and when i complained they then gave me a room in the hotel but someone had been smoking in it so i had no choice but to complain i was the told they would order me a taxi to the sister hotel so i waited for five minutes but then i was offered a room just off the lobby which was fine although noisy because of its proximity to the lobby ,0
 was a lovely hotel very warm welcome on arrival and staff were very helpful would definitely go back,1
 it s a very old building ac wasn t good there a dusty smell in the place lighting was very poor sounds all the time comes from other rooms so i couldn t sleep that well the sun was inside the room as the curtains was i think at least 30 years old staff is not that polite very expensive rooms are tiny i could move around it wifi was weak i was unable to do any of my work ,0
 carpet and wall dirty curtain hanging off old chipped funiture one old bath robe for two noisey external hotel generators only view was of internal walls and generators expensive ,0
 perfect location extremely friendly and helpful staff,1
 the breakfast buffet had a great selection and the room was nice and clean,1
 very friendly staff,1
 the darkness of the hotel the noise the cooking inn the restaurant the beds and rooms need updating the rudeness of the managers as if they didn t care and the rudeness of the waitress anna cuzon in the restaurant once we d w money for the bill we re busy now she said can you move i will never again stay at the hillton ,0
 the smallest room i ever saw in my life not clean have to call and remind during the day couple times to make up the room everyday 2 out of 10,0
 everything about our stay was fantastic from being greeted at the door super friendly staff to the slippers and bathrobes in the room wouldn t hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying again in fact we are already planning our next london trip ,1
 great location friendly staff,1
 the staff were very helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble the breakfast was very good loved the theatre bar ,1
 breakfast staff,1
 better training for staff as they were not welcoming and too busy with their tasks better maintenance for the building one of the lifts was frequently broken the shower water pump mad a loud noise had towels with holes in it need a lot of improvement to be 5 star it was very very poor,0
 staff were incredibly polite and willing to help at all times hotel is in a very good location and facilities are brilliant,1
 the bathroom was a mess the pillows were bad the bed was tough like a brick my access card demagnetized 3 times in 2 days the elevators were overpopulated and the stairs are alarmed only to be used in case of fire ,0
 had a lovely time spent at the hotel got to check in early and when i went to check we were told that we had been selected as guest of the day and got a free upgrade on the room and breakfast in the morning really made the stay a pleasure,1
 2 star hotel poor stuff poor english they speak with sir but they don t know nothing they can inform u about nothing properly the single deluxe room is a shame 2 2 m and 1 90 height the bed 1 75 my feet didn t match bed the shower is way to small no services not very clean very very poor hotel amd has nothing to do with the stars and for these to pay these money is really embarassing you feel like an idiot after ,0
 hotel is smelly and unclean,0
 they said they upgraded our room but it s still very small the room doesn t even have enough space to place two open suitcases the room is only good for one person to stay they didn t clean the carpet there are cookies on it and they forgot to give us towels and water bottles when we call the front desk they were not helpful they ask us to write a memo to their hotel manager or write it online and this is exactly what i m doing right now ,0
 the hotel needs to update the windows facilities furniture the hotel was dirty and we need to contact the staff to have the towels ,0
 very good resturant close to london eye and big ben very comfort with smart tv,1
 the rooms are too small the bathroom tub needs better cleaning ,0
 the location was the worst it s the last metro stop can t walk the lane alone after 12 at night very unsafe area why does the hotel even have a bathroom it s a 1 1 ft bath area being 6 ft tall could hardly stand under the shower,0
 was met at the entrance and escorted to the checking in desk our bags were taken up to our rooms excellent service all round will certainly be staying again ,1
 room cleaning chaotic and on new years day non existent did not like being told this fact was on notice board it wasn t shows the lack of management endemic to the hotel ,0
 room was very stuffy and impossible to have fresh air because windows do not open we also complained to the receptionist about this issue and he did nothing about it ,0
 just about everything,0
 the onsite restaurants especially belga were great waiters were attentive and food was fab shower pressure was ace ,1
 fantastic location and the staff were friendly and helpful,1
 location exellent room has big space comfort bed nice nespresso in the room would recommend this place,1
 bed is so bad and not comfortable,0
 amazing hotel especially if you need a place to stay after a concert in the o2 very convenient facilities are amazing there is even a dedicated entrance to the o2 from the hotel ,1
 good sleep quality beds sound proofing excellent for good nights sleep city view ok but as quite a distance not worth paying extra for car parked for us on arrival one night charge 35 euro which was very convenient the hotel was spotless staff courteous the location great we had dinner in bercy village a short stroll away where there was an abundance of restaurants with sitting in outside a great atmosphere on a saturday night overall would recommend stay again ,1
 location staff perfect,1
 to all weary travellers i booked a four night stay at the park grand hotel in london paddington having just arrived from a long journey and i checked into my room and went straight to bed not long after drifting off to the land of nod i awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms upon further inspection i soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders i counted in the double digits after contacting reception i was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation by this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump the manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway the following morning i spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit the manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which i did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways at one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that i may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury this certainly did put me at ease and i did not feel like a valued customer instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay i requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights as anticipated i was told that i should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so i had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel i short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful ,0
 we booked a superior double room for 3 nights and got a downstairs one with no daylight and a smelly rug in the second evening when we got back from town and my girlfriend fell down the stairs in the room i asked to change rooms but the hotel was fully booked only in the third night we got the room we paid for which was very nice ,0
 the hotel has a lot to do to meet parisian hotel standards it wasn t pleasant at all waking in the early morning every day because of the staff making too much noise and the fact that it was easy to hear everything that was going on the floor due their thin doors after 2 days in the hotel you just give up using the elevator and all the other guests too i don t know why but their elevator is extremely slow and one day it took 10 minutes to get to my floor the spa is not operational when i went down to use the sauna it was turned off the staff couldnt help me until one recepcionist told me that i had to let them know 1 hour before so i told them i would like to use it in 1 hour after a while they told me it wasn t working another issue was with the check out we had 3 rooms and wanted to stay until 18h or pay for another day to stay until later the hotel was almost fully booked and they told me that they would be able to provide 1 room until that time i asked them which one and they told me to choose between room 14 or 24 i chose 14 after a while he calls me and tells me that only 24 is available the whole hotel needs to be reshaped i ll never going back to this one and dont recomend it at all ,0
 staff at check in were the most friendly helpful staff i think i have ever encountered couldn t do enough for me the room was beautifully clean and modern ,1
 had amazing service free upgrade and when my husbands flight delay nearly interfered with our trip they allowed an early check for free and tried their best help faultless service ,1
 very helpful staff all premises were kept really clean a very good breakfast and you can eat all you can the garden at the bakc of the building really nice if the weather is good ,1
 room was dated and in need of attention poor dated hairdryer stuck on wall and lack of movement why move with the times even gym has better facilities in changing rooms breakfast was horrible seating far too big for tables and made movement for self service difficult breakfast was yuk again cheap produce cooked badly now i know why the europeans hate our food come on we have great quality food in the uk use it ,0
 reception was uninformative there is no lift and i was up 4 flights or more of stairs carpets were in a poor state and were not nice to walk on no slippers provided the bed sagged and was not comfortable i didn t eat breakfast so couldn t comment ,0
 proximity to st pancras kings cross tube stations comfortable rooms and good hotel,1
 great location comfortable small rooms descent though slightly over priced breakfast ,1
 the location was amazing steps from everything you need and wants staff was friendly and mostly helpful ,1
 room not clean bad smell in the bathroom as the time rude staff corridors in the basement had a bad smell aswell,0
 the staff were lovely and very helpful room was a good size and the paid parking on site was reasonable ,1
 absolutely everything top quality hotel clean stunning architecture friendly courteous polite accommodating staff excellent service rooms breakfast with plenty of choice dining staff friendly and helpful few minutes to underground trains ace hotel anyone persevering where to go wont be disappointed at this hotel ,1
 perfect location for sight seeing excellent modern hotel with great amenities state of the art rooms and wonderful views ,1
 the staff was bad and no corporate with me ,0
 the staff were very welcoming and within five minutes of us being in our room we got a call to ask if we were happy with everything we got an early check in and late check out really lovely details in the room pool and spa both outstanding nothing to complain about at all and 5 minute walk to the 02 a real gem hidden out of site the bar was fabulous and we got a window seat looking out across the river and city views would stay here again would be a first choice ,1
 this hotel is obviously focused on the downstairs bar and roof terrace bar not staying guests as a result of the bar the reception is squeezed in the hallway anyone off the street going to the roof bar can access the room areas and as we found out set off fire alarms at midnight hallways are very dark including breakfast area when you want it bright and airy no breakfast in room option no cooked breakfast and a condescending message as to why not message we are managing you and have decided you ll eat healthy no ventilation in rooms so big smell of damp furniture smelled of wet dogs moved rooms and the same after air freshener had worn off great staff and location but terrible hotel for 255 a night,0
 location was superb,1
 excellent hotel in an excellent location close to bars shops and restaurants plus tube station was only a couple of minutes away ,1
 stay was wonderful staffs were friendly enjoyed the yummy breakfast especially the scrambled eggs loved the room and we got upgraded to a bigger room would definitely come back ,1
 tired hotel breakfast wasn t very good ,0
 we had an amazing view of canary wharf most staff were polite and helpful as it was a birthday they upgraded us to deluxe ,1
 its not even 2 stars hotel,0
 bathtub was old and narrow walkways low floor and not nice view,0
 courteous staff and convenient location,1
 hotel and room very clean and well maintained staff very helpful and pleasant staff very service oriented very convenient location,1
 i had lunch one day the restaurant was very quiet and the menu was limited perhaps these things are related ,0
 excellent location great staff the suite was perfect ,1
 breakfast was excellent location perfect to get anywhere in london beds were a little hard as were the pillows and the towel rack was very difficult to put towel back as i am short and it was tucked up in bathroom niche,1
 lovely cool decor very well laid out bedroom with lots of space and exceptionally comfy bed beautiful clean bathroom with quality toiletries,1
 everything family room booked for 4 and 1 double bed son slept on the floor and took payment out of my bank twice,0
 priorities are wrong the customer is not valued it is a dysfunctional administration ,0
 paid extra for upgrade however wasn t worth it at all lack of communication between staff poor customer care even when we mentioned our issues at the time of our stay ,0
 very convenient for the 02 with a 3 minute walkway beautiful comfy bed nice large room the view from the sky bar was amazing,1
 excellent staff high quality room and furnishings and a good breakfast ,1
 the whole atmosphere of the wonderful hotel,1
 not being able to sleep through the in house night club dreadful noise till just before 4am the staff just don t care and wokenus to deliver luggage that wasn t even ours at 730am and again at 1130 having had no sleep wouldn t stay here again for free they just don t give a damn,0
 cleanliness efficiency and ease of location comparatively quiet to other hotels i ve stayed at in london too ,1
 the first room i was offered was shockingly outdated and shabby and looked dirty there were very few facilities in the general areas small drinks menu only very bad red or white wine or champagne the carpet in the bedroom needs throwing out sticky underfoot ,0
 on the other hand if you take out the location factor this hotel is not even qualified to be called as 2 star for some reason this was a 4 star hotel maybe the paris standards the breakfast was such a disappointment the rooms were so cramped junior suite was a joke played on us the whole facility looked like sham ,0
 the state of the hotel in general was very poor the windows in the bar were rusty and needed replacing the room was a total state and not updated for decades no doubt the bathroom was disgusting and i could not call down in the morning to order breakfast to my room as the room phone was dead and i did not have time to go and eat due to needing to be out early for a conference i will never stay there again ,0
 this hotel was a surprise from the moment we walked through the door the staff were very friendly and helpful and the theatre bar has to be seen to be believed breakfast was fine and the location near queensway station was excellent for all areas of central london we shall consider this hotel again when looking to stay in london ,1
 location perfect for our needs,1
 beds were comfortable great space for families brilliant location,1
 the room was tiny,0
 everything,0
 for 250gbp my room was in the basement below ground level there was no possibility to open the window to get some fresh air inside and in addition it was a very small room,0
 great location,1
 old and unclean furniture,0
 everything,0
 i found the staff at this hotel to be rather cold and suspicious of the guests they seemed very anxious that we were going to break something or not do something according to their rules no one who worked in the hotel was english all staff seemed to hail from eastern europe they were professional but there was not a sense of a warm welcome and that they would try to accommodate the needs of the guest they made us hand in our keys each time we left the hotel which was a bit concerning regarding privacy and lent itself to the general feeling of they were watching us and suspicious of our behavior one had the impression it was being run by the russian mafia i also had problems with the plumbing it smelled like a sewer on the entire floor and i called it to their attention and they didn t get it fixed rooms carry a lot of noise between and between floors poor sound proofing expensive for this level of service ,0
 dirty when you see the modern hotel in detail very congested and flies around and even hair on my pillow gave me so disgusting feeling never i will stay in any western chain hotels cramped and filthy,0
 location,1
 nice and quiet place and yrt so central location,1
 hotel itself was great location is difficult as the roads are gridlocked nearby,1
 top quality hotel in a great location,1
 bathroom was producing a very bad smell as well as staff was not helping at all breakfast was included and they also charge almost 5 pounds per person as they say u are eligible for continental breakfast only and they provide english breakfast,0
 having paid 349 for one night and was amazed at how bad the room was for the price ,0
 breakfast horrible hugely overpriced,0
 when i woke up i was covers in red spots three days when since i check out and i m still struggling with antistaminucs little animals are the real owners of the little room,0
 staff were lovely and accommodating room was adequate and happy to stay again,1
 dirty room invaded by dust poor daily cleaning 1 elevator serving a lot of people waiting time is crazy the steps of the stairs are less than one foot wide standard which makes it not only uncomfortable but risky ceiling is not sound proof steps of people walking upside are heard very loudly one feels a bomb is explosing doors closing system very noisy and disturbing all night long toothpaste is extra charged no water bottles provided in the room generally the hotel lacks basic structural features ,0
 the service was second to none from the welcome at the door to the team checking you in who also reffered to me by name the following day its the little things also the view on the 18th floor bar incredible ,1
 nice selection for break fast good coffee,1
 we got a room with no air conditioning the maintenance man said the motor needed to be replaced so they moved us to a different room which made us late for an appt the other room they moved us to had air but then during the middle of the night that stopped working also we were incredibly hot but did not ask for another room as that then would be our third room no guarantee that room would be any better my brother sister in law did have a room with air conditioning had no issues,0
 the rooms are tiny tiny and not value for money the standard rooms especially are way too small i also do not like that i am chasing for my deposit that was taken a day earlier than it should have been 5 weeks later i have tried to get it resolved with no luck i would never recommend this hotel or choose to stay here ever again ,0
 service and staff excellent ,1
 everything the staff extremely rude and unhelpful hotel looks like it was built in the 1900 s the lobby looks like a school cafeteria the lifts are inside a door that looks like a refugee camp the hallways are haunted with 0 lights and horrible rooms ,0
 i had to have my room moved as it was so noisy from trains no free wi fi except in lobby charged for swimming pool leisure which was very old tired etc and i didn t feel confident about health risk of sauna or tub as a result,0
 breakfast was good i would have liked fried eggs room was comfortable ,1
 new hotel clean and large rooms,1
 breakfast very good comfy bed near the tube and railway ,1
 this is a very high grade hotel with splendid rooms friendly staff and a good splash of luxury ,1
 room was dated chair was damaged desk had ring marks from glasses carpet was tired with the exception of the concierge and check in staff the staff were surly unhelpful and when i said my milk tasted off with my tea they did not offer any replacement or money back ,0
 a fost cea mai groaznica experien a avuta la un hotel ,0
 poor accommodation and service ,0
 the hotel location lobby room staff were faultless,1
 broken heater in the room hotel fully booked they offered us breakfast to apologies maid service badly organised we ve request to clean our room few hours after check in but no one did our bed was so dirty on the metres cover during breakfast too many people standing around waiting for the table chaos slow service ,0
 reception desk was always helping,1
 reception told me my debit card had been declined with booking com and wanted a credit card instead i refused so they took payment on my debit card which has ample funds that was very disgusting of them for me to be told my card was declined when it was fine room service was appaulingly slow also the room was very small for a double ,0
 room too small,0
 i was sold a superior room with glass partition between the bathroom and bedroom and i didn t get that i wasn t even sure if they gave me the right room can you check for me ,0
 rooms very small even upgraded superior beds uncomfortable breakfast like a six nations rolling maul self service area poorly positioned ,0
 location service cleanliness,1
 the location for the o2 is outstanding the hotel has a real wow factor and the staff are very professional and accommodating the room wonderful service and breakfast were a real treat it made our stay in london very special ,1
 the towels were old and not having a fresh feeling toilets are so small and congested even though the room was clean but didn t give a fresh feeling the breakfast was not up to the standard ,0
 comfy bed room was clean,1
 character and style of the hotel was really nice ,1
 this hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation however given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 we booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds when we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed we told the front desk about this they reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds they also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct we were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back first they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other park hotels when we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this so we had to accept the room anyhow they also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day more interestingly we made the booking in euros and were charged more than 20 euros more than our initial booking without any explanation when we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work the heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet when we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working ok and that we would have to wait to heat up that did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air mid januari in london that is not nice we called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction however they told us not being able to repair it until next day ,0
 we will be back ,1
 location,1
 nothing all bad,0
 the older stye and ambiance the efficient staff ,1
 for one was so close to the o2 room very comfy people were very welcoming the views were lovely especially from the bar at the top ,1
 bathroom was small sink was blocked and the fan didn t work breakfast room was cramped very small without much room at all food was okay but you had to serve yourself and wait for some as it wasn t always ready on the plates so other food got cold on your plate too many people with just one person giving help had to ask three times for some tea three times for a glass to put some juice in and it felt as if you were a problem in all it wasn t worth the money a small over crowded place without room to swing a cat i won t go there again ,0
 the staff was extra polite the acomodations were very comfortable and exceeded our expectations very clean hotel with a bar at the upper floor ,1
 everything,1
 being upgraded to a suite because it was my birthday with a complimentary bottle of wine fantastic breakfast ,1
 the bar and terrace were booked out most evenings for functions and could not be accessed by guests this is the reason i didnt rate facilities better gym could do with additional weight equipmemt,0
 the lighting in the room and bathroom were terrible not enough light to shave or do make up not even enough light to read in bed ,0
 bath didn t run away and i reported it and they didn t mend it so had cold water in the bath the following morning dressing cupboard couldn t open door and see the mirror as door to room fire hinge got in the way no air and window into well so heard all the air conditioning plants for all the other rooms terrible left at 5 00 in the morning as it was so bad ,0
 becareful with this hotel i have stayed there between 29th sep til 2 st october i was with my wife my 5 years old daughter was in turkey so she had high fever then we need to return 1 day ago i have spoken with booking com they have spoken with hotel and they said it need to be 24 in advance then nothing to do my daugter is more important then money so at14 10 i went to loby on 1st of octeber to check out so they said you need to speek with booking com to cancel your stay i call them and they again call hotel and they said this time it is 14 15 so you are 15 minutes late so we charge you full still my daugter is much more important then this hotel payment another issue hotel price was 450 gbp and they authorise 520 gbp which is normal but when i check out they take my credit card and take 450 gbp it looks normal but still my 520 gbp authorisation is not released i talk with hotel and they said it is normal this means i pay 450 gbp and also they authorise 520 gbp i am stil waiting for cancelation ,0
 location,1
 greeted by excellent members of staff both at the front desk and in the restaurant free wifi cleanliness excellent room had really comfy beds tea making facilities and mini fridge the restaurant belgo has a great selection of beers ales wines and cocktails really enjoyed our stay we stayed in a 2 double bed room which had been refurbished nearest tube is russell square you also have kings cross and holborn within 20 minute walk,1
 room was too small they even put a desk and chair in there but not even a child could sit on the chair as there was no space between the desk and the bed ,0
 room was tiny bathroom door couldn t open fully because room was too small for bed sofa bed in there you couldn t think of opening up no room to walk no window load of rubbish executive room in the basement with no window avoid this hotel ,0
 the staff were horrible the room was dirty including the bathroom i complained but i was downgraded to a smaller room no refund ,0
 the room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all there was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night not worth 411 for 3 nights at all and definitely not 4 ,0
 poor service no air conditioning only one dubious lift dirthy environment surley staff and very expensive,0
 excellent location very central to tourist attractions nice ambience very good restaurants next door the room was only 11sq m but each and every inch of it was put to good use ,1
 bed sheets had blood stains all over it and i left the room and was told i was not going to get a refund as i asked for and did not stay in the hotel,0
 breakfast was very good value for money the breakfast staff were excellent ,1
 the hotel is so old the paints are fading wall papers cracked furniture looks like 30 years old and the toilet doors could barely be closed ,0
 room and staff booked and paid for a 4 poster room didn t get a 4 poster room staff couldn t be bothered hotel tired and tatty room grubby with peeling paint and resident cobwebs no view out of the french doors ruined my entire weekend away really disappointed ,0
 location very close to london eye big ben etc ,1
 just by chance i hit upon a hotel with a history it appears to be a small hotel with an amazing story the lower floors have wonderful wood panelling and scultured wood over the doors and stained glass leaded windows the breakfast rooms have beautiful moulded ceilings however my single bedroom was ultra modern apparently edward 7th bought this house for his mistress lilly langtry and had a small theatre and bar installed which are very ornate and intimate the hotel is in an excellent position being near queensway tube station on the bayswater road and right opposite kensington gardens and about 6 minutes walk from the palace it took me 45 minutes to walk through the gardens and across hyde park passing the serpentine and rotten row to reach marble arch ,1
 great location even upgraded my room and offered free breakfast,1
 the reseptionist was very rude and ignorant they have minor capability of communicating properly with the customers there was a cockroach in our room one night and it was extremely disturbing we sensed that the hotel was very dirty for that reason and it was not possible to sleep with calm in the night because of this happening we had to kill the bug and throw it away they have also told us that the rooms are for 3 people but it wasnt true we were 3 and we had to stay in a room with 2 bed one night it was vey bad service as they have said they couldnt do anything because the room was too small to put an extra bed inside the reception and the manager even offered to put an extra bed without a frame just the mattress itself on the floor we told him that it is not possible and this suggestion is humiliating in the meantime ,0
 breakfast location underground restaurants pubs and shops are 5 min by walk ,1
 the hotel was situated exactly where we wanted so an ideal location we didn t use any facilities and it was just a base however the staff were really friendly and professional the hotel was clean ,1
 air con did not work when room was too hot they offered to open the window hot city fumes lovely alternative tired look and feel to the hotel ,0
 comfort in room poor service not worth the money ordered rolls royce to pick us up but the driver couldn t even meet us properly,0
 bad service toilet hand washer not drained warm not cool air condition charging for room service alot of basic things such as teeth brush not available,0
 perhaps the ambience of the front lounge could have been better but the staff was most helpful and obliging ,0
 i have stayed at this hotel a few times now and can never find any major faults with it it has great connections on the tube however is in walking distance to your main shopping areas and sight seeing staff are very friendly and go out of their way to ensure your stay is as you expect it to be the room was spacious and very comfy bed i will stay here again ,1
 the appearance of the reception is a fa ade that deceives the lack of investment in the rest of the hotel the staff are efficient and functional but are clearly not trained in attentive customer service and creating a great experience for every guest,0
 everything was fantastic perfect for going to o2 arena worth every penny ,1
 every time the toilet flushed there was a very loud noise that lasted for 5 mins and was very disturbing especially in the middle of the night when i told reception in the morning there was no interest and not even an apology very unhelpful ,0
 every thing,0
 arrogant staff,0
 first of all we were charged twice for our room booked once while booking second while check in plus you pay 100eur deposit when asked at reception the agent said we will refund your amount which never came through secondly extremely tiny rooms no appropriate place to even keep our luggage for two in a standard room so only fancy pictures don t buy it guys the overall staff of the hotel was rude and dumb especially if you are an international you are screwed because nobody cares to even speak english i know its france but how uneducated and unfriendly third and most common necessity is morning coffee no cafeteria in the hotel to have coffee which is a basic thing found even in the worst rated hotel note you are forced to pay for breakfast to have coffee or either order for room service well talking about it the room service was even more pathetic waited for the coffee like 1 hour and never came the staff especially at reception is highly unpleasant and arrogant overall stay at the hotel for a first visit to paris was highly discomforting and dissatisfying our perception of paris hotels was way different never recommending nor booking this hotel in future negative rating ,0
 pleasant stay great location,1
 staff are very polite and helpful gave us a free upgrade without asking which was nice pretty central and not to far on the tube for attractions like buckingham palace probably about 15 min train ride staff also gave us a late check out without charging us which we was made up with as we wasn t leaving london until 7pm overall good experience,1
 stained floors tiny bathroom poor paint job just looked tired ,0
 room nice and quiet bed really comfy staff friendly ideal location for visiting olympia horse show,1
 great staff comfortable quiet rooms breakfast upstairs was good ,1
 everything was perfect ,1
 moved to another sister hotel due to water leakage problem but driver dropped me at the wrong place room too small reserved for double bed but they gave me one small single bed ,0
 the rooms are very dirty and not well kept needs redecorating and plumbing looking at,0
 excellent breakfast location and staff,1
 the room was extremely shabby a renovation is really necessary 300 pounds paid is really too expensive for this one bedroom suite the elevator just carried 1 person 2 persons overweight ,0
 lifts were appalling massive queue and i ended up squashed in a loft with 9 men and i m a women that was bit awks mattress was really uncomfortable and room was way to hot parking to expensive aswell,0
 i travel to london regularly on business and am pretty relaxed about where i stay this was without doubt the worst hotel i ve ever stayed in i seriously considered moving but couldn t find an alternative on the day the room i was allocated was in a next door building not the actual hotel there wasn t actually standing height around the bed or in the bathroom because of the mezzanine and low ceiling above the mezzanine room the neighbours a private flat i m guessing were very noisy until 2am ,0
 cheap upgrade to studio room lovely staff view from the window ,1
 rooms are too small,0
 very smull rooms very bad rooms richtig schlecht,0
 terrible hotel horrible bed small and cramped bad mattress hot room and super tiny internet did not work well ,0
 fantastic hotel,1
 great staff ,1
 very friendly and efficient staff who always seem to know your name good location for our requirements ,1
 the staff were so friendly we ended up being upgraded for free the hotel was lovely and clean ,1
 5 minutes from paddington underground so getting around was easy,1
 no paper tissue in the room the metallic box was empty asked 2 times for it and they never filled it asked to meet the manager 3 times for a different reason but he would not go out and meet me in all my travelling experience i never incountered such a gross behavior from a hotel manager what manager refuses to meet his guest it is very desappointing ,0
 helpful polite staff spacious immaculate and clean premier executive room comfortable bed dinner in the artisan grill and buffet breakfast both excellent good wifi only a few minutes walk from hammersmith tube ,1
 the design is not as good as i think the furniture design interior design and light design is ok not matching with hotels of the same price the view is ok but facing the main street and has no privacy when sit outside ,0
 calling reception for door key card not working nobody picked the phone even after more than 5 minutes of ringing have to go down personally the new card also have trouble and work after 4 5 try the staff were also non cooperative by not providing extra bed as confirmed during booking have to argue a lot to get the same found another guest shouting on another reception staff ,0
 wonderful hotel great food perfect room it was a perfect vacation,1
 breakfast lovely as usual check in and out very smooth and hassle free ,1
 taking a 60 despot when checking in and paying an 5 50 for breakfast when we had already paid for breakfast ,0
 the noises from the street below makes you feel you are not having any time to relaxe,0
 lovely hotel great staff we have stayed here several times before i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone,1
 friendly staff nothing was too much problem quiet at night,1
 great views of 2 of london landmarks comfortable bed and spacious suite friendly and helpful staff definitely will stay again ,1
 the reception staff were rude our key cards did not seem to be working so we asked for help we were given another set and a patronising teach in on how to use them when these did not seem to work we asked the concierge who finally informed us that we should have been told that the door handle had to be pulled up not down due to safety reasons the reception staff had forgotten to tell us this ,0
 everything the room too small dirty carpet broken wardrobe not a 4 star hotel it should be a 2 star,0
 was given disability room when have no disability bathroom tap was loose and room was small,0
 location,1
 staff were not very friendly bed looked old pricey and patchy wifi,0
 room was dated and had no water on arrival staff appeared overstretched and the problem took a couple of hours to resolve pricey for the standard of room not what you expect from the raddisons group,0
 perfect location lots of grt restaurants nearby and staff can t do enough for you,1
 the friendly staff and bar and resturant nothing was to much trouble excellent all round we will be back ,1
 clean nice stuff good internet good location ,1
 being from australia we wanted a nineteenth century experience in a beautiful authentic olde world hotel it was all that the lily langtry theatre bar was outstandingly beautiful we had many gorgeous cocktails there amid the gilt and finery loved it although single rooms are small they are just enough and very comfortable the deep british bath was fabulous too ,1
 the location was just fab nice and quite and with just a short walk from the park and center also i appreciated that the internet access was for free and that it worked very well,1
 the hotel is not four star,0
 location to london eyes cleanses ,1
 the executive suite we were upgraded to at no extra cost was very spacious comfortable the staff were very helpful friendly ,1
 noise outside we were on level 5,0
 beds were extra comfy staff very friendly and helpful ,1
 service in the whole hotel was fantastic especially ucha and andrea in the peninsula restaurant friendly clean and luxurious hotel comfortable beds and amazing views of the river and canary wharf the sky bar on the 18th floor has stunning views across london everything you could think of and more for breakfast ,1
 air conditioning was none existent i had to wait two hours for room on arrival after check in time ,0
 staff were very rude at reception take money for nothing then take over a week to give back made a few requests that were ignored room cleaning woke us up at 7 am on both mornings shocking view of a brick wall when requested nice view not what you expect for 250 a night ,0
 uncomfortable beds depressing room arrangement colour scheme ,0
 breakfast didn t worth the money very expensive and poor service ,0
 too much noise on the upstairs room i couldn t sleep all night i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
 everything was great except the room is quite small for a couple very difficult to get around the bed the room was very clean and well attended to ,1
 location breakfast and service ,1
 i do not need to explain anymore it was a depressing poor venue,0
 great location good price ,1
 great room and fantastic staff ,1
 there was a wedding on and the noise level could be heard throughout the hotel small rooms windows didn t open had to get ice as hotel does not offer ideal in,0
 nothing really significant and worth mentioning just some minor points which u shared eith the team,0
 only 20min free wifi per day then you have to pay overheated rooms air con not working,0
 the room and surrounding rooms were i slept was no more than outbuildings in a back court yard as there was glass around the two walls i felt unsafe as it on a ground floor it felt stuffy and to say i payed 161 pounds i truly think it was not worth the money very disappointed that day there was no hot water when asked an explanation was given but not mentioned with an apology before hand almost as if one had not noticed the shower was cold ,0
 very confy bed great bar with lovely staff ,1
 rooms too small,0
 enjoyed stay will use again thanks,1
 every things bad old we buy for nothing two time they tack full amount from my card ,0
 stayed here with a mate for a night out in london clean and more spacious rooms than similar hotels i ve used in this area at a similar price point would use again ,1
 very friendly staff lovely hotel great location and views had prepaid so no need to check out at desk which was handy ,1
 best hotel we can ask for the location was absolutely amazing near everything the bad was so comfy pls note that the bath is without door that way i think the room is recommended for couples only we will be back for sure ,1
 definitely not a 4 star hotel triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion except for the reception ladies staff very rude definitely not reccomended being in london in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars ,0
 dirty loud expensive extremely slow service at one point i counted over 30 guests waiting to check in,0
 this could go on for some time this place it appears to be an old converted block of flats from around the 1800 s it has a seriously very narrow central spiral staircase with a lift that was installed at a very much later date and as so does not come to ground floor but appears halfway up a flight of stairs this is the same for all 5 floors elderly people or those with walking problems will find this either considerably difficult to deal with or even dangerous i am not joking to reach this lift i a 72 year old man had to carry my heavy luggage up to this lift on my own as no help was offered or given upon studying this further and reading the emergency escape instructions if the central stairway becomes blocked you are then instructed to remain in your rooms please note this instruction because there are no external fire escapes i suppose it s easier to remove bodies this way rather than cleaning up the outside pavements of those who attempted to jump to safety the rooms themselves are just about big enough to take a full size double bed which then leaves about 18 inches either way for you to get round the shower works quite well though and breakfast is just about passable for a cheap hotel of which this one is not i do not consider this place value for money nor do i recommend it to anyone else i am also writing to booking com to make a formal complaint with regard to their promoting this hotel as it is quite obvious no one appears to have checked this place before advertising it ,0
 nothing else,1
 very comfy bed perfect bathroom ideal room near centre of paris but still quiet and great transport links stunning views ,1
 rooms are too small you cannot have breakfast in the hotel because there are only 2 tables and there is no ac in the breakfast area i never go that hotel again ,0
 very comfortable and the partner package was really value for money,1
 24 hour reception,1
 no hot water for a few hours on a sunday at 9am not exactly what you want when wanting a shower no alternative facilities offered bar closed at 1am,0
 need an overhaul on your menu to cater for vegetarians basically the french are chicken hearted and have no idea of hospitality send your staff to intensive hospitality training courses in dubai ,0
 in the morning when i was supposed to arrive at the hotel i saw a payment on my card s statement toward the hotel for the whole amount of the 2 rooms i booked around 900 euros and not informed about that at the booking s moment once arrived they explained me that they had just freezed the money and that i would have been able to see them in 3 to 5 days and i therefor decided to pay with a different card now what is scandalous is that after 6 working days i still don t see the considerable amount on my card and calling the hotel i just got always the same answer you have to wait few more days well guess what this hotel got in one day 1800 euros for two rooms and i am still waiting to get back my 900 this can t and must not happen ,0
 it s a beautiful hotel or should i say will be when the renovation is finished ,1
 breakfast was amazing fresh and tasty service and food were good for the evening meal and effort was made to right the earlier problems,1
 staff were fantastic brought when bag up to my room the bedroom was beautiful small but just what e wanted the lobby was a beautiful old victorian style that i couldn t keep my eyes off of the hotel was close to restaurants and the tube and just steps for kensington gardens that are beautiful to walk through i would stay there again ,1
 that the rooms was not available at 5pm and they wouldnt allow me to cancel one day even if booing has already arranged it,0
 breakfast was very poor a french hotel and the croissant were packet not even fresh bottled water in the room only for the first day after that you have to pay 10 euro per bottle lifts broke down with people in them seriously not worth it maybe a couple of years ago it was a good hotel service was very poor ,0
 very inflexible on every small request check out time till i told them that i m a gold memeber and this is not really a favor i m asking for changing the dates of my stay though i proposed to pay penalty if needed or buy with higher rate i felt dealing more with an intransigent public administration than a leisure hotel ,0
 the room was not big enough and not adequate for two people there was no room to go around the bed so that i had to get over my partner to reach the bathroom the a c was down so that we have been sweating the whole night bathroom was extremely small there was no minibar i had to purchase 6 x mini bottles of water form reception not to die of thirst 1 3 of a liter each at the cost of gbp 7 5 the safe box was down as well overall a complete disaster i will not recommend the stay at this hotel to anyone i will never go there again ,0
 we stayed in the hotel because of it being in an ideal location for seeing a concert at the o2 area due to being located directly next door definitely recommend with the facilities available ,1
 the whole hotel had an awful smell when you walked in the mini lobby smells like vinegar the old carpets smell bad and our room smelled like puke mixed with baby wipe products the bed was supposed to be for 2 people but i think they measure them for midgets not normal average humans the washroom was so tight when you sit on the toilet you face a wall and your knees touch it the rooms are so tight to each other that you hear everything including the 2 hour sex sessions of your neighbours we also woke up to a fire alarm and people who close their doors next to us wake us up since the walls were paper thin and super close to one another definetly not a 4 star hotel but if you have no other choice in terms of money the area is safe because it s all rich families and old people ,0
 staff rude and food very expensive and i ordered halal and they didn t provide me with that,0
 excellent location 5 min walk to london eye well maintained n properly serviced property staff very helpful ,1
 this hotel was booked as it is advertised as having car parking facility only to arrive and find that the facility is not available and wont be available to guests until after september 2017 this is because they are having renovations done on the property and are concerned that there could been falling debris masonry onto parked cars although there is no restriction on pedestrians in the exact area when questioned are you not concerned about debris falling on people more than on a car that can be repaired there was little response clearly a major health and safety issue as parking was the key factor we did not stay and moved to an hotel across the road ,0
 can t open windows no smoking area very hot in vip small lounge not very good location no sauna or steam room or swimming pool no resturant no garden nothing like hilton at all rooms are not that much either hotel needs lots of improvement and changes value of money 0 ,0
 the bed was very uncomfortable and the road noise was unbearable breakfast was overpriced and average barely slept i will not come back ,0
 great location early check in beautiful rooms,1
 staff was very rude and unprofessional obviously they needed a lot of training the conseirge is the worst not only did he not offer to help but he asked me to move my bags to the storage room and then to the room when we checked in we requested an extra bed with the reservation and confirmed so with them 2 days before my travel when we arrived they informed us that there isn t any available and didn t even return my call when i requested for a solution never again to this hotel,0
 reception staff poor,0
 it wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com the room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room after we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working it took a long time to deal with this in the evening the showers were weak in both rooms one day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed overall too many problems ,0
 staff weren t helpful we paid a lot of money for our room and no information was given to us when checking in they told us no info about breakfast restaurants bars check out time etc very un pleasant at reception the guy just took our money and told us we have to pay 150 deposit on card and if we didn t have card we would have to pay 300 in cash makes no sense to have different amounts cash card we stayed from a friday to monday and we had to ring reception ourselves to find out why our room hadnt been cleaned in two days on the sunday it was awful,0
 staff very helpful good service luggage store available next to russell square tube station inc english breakfast but good cafe available in square opposite ,1
 everything,0
 helpfull staff and little extra touches like box of chocs and bottle of wine ,1
 lack of cleanliness shower tiles had mould basin didn t drain properly ,0
 the room was perfect staff were fantastic very helpful and couldn t do enough for us we forgot to lock our safe one day and nothing was touched would recommend this hotel to everybody,1
 bed really comfy lovely breakfast the sky bar has wonderful views ,1
 this is a hotel run by people who don t know what they are doing sorry but it was that bad the decor is garish and tacky the room a junior suite overlooked the side of the hotel with a glimpse of the river one way if you overlook a dump of building materials and over a builders merchants the other see pictures the first impression wasn t good why did i have to produce photo id when checking in apparently it is company policy the two huge massage chairs which greeted us outside then list on our floor had scrappy out of order signs on them why have them there the room layout was bizarre we had a junior suite so you enter a large hallway where the wardrobes are then turn a corner to find a huge bed occupying most of the space in the bedroom area to get past this and into the rear lounge area you had to contort yourself past the end of the bed whilst avoiding the eye level hazard of the television which was affixed to the wall we didn t bother to use the lounge as it was at the back of the suite with no windows and just a one hideous brocade sofa and a six seat dining table i think the room was design to be the other way round the lounge should have face the windows and the rear part should have been the bedroom presumably the current operators think that guests will prefer to have a view of the building site from the comfort of their bed whilst giving the occupants of the flats opposite an entertaining or otherwise view through straight on to the bed through the floor to ceiling window the bathrooms was huge the jacuzzi bath was good the shower was a complete joke loads of jets at every angle controlled by one tap which was impossible to regulate it was hilarious absolutely impossible to not completely soak the floor whilst trying to work out how to just take a shower the spa was a joke poky scruffy and crowded ,0
 the superior room was very comfortable the location of the hotel along fleet street was a comfortable walking distance to covent garden if you chose not to walk there are buses just outside the hotel that takes you to there or to trafalgar square ,1
 delightful smiling staff high standard of decoration and furnishings very welcoming and comfortable convenient location what s not to like ,1
 dirty amenities tiny room pictures are not equivalent to experience,0
 long story short girlfriend booked a room there was no ac window broken and cant be opened needed another room hotel said only twin rooms available but i checked online and there was a double so i had to book the double and pay for it so we are paying for 2 rooms because of the hotel this all seemed unethical and the heat in the room was frankly dangerous i moved on from this but was still annoyed but what felt like the unfair loss of 65 the next day we moved to another room that the hotel said was cooler and it was for a moment but again there was no ac and no window so the heat eventually stated to build up the cleaner barely cleaned the room when asked to and attempted to just flip over the dirty pillow cases instead of changing them asked for a fan 3 times before receiving one attempted to complain politely a number of times 1st manager said he could do nothing customer services said to contact booking com to attempt to get a refund as if booking com put us in a room where the heating was broken and stuck as 28 degrees and booking com could try and get a refund if the hotel is and i quote willing to cooperate last complaint was to an awful awful manager who essentially said i had to accept the fact that i spent a ridiculous amount of money on a second room that day as hard luck gave a half assed apology i ll admit to being rude myself but felt justified this isnt as detailed as i would like but in short i kept extending my stay here because the location is the most convenient for my work but this place is just awful and non of the prices justifiable for a 3 star hotel 7 for 24hour of internet on 1 device in 2017 what a joke sadly just not a funny one ,0
 unhelpful with booking process several phone calls to try and sort it out but had to solve problem myself in the end not very clean inclusive breakfast but only continental supplied had option to pay extra for cooked breakfast ,0
 a beautiful hotel with friendly staff and luxurious bed and plenty to do ,1
 we were told on arrival that we would have to go to another hotel as the boiler had broken down we were not amused as we had 2 small children with us we should have been contacted by reservations we made a fuss and were given a room which was ok when we came back in the evening there was a noise which when we asked staff to have a look at told us it was ventilation we would not have been able to sleep so they moved us to the hotel that we were asked to go to in the daytime ,0
 the room was great lovely bed i had a sofa as well as a nice big tv and lovely bathroom the spa was also good ,1
 very noisy,0
 lovely quiet hotel comfortable with friendly staff ,1
 location the room from inside and the interior of the htel,0
 breakfast bath hot water ,1
 dated hotel and poor interiors and bad room amenities l ,0
 useful things in the room iron ironing board microwave kettle a whole set of crockery for 4 hairdryer safe and fridge the most amazing view of the city especially at night fabulous breakfast,1
i stayed here for 2 nights. booked a double bed room. not very spacious room and the bathroom was not at all clean. worst thing is that bad smell from the bathroom was all over in the room which made our stay very unpleasant. staff were not that friendly. ,0
 first of all the apartments were basically student living and had nothing to do with luxury everything was outdated and the bathrooms were tiny and weren t cleaned properly a housekeeping member forced her way into my room and told us she needed to clean the room so that she can finish her shift early while i was sleeping the food is something shocking for a hotel to serve me a raw burger patty and think that it was acceptable actually its illegal in the united kingdom all i can say is you re better off staying at the rosewood hotel ,0
 everything is very good especially balcony with little table and chairs for breakfast good location,1
 i especially liked my room s well operating walk in non slip shower and bathroom an amenity not always found in other london hotels i also liked the comfortable bed the size of room the good elevators lifts and the proximity to earl s court tube buses cafes shops and atms ,1
 friendly reception and restaurant staff ,1
 genting group that own this hotel are dismissive of guest level of standard this is supposed to be 4 and would hardly pass as 2 run down and out dated decor poor facilities in the rooms unprofessional staff with minimal customer service ,0
 breakfast was lovely so much choice the view from our room was amazing very helpful and attentive staff would definitely come back again ,1
 location and price,1
 small rooms small bathrooms smashed bugs on the walls holes in the wall whole above window stuffed with paper towels poor housekeeping ,0
 the bedroom was far too small to be called a standard room the matress on this bed was very uncomfortable the small bathroom for a couple was hideously tiny in room 722 avoid constant ac throughout the day and night no controls to ever turn it off ,0
 the metro metropolatain only a minute from the hotel great staff friendly and helpful hotel has a great restaurant and there are 15 restaurants only one street away ,1
 eveything,0
 rooms tiny i have stayed there a few times but don t think i will go back wifi disconnects every 2 minutes lots of stairs no lift the rooms used to have a bar fridge but they don t now i complained the room lights were not all working still not working ,0
 this is a wonderful old hotel in a great location easy access to underground but also with walking distant to most attractions serge and bernard made our stay at the russell very special from the moment we arrived to our departure 3 days later they went out of their way to make our stay at the russell memorable ,1
 classic building friendly staff,1
 key cards repeatedly failed and had to be re issued four times basic simple facilities in the room not restocked properly quality of bathroom products very poor advice from reception limited only provided bottled water once when you arrive not replenished ever bathroom cleaning average,0
 excellent location and facilities,1
 hipster central and ridiculously overpriced,0
 bed was very comfy,1
 the staff were very helpful whenever i had problems including helping me contact my taxi firm reception was well staffed at all times when needed there were extra staff equipped with tablets to speed handling the room was spacious ,1
 carpets look really old and dirty hotel looks very old asked for smoking room and it seems the room was smoking and not me couldnt sleep from the smell ,0
 very comfortable bed and smart bathroom very helpful staff and good location ,1
 attitude of the staff,1
 the rooms and shower facilities were very small i am not a extra large person but i am not small either there was no room to do anything other than sidestep around the shower had enough room for an upright hoover and a mop and bucket ,0
 great position for us from st pancras and also for the theatres restaurants etc lovely lighting and staircase in the foyer,1
 the bedroom was very well appointed and the bathroom was excellent ,1
 it was way overpriced the room stank of bo when we got there ,0
 old rooms not clean at all ,0
 i booked a standard twin room and the hotel does have an offer to upgrade to the club room either 50 club lounge breakfast or 30 only breakfast i wanted to have a look at the standard room before i can decide if i need the upgrade to club room and the front desk was telling me they do not have the availability of the standard room and then later she asked the manager on duty 19 4 17 night and the manager said if i go to view the standard room and the offer will be lapsed of course this is a surprise to me that millennium gloucester road is having this policy and also running out of already booked room somehow later they show me a standard room now they have the room in the first floor near the road they said this is the last room usually hotel will not let 100 occupancy for emergency purposes where i did not have a good sleep and wake up every hour in the night they have one row of rooms in that area and if you stay in the hotel good luck bad management not friendly with not objective to make the guest stay feel like home i would recommend millennium copthorn tara instead as the practice in millennium gloucester road is ridiculous ,0
 refused to give us room service said they were busy and we would have to come down and get it ourselves hair dryer theirs blew up in my hand and gave me a 3rd degree burn on my wrist and turned it black concierge staff was very helpful with that front desk staff with exception of assistant manager was just plain rude carpet is a hazard and the train was extremely loud the place needs to be bulldozed ,0
 everything was unsatisfactory and incomplete the sockets werent working we asked for a king sized double bed and were given two single beds the room was so small that we couldn t even walk properly the refrigerator was empty and switched off highly disappointed had really high expectations from hilton but it was not worth the money or anything for that matter never visiting again would not give it more than two stars ,0
 service friendly staff excellent location ,1
 the 4 star rating is not deserved by this hotel the staff doesn t pay attention to the guests or does it as a great favor rather than their jobs your arrival at the hotel starts with you carrying your suitcases up the welcome stairs while the concierges and other staff attending the valet parking and desks my room had a window into the internal ventilation non garden with fans producing constant noise luckily i was staying in this hotel in september as i don t think it is survivable in summer due to lack of a c furniture and bathroom are weared off to the level of a 2 star motel oh and remember to take flip flops when you are going to the shower chances are the floor will have a nice big puddle when you finish ,0
 we liked the split level room,1
 reception staff excellent my partner and i were celebrating an anniversary and the reception put a fruit basket wine in the room and rose petals on the bed excellent service throughout our stay,1
 the baggage man was rude asking us to find a better hotel in mayfair just because we said it is a small room be careful with the entrance 5 steps of stairs which you can not enter with your baby stroller painting smell made me not sleep coughing no view to the street with small opening window wifi is with fee costy hotel with no wifi access no nespresso machine even in delux room only one elevator lift ,0
 cramped room next to noisy building site only stay here if necessary ,0
 no room wifi no jug or tea in room and hotel charged for this as extra,0
 room,0
 the photos and reviews were excellent and i wanted a pool but the place is just shabby the lobby has ridiculous uncomfortable sofas and you have to go there for wi fi or you have to pay for it that is reason enough to skip this place not to mention scuffed furniture torn wall paper carpet worn and seams coming apart the location is next to a construction site on 2 sides the train track screeches constantly and the pool area was closed there is no reason at all to go there to visit london its too far away from everything i was doing business in that end and thank goodness i had to leave early the service was fine ,0
 ideal location for paddington station and the parks and only a good walk to the west end weather permitting greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming rooms were small but well appointed lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good no public space to relax apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar we didn t eat breakfast but the food we saw looked very good the staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp we as a family enjoyed our time here,1
 rooms were very very small air didn t work the entire time even after asking staff to turn it on we slept with the balcony doors open ,0
 10 min max walk from waterloo got bus back to victoria station for airport transfer outside door had a sick family member and got checking in early and option to upgrade which we gladly accepted for 20 per night,1
 the hotel is near the station,1
 hotel rooms were not complete and bathroom areas very small first room we had the shower was broken and there was no hot water we were moved into a second room which included broken air con and tv we were then moved into a third room on our last night which was sufficient whole stay was completely inconvenient we wasted soo much of our time complaining about the rooms and waiting for staff to do something about it terrible dissapointing experience ,0
 staff were really helpful and welcoming i asked in advance if we could have a room with 2 double beds as i was staying with my twin daughters and the reservations assistant was really helpful the rooms were clean comfortable and had tea and coffee making facilities which was great too ,1
 the room was in a different building across a very busy road it didn t feel safe as the was no reception in there breakfast also served across the road the room was not fit for purpose as the glazing was not sufficient to block the noise from the constant traffic of cars busses and coaches ,0
 just about everything the room was advertised as double deluxe but was tiny there was only 12 inches between the bed and the walls hardly any surface space two people would find it completely unmanageable even one average size man would not be comfortable i arrived at 2330 hours just wanted a cup of tea and sleep kettle not working 40 minutes 2 phone calls later a very rude staff person arrived with a pot of hot water i had to argue for a working kettle hardly an extra in a 4 star hotel was offered a marginally larger room but the view was bleak and depressing wifi slow and annoying had to access through hotel portal every time and often restart computer housekeeping poor no soap one day no biscuits the next insufficient milk room not vacuumed air conditioning had a rattling noise specifically asked for london black cab to airport and got company car instead definitely not value for money ,0
 very bad even the croissants are not fresh worse than anything else i would say 2 star level ,0
 fantastic location brilliant staff great facilities ,1
 they don t have any room service i don t recommend the hotel for a seniors room space is to small,0
 swimming pool is closed every hour for private parties staff permanently ignored our requests my child did not have a chance to swim very poor breakfast it is definitely not a five stars probably between 2 and 3,0
 studio was very comfortable and everything,1
 perfect location perfect weekend away,1
 female staff on reception seemed unhappy while serving except one young man who was really trying to help everyone who approaches him too bad i didn t get his name to thank him personally in this review he handled my room change effeciently cleanliness wasn t good nor was the quality of food in room service the towels were very old to the point i was concerned hygiene wise bathroom door wasn t sliding properly shower curtain was very annoying during showering although my room was superior but still it was very small and very uncomfortable i expected better quality considering the location and money value i do not recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
 the room was tiny the ac blew directly into my head the windows were also too close to the bed the blind was ripped the room was dirty the bathroom sink was blocked the wrong room service menu was in the room which delayed my order as i had to wait for delivery of a new menu there are only two hot vegetarian options on the menu the fire alarm went off at 11 30pm i called reception to ask what i should do they said they were investigating and would call me back they did not the ac meant i woke up with a head cold and was feeling ill and missed breakfast i asked for another room but was told the hotel was full i had just come back from paris so was tired and had to do some urgent work i did not have time to follow up on my complaints my stay was awful and made me unwell this is not a four star property and i will not be staying here again i would like a refund i was asked for my email address but have not yet heard back from the hotel they fobbed me off with a free stay for a special occasion but feel i have been fobbed off ,0
 i have had problems with this hotel with regard to taking money from my son s bank account without authorisation they took money out twice before he even went and it was a fuss to get it back but on checking out they took a further 88 over and above the sum due on talking to the staff and manager they were extremely unhelpful and told us to contact his bank my son who is from scotland was left stranded with his girlfriend in london with his bank account wiped out i gave it as a gift and am really angry they still haven t refunded the 88 and i am taking this further i was also horrified to read the latest statements on trip advisor where they are taking unauthorised payments they are a bunch of crooks sorry to say such a shame the lovely hotel ran by them ,0
 the hotel was dirty the rooms were stifling hot and the fan didn t work the carpets didn t fit the floor meaning dirty floorboards were showing there weren t enough seats in the breakfast room for the number of guests meaning guests had to queue for breakfast waitresses didn t speak very good english and could not understand basic requests for salt or sweetener i would not recommend this hotel at all ,0
 great location and gorgeous building ,1
 near earl s court metrostation really easy to reach staff was very friendly ,1
 very dated for a modern looking hotel in such a location the bathroom was mouldy and the bed as hard as a slab of rock awful and too uncomfortable to sleep ,0
 very comfortable room and excellent staff they welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions it was not expensive either i am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well overall an excellent and cozy experience ,1
 lovely spacious room separate toilet and bathroom 3 sinks divider in the middle of the room great location for st dennis stadium and gare du nord modern blackout blinds 2 sets of windows so room was very quiet ,1
 an old very tired hotel drab decor and uncomfortable beds very poor value for money ,0
 loaction staff,1
 easy access to tube station impressive reception ,1
 i was amazed to find this cheap 4 hotel in central london that was a holiday inn more like luxury holiday inn wow great hotel and the most comfortable bed i ve stayed in for a long time ,1
 crisp sheets room including bathroom was spotlessly clean modern smart interior friendly and efficient staff,1
 everything it s a dry hotel if you are a devout religion and want a dry hotel then say so on your website they don t as money is more important to them the rooms are tiny delux king minuscule and bed lumpy room no better than travel lodge and in an awful area lacks any character and is massively over priced,0
on entering the room we were very disappointed with the size and lack of storage and cupboard space. we had nowhere to unload our clothes for our four night stay. the bathroom had no amenities not even a glass to use for a drink of water. the bed was a double bed but had two single duvets and the pillows were very small.   you could not walk around the bed as it was so close to the wall and the only way was to climb over. the tv was high up on the wall making it very uncomfortable to watch. we booked this hotel from the initial pictures shown online. however the room was not as we expected it to be. we stayed for one night and checked out the following morning as we were not happy to stay for another three nights we would not recommend this hotel. ,0
 friendly helpful staff very comfortable rooms superb breakfast and very convenient location,1
 i m not suggesting to any one please check the room before check it hotel,0
 the room was very cold the radiator did not work the tvs channels didn t work the front door did not lock a lot of the switches in the room didn t work i asked for an extra blanket calling room service twice as they forgot and they brought it an hour later ,0
 from the moment we walked in we felt like we were in a dream each design element is so tasteful and we loved the decor furnishings and colours the bed was comfy x 10 the only downfall was that we had to leave our beautiful room to explore the city ,1
 location is good,1
 heating questionable,0
 excellent new hotel fantastic location excellent facilities fantastic standard of buffet breakfast ,1
 wifi not working,0
 comfy well equipped room ,1
 comfy bed,1
 located conveniently close to paddington and not too far from lancaster gate comfortable bed room size was really small as stated but ok for 2 days would visit again ,1
 the lovely view from the 7th floor room of an area of london i know well but not from that perspective ,1
 everything,0
 staff at the front desk were very rude everytime we asked something they looked at us as though we didn t belong there balcony was very dirty not representative of the pictures online room was much smaller than expected ,0
 size of room big and airy ,1
 wifi is not good and there is no safety for things and no water bottle in the room etc,0
 most of it,0
 i make a booking for 4 days in october payed for this 1600 without breakfast it must be a room with a balcon with the view for eiffel tower i did this for almost two months before arrival when i came they give a room where the balcony was not working it was impossible to open the door i spent about 1 5 hours in that evening with the manager but she can t give me another room they move me in another room in a next day and i heard that new arrivals manager put them in my previous room have the same problems with the door for the balcony ones i call to room service and ask them to give me in my room 2 plates i was waiting 30 minets because they have a lot of job daily cloning wasn t good i saw that they don t clean a balcony the phone in my room number wasn t working while staying there 3 days i ask a lot of times to do something with phone but they didn t nothing there was a problem with the keycard 3 times it was not working and i was need to spend the time go go down and make the key again and again after all while check out receptionist gave me the bill where was almost 90 more than i was need to pay i took a calculator to count all that was in the account and i was wright but to prove this i need to call the manager of the hotel again because the guy on reception don t want to accept it and she came and count and i was right what for i need their apologies after all this if they maje so many unpleasant things for such big money ,0
 you see that novotel is reality trying to cut costs on little things such as staff reception and overall services ,0
 room size and all about was very good ,1
 the room was tiny the tv too small and the bathroom minute with a specially narrow bath the curtains did not cut out the light from the window there was no fridge all in all sparsely outfitted and way overpriced for what was on offer ,0
 very old hotel many repairs needed cleanliness was really poor ,0
 stayed here twice both times there was something wrong with the room not one to complain but for the price to put it politely not the best ,0
 most pleasant staff very comfortable rooms ,1
 close to shops and food outlets as well as bus stops ,1
 very convenient location in city centre pretty rooms great boutique hotel,1
 freindly staff great decor good location,1
 dirty towels in room when i checked out the lady at reception didn t seem interested in my complaint i rang the hotel the next day to speak to a manager and was just fobbed off by another rude lady at reception the lady that i spoke to on the phone after i voiced my concerns said it s only a towel will definitely not be staying again poor hygiene standards and very poor customer service ,0
 staff very friendly and polite swimming pool and spa were amazing and i had the best ever pimms cocktail made for me overall would definetly recommend and i would book again in a instance ,1
 perfect style design comfort and staff,1
 fantastic location and staff this property owner is involved and attends to detail it shows up with the clean and well maintained property along with his staff s attention to the guests ,1
 the hotel is very old,0
 the location is excellent 5 10 minutes walk to waterloo station and can walk to many famous places such as big ben london eye hyde park buckingham palace britis museum etc ,1
 really comfortable,1
 the location is close to 3 nearby metros that can get you pretty much anywhere withing 20 30 mins not the most central but its a quiet and safe neighborhood there s a really good cafe down the street called beans on fire ,1
 very dated poor service and way way over priced,0
 the ac didnt work and the rooms were small and old plus the rugs were dirty overall this hotel should be a 1 star only,0
 great size of room excellent breakfast,1
 i arrived friday afternoon a tunesian desk man began to make strange remarks about my nationality first the young desk lady didn t even look at me and helped an indian or pakistanian couple even i was waiting there before this couple asked all the time about parking infront of the hotel and the tunesian guy finally said it s so expensive to park infront of the hotel as in s which is my native country it seems he worked there once and wasn t happy and even if i talked to him in fluent french he tried to respond in german the young lady was very unfriendly as well as the other one next day blond probably russian with poor knowledge of french she was arrogant almost seemed a joke the room was not in a clean and good condition for 110 city tax a very bad location even my dog i wouldn t let go in ,0
 breakfast was amazing,1
 the location the friendly staff the comfort and cleanliness of the room the bathroom the hotel s design the inner court and the lovely bar area,1

 rooms were good self laundry helped a lot,1
 quiet and comfortable,1
 the location was first class and hotel staff so friendly,1
 everything i don t take this hotel agin ,0
 my small single was not as described and paid for it was a cold blocked off back passage with locked half covered external back door with no key or bolt i was afraid someone could unlock the door from the outside the bed was a child s bed with no headboard jammed up against the door there was a small side table no chair desk wardrobe luggage rack iron board hairdryer in fact at 5 4 i could touch both sides of the room simultaneously and only just fitted in the bed luckily i only had a small cabin sized wheelie case and handbag because it would not have been possible to bring a large case in to the room thank goodness i was slim enough to slip in to the tiny ensuite also unfortunately the room was in need of repair and redecoration too the male receptionist was quite unsympathetic and had no idea why i was not happy with the room the hotel was full so i could not be allocated another room room booked weeks prior at 11pm at night he suggested i could go and try and find another hotel he didn t offer to help me and of course i would have had to pay for this corridor overall terrible experience never to be repeated you have been warned ,0
 location location location friendly helpful staff ,1
 the room is too small,0
 helpful staff i wanted to change a room and the receptionist did find one despite the hotel being quite booked he offered me a complimentary drink initially but i did not need it the gym is really great new well equipped the reception area is modern and gives a good vibe ,1
 my stay was totally awfull and the hotel staff were not helpful at all ,0
 staff were amazing tom and so helpful room was nice and bed comfy ,1
 what didn t i like everything major refurb for next year which they don t tell you about so expect noise only one lift for all hotel and that seems to be guests and staff and it keeps breaking reception is temporary on floor 1 breakfast is reduced choice and in temporary room a small room cleaning staff will nock then enter your room despite it being day of check out in my case at 08 15 why not wait till check out ,0
 fantastic location could not be better ,1
 no facilities at all in the room almost unbelievable no kettle even,0
 perfect location you can walk to pretty much all the tourist attractions london eye big ben buckingham palace tower bridge as well as the shopping streets covent garden oxford street hotel itself is very clean nice personal the restaurant bar and roomservice are also good ,1
 great bed breakfast staff,1
 great location and service friendly helpful staff we arrived early and as our room was ready we could check in early which meant we could get on with the rest of our day ,1
 excellent location ,1
 the bed was comfy and facilities good ,1
 very friendly and helpful receptionists specially one guy who worked in the evening i forgot his name he knows how to take care of the customers ,1
 too noisy and small,0
 staff,1
 friendly staff very stylish hotel close to the center,1
 nothing ,0
 our bedsheets were not changed once during our entire stay our mini bar was not restocked food was cold in the restaurant upon checkout they charged my card for our dinner in the restaurant despite us paying by cash on the night when we explained we were told if we did pay they would fix it we got our refund in the end but as we were on our honeymoon we didn t feel like we needed the added stress ,0
 room smelled badly and it was impossible to breathe in it without leaving the window open towels smelled like they haven t been properly dried as well bed was obviously used before i got there as there was hair on it internet was unusable after 9 pm single rooms are too small for decent stay ,0
 politeness and efficiency,1
 unhelpful staff lack of information smell in room member of staff in room on arrival dirty outdated bathroom would not class as delux rubbish view noisy neighbours ,0
 the bed was comfy and i liked the fact that when i came back to the room from an afternoon walk the room was tidied up again ,1
 i booked a double bed with a window paid extra to avoid a room without window but got a twin room with no window there was a queue of around 15 20 people to checkin and the staff were very slow i had to wait more than 30 minutes staff need basic training in customer service most of them cudnt understand english and had to call thier supervisor to answer a question while i was checkin out the lady at the counter appeared very rude and she dint even bother to look at my face ,0
 the comfort of the bed,1
 the front desk at night is empty the staff setting at guest area at check in they gave me wrong room when i entered i found a sleepy man old furniture not clean well old carpet old and bad elevator ,0
 arriving at 10 30 pm to find out our prepaid room had been sold and then waiting over an hour to be given an inferior room with little by way of an apology dirty bed sheets ,0
 exceptional reception staff at ground and second floor they satisfied every special request i made the room was sparkle clean and fully equipped very good breakfast and the bartenders were very friendly and charming located at 1 minute from hammersmith tube station the perfect stay ,1
 i booked a delux room i dread to think what a standard room looks like dirty carpets blocked sink toilet that would not flush properly chipped mugs a reception clerk who was not interested i would not stay there again ,0
 closed the bar to guests could only order drinks through room service ,0
 very nice outdoor terrace,1
 smoky room from previous occupant staff wouldn t change us but would only leave the window open our bed was two single beds sewn together most of the guests wore capes and masks we did not think we were in england no ambience no free wifi no breakfast included despite their outrageous tariffs no facilities we could not wait to leave this sterile soulless hotel ,0
 room wasn t clean reception were rude during 3 days not even once they cleaned our room i give 0 star to the hotel,0
 rooms were extremely tiny definitely too small for two people sharing and for more than a single night stay rooms were not cleaned well thick layer of dust remained everywhere for all 4 days of our stay and there were stains on the bed covers as well as the curtains cleaners actually used some of our body lotion which was kept away inside the cupboard while we were out for the day ,0
 staff were very nice and hotel close to station,1
 very quiet very private,1
 the room we were given looked better than your pictures staff were amazingly helpful and when we left i felt as though good friends were saying good bye to us very personalised service superb breakfasts,1
 nice hotel near paddington station,1
 staff were really lovely very professional and they treated me well ,1
 the location of the hotel is excellent and our room was quiet ,1
 we had expected traditional hilton comfort luxury but disappointed by the room beds bathroom and overall this is the poorest hilton we have ever stayed ,0
 safe was broken held my passport and cash without receipts had to beg for soap and towels fruit was old and bruised should have not been charged 85 for bar in room since i did not have a safe and electricity went out and food spiiled,0
 after paying extra for an executive king room the lady in reception tried to give us a room in the basement with no window after returning to reception and arguing and told that there are no more rooms available we eventually were given the room we had booked with a window the shower was freezing in the morning and night at midday tho you could get a hot shower tho the staff in the restaurant were unhelpful and the continental breakfast was poor ,0
 the room was decent size and clean the bed was comfortable we were only in the room to sleep as we had a busy evening and an even busier following day we were on the other side of the hotel this time facing the street rather than the motor way so it was quieter ,1
 excellent location near chatelet les halles station and very close to lovely bars and restaurants small rooms but comfortable beds and location makes up for it quick and satisfying breakfast,1
 bathroom was a big disappointment moldy n some places somewhat awkward layout the hotel runs a program that if you don t want the room cleaned put a sign on door handle and get 5 voucher the sign was ignored on several occasions once the room wasn t cleaned but we got no voucher once it was cleaned even with the sign on we gave up on one of the days room clean up showed at 5 pm they are clearly understaffed in cleaning department ,0
 plenty of places to eat near by if you don t fancy the menu at the hotel just walk through the o2 to see them all tube system is literally a 5 minute walk away and the emirates air rail is 10 minutes away both great for getting around and seeing sites throughout london the beds are very comfortable and the rooms look prestige bathroom looks amazing too upon entrance to the hotel you re greeted very politely and even walked over to the check in desk where the staff are fantastic and tell you all about the local area and explain everything clearly the entrance lobby looks fantastic too ,1

 hotel receptionist male was unhelpful and dismissive i have written a letter of compliant reference the absence of cold running water in room 352 we had no cold water to drink or to cool hot water for bathing plug in bath was blocked and many other things spoiled our stay we have received no response to our letter of complaint i will now take this up with my credit card company as the contract with the hotel to supply me with a comfortable room was not met ,0
 fantastic for 02 the views of knight outstanding ,1
 the only reason i booked with hotel russell was because of the bath advertised to be in my room but when i got there it looked nothing like in the picture it was dirty and had badly chipped enamel there weren t any complementary items worth mentioning just a small amount of cheap shampoo and the room took ages to heat up ,0

 bugs very unpleasant ,0
 room smelled like a smoking room disgusting and for a hilton hotel not appropriate a hotel that charges you 300 pounds a night should provide a free internet access we are living in the digital age guys you should rethink your business model the trend will be clearly to have free wifi and hilton will charge the guests till the last moment they can until the competition provides free wifi lead the market don t follow ,0

 the room was great and the location was terrific easy to get to on the underground from heathrow ,1
 rooms very small and not representing 4 star status comparatively expensive and not value for money the hotel forcefully charged 25 euro per day for child although our child is never been a crib sleeper and it was compulsory to hire which was not stated while booking and the most important the room service didn t make up over room and on demand they said the hotel will charge you for making up the room in france its is like this ,0
 very helpful staff all round great place to stay spotlessly clean and very close to earls court tube station ,1
 the location was perfect close to the underground restaurants etc yet quiet the food both breakfast and lunch was delicious fresh flavorful the staff throughout from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant were delightful the room was spotless bed was heavenly view from the room was a beautiful garden perfect conclusion to our 3 week stay in the uk,1
 there was no mixer in the bathroom the windows were old and a draft of cold air was coming through which was still bearable but then the noise com the street especially during the nigh and very early morning was particularly loud and intolerable the rug kilim was particularly dirty the hallways were very narrow and the air was heavy the staff though very polite was not sincerely helpful ,0
 the room is a great size and very comfortable all you could want in a hotel room ,1
 location rooms are clean and big,1
 air conditioning was terrible hardly any teabags supplied,0
 late check in and overcharged ,0

 extremely comfortable superb service great shower very clean and modern nice cosy bar and opposite hyde park,1
 my experience with this hotel was quite bad as follows when we had arrived we were not greeted at the entrance by any concierge or bellboy and left to us to take our luggage into the hotel ourselves but once we got to the front desk i began speaking to one of the staff and was rudely interrupted by another most likely more senior staff who insisted on assisting with my check in once all of the particulars were given it was time to speak about the payment even though i had already made the booking and payment through booking com what annoyed me tremendously is the way in which i was spoken to it seems many hotels in london have staff with attitude problems where they speak to guests as if they cannot afford the stay so to speak quite infuriating and pretty much set the precedent for the rest of the stay the bed was ridiculously small for 2 people if you make a half turn from the centre of the bed you are already at the edge of the bed good luck if you toss and turn during sleep don t be surprised to find yourself waking up on the floor the room looked tired and unattractive the carpets were frayed inside the room and in the corridor and all of the furniture in the room was worn and tired i approached the front desk requesting assistance in organising a chauffeured ride to heathrow airport and instead of assisting me the front desk staff just told me to speak to the concierge nothing wrong with that but the problem in this case was that there was no human being at the concierge desk which was right across on the right hand side of the staff member all she had to do was look to the right and she would have seen there was no one there in any case i walked across waiting 10 minutes for someone to come but no one appeared which was quite disturbing i just gave up in the end and used an online booking service instead ,0
 lovely hotel great location for earls court tube extremely comfortable beds which is very important after a day of london sightseeing and very quiet we had a great sleep both nights ,1
 clean tidy good location,1
 tv not working only few channels bed unconfortable bad smell in the corridors,0
 the staff are really friendly,1
 rooms are comfortable spacious and bathroom was very clean ,1
 i m amazed that this place is considered 4 star hotel i would hate to see a 2 or 3 star either the aa reviewer is completely blind or the hotel has painted an extra couple of stars on themselves grumpy staff badly threadbare carpets tired decor non functional aircon and a broken lift i didn t want to risk eating in the restaurant judging by the rest of the hotel and the fact that the enticer menu in the lift had serious spelling errors i arrived in my cupboard sorry room which hadn t been hoovered to find that the tiny room was baking on discovery that the aircon was broken i called reception to be told that all air con in the hotel has been disabled for winter i ended up having to stick a fan in an open window to try to cool down the room fortunately there was not much room to cool lets just say that after a shower it was not possible to stand at the end of the bed to to use the towel as there wasn t enough room all in all a very unpleasant and overpriced place to stay needless to say i shall not be returning here ,0
 lovley place great helpful staff went out of their way to make us comfortable the room was superb i wouldnt think twice on booking again,1
 pillows were hard but everything else was excellent,1
 location is good just outside hyde park walking distance 30 min from the city centre very accomodating staff members ,1
 the bed was awful room freezing cold due to heating not working the toilet blocked several times tv was tiny and i could hear every word from the room next door to top it off the iron which must be about 15 years old ruined the shirt my boyfriend had just purchased for the evening due to the dirt inside ,0
 great hotel,1
 very friendly and welcoming staff good room and comfort level for an overnighter ,1
 the beds no working air con no opening windows horrible decor huge amount of construction work right outside the hotel with no attempt at warning the guests miserable staff no information offered on check in no interest when complaint made ,0
 this hotel needs a huge overhaul the bedrooms were so dirty grubby and run down the walls and ceiling are covered in grubby stains and there are more stains on the ceiling from what looks to be a water leak the headboard was covered in stains the bathroom looked like it hadn t been cleaned in years dust on every surface carpets worn to a thread in places windows can t be opened and as the rooms are so small it was very stuffy never saw a staff member smile unfriendly location is excellent but nothing else going for this hotel ,0
 everything,0
 there is no friendly assistance or polite of guest questions the reciption very rude,0

 staff rude i had pre paid before we had arrived when we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice hotel is quite old fashioned not up to 4star standards rooms are very small also bathroom wouldn t return again ,0
 the hotel was ideal for the concert at the o2 as we only had a short walk to the venue hotel reception was was a pleasant experience and mario who checked us in was very welcoming room had a great view gym and pool were excellent the best overnight stay we ever had and we will be returning in july ,1
 dirty room noise of boiler all night freezing room bathroom falling apart pictures held up with bluetac above our heads cigarette burns in blinds ignorant staff,0
 fantastic room with outstanding views of the city the staff were extremely attentive and our room was spotless and comfy loads to choose from at breakfast which was served until 11am great for a nice lay in would recommend to all ,1
 we accidentally left a pair of shoes converse in leather almost new in the room call the hotel on the same night of check out and the next morning the hotel claimed that they have never found anything left in the room lack of honesty lack of security ,0
 we had complimentary wine and fruit for a birthday in the room which was a lovely touch all the staff were very friendly and helpful,1
 excellent helpful staff,1
 absolutely amazing service attention to detail terrific staff went out of their way for us we couldn t get a taxi and the wonderful concierge got the hotel car and drove us to the bus stop nothing was too much trouble i have nothing but praise for this hotel breakfast was fantastic ,1

 good location,1
 the tea and breakfast were really good,1
 staff really friendly,1
 i didnot like anything in there,0
 the whole experience,0
 room very small for 4 and quite scruffy in places wiring for hairdryer would not pass any electrical inspection kept awake 3 nights out of 4 by people in the room above flushing toilet and walking about sound deading poor somebody had badly fitted hardwood floor in our room no doubt to save money on carpets breakfast basic to say the least boy do we need to learn from our continental neighbours i apologies to any one from abroad not all our hotels are as bad as this one no extractor fan in bathroom so damp and generally run down also the basins where plumbed the wrong way around which to me is a sign of poor workmanship how it gets aa four stars beats me a very poor 3 more like will take th aa ratings with pinch of salt in future l have been all over europe and this puts me off visiting my home capital my impression was because it s london and the demand is high the effort can be low ,0
 perfect location for visiting hammersmith apollo nice bar area friendly staff ,1
 everything will be back ,1
 afternoon tea provided friendly staff always helpful ,1
 rooms to small you couldn t swing a cat if you tried and that was supposedly an upgrade to a double room you can clearly hear the underground passing beneath and the walls are desperately thin meaning you hear everything next door ,0
 decor of rooms and rude unhelpful staff,0
 the small balcony overlooking the arch and the metro station which is right outside the hotel entrance,1
 great check in staff and loved the room ,1
 noise,0
 the breakfast was amazing and the staff could not do enough only a 15 minute walk from covent garden,1
 arriving at 11 00pm tired but waited one hour because the hotel staff said that he could not find see my reservation in the hotel system very unpleasant stay with a short night disappointed by both the hotel and booking com will never book again this one ,0

 large room comfortable bed good wifi and easy access to public transportation the toiletries are also very nice quality room was very quiet ,1
 good service good staff very friendly helpful everthing you need for that perfect stay ,1
 it s not a secret that paris service standards can leave foreigners cold and the reception i had at this hotel was a perfectly brutal example example night desk man was rude at entry extremely perturbed to have been bothered to step away from his internet to answer the door chastised me for trying the back door first terrible check in obnoxious cold condescending and then when i asked him to please cool it he wasted no time launching into the insults condescension and defending his actions as legitimate as if his paying customers cared le coup de grace you foreigners think your money buys you everything well actually sir this foreigner s money will simply buy me reservations every few weeks at the polite hotels in paris where they appreciate the customers and don t put them down hotel diva indeed ,0
 the bed was extra comfy cleanliness was beautiful,1
 apart from a grumpy bathroom for disability guest the room temperature was over heated bed was not comfy and bed linens aren t comfy wardrobe space is adequate oh afternoon tea quality does not lived up to expectations poor quality ,0
 i liked the green elephant outside the condition of the room after it was cleaned was exceptional the bathroom was stunning having a free bottle of still and sparkling water every day was brilliant there was an ironing board kettle hairdryer safe fridge free wifi i was very comfortable the whole stay it was also very quiet food in the restaurant was 5 star,1
 excellent location good size bedroom excellent food and wine albeit on the expensive side pool and spa facilities ,1
 all staff were very helpful and friendly they allowed me to use the microwave to sterilise my babies bottles and provided us with a cot and storage for the pushchair downstairs overnight so we didn t have to carry it upstairs couldnt of wished for a more ,1
 3 bedroom ridiculously cramped and a rip off for the price no extractor fan in bathroom slow flow of water,0
 the room was so cramped that there was no space between the bed end and the wall to be able to close the window blind an executive king room i do not think so the awful red marble in the bathrooms was like an autopsy had been carried out the blinds at the window once i had crawled across the bed to close them were filthy the room smelt musty there was no mirror in the room to dry one s hair by i had to guess what i looked like it was basically rubbish and i didn t want to stay for breakfast the reception staff had no idea of the local area and told me the road i was looking for was 11 minutes away it was across the road visible from the reception desk ,0
 credit card didn t work at ceck in at 2 00 am in the morning the manager in charge who was very rude and unfriendly refused to let me check in and asked for cash to get at the machine in the hotel which didn t work hotel manager insited to talk to my bank to get the ok for check in at 2 30 am which took another 30 minutes due to connection problems finally i made it with the same credit card to get cash at a nearby natwest cash machine totally inapproriate behaviour of manager the two receptionists ecxused for manager s behaviour which was extermely unpleasant for all involved breakfast starts at 7 00 am which is a problem for business people or guests who need to leave early in the morning ,0
 the room was excellent warm with high quality facilities the toiletries were lovely and luxury fluffy towels we also had an excellent meal in the hotel restaurant,1
 we found that the staff who dealt with our check and the breakfast staff were unwelcoming rude and incompetent breakfast was a shambles with large pot of coffee and tea left on all the tables for the whole morning for all guests no fresh tea or coffee the table was not cleaned and the breakfast bar looked unappetising we walked out of breakfast and went elsewhere although it says there is a choice of restaurants only one was open in the evening we met a couple who had been given a room that was already occupied and with a key that let them into the room ,0
 they put two dipped singles together wasn t a double no water in the morning oh and dirty towels hotel has a funny smell toilet made a noise all night oh and the heating seems to come on at 4am and the closest tube is 20min walk do yourself a favour stay closer to the centre if that s what your coming to london for ,0
 much too small and does not deserve the 4 stars rating by far,0
 the staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen ,1
 we really liked the helpful staff the food was great and the welcome pack for the children was a lovely touch ,1
 the overall stay was made outstanding by the help of the staff everything about the stay was out of this world ,1
 very ugly building from the 1960 70s probably the ugliest in the whole area i am pretty sure that many parts of the building haven t been renovated since the hotel needs massive modernisation refurbishing the 15th floor restaurant was so sad i left it immediately beautiful views at least it took literally 15 minutes for the water to get warm in the shower what a waste of water resources taking a quick shower is not possible at this hotel where does the hot water come from the middle of the earth even then the temperature was not constant i was given a first room with very poor wifi reception i got moved to a second room which was next door to a lift shaft and it was pretty noisy london is expensive for hotels but honestly who gives stars to hotels in uk 4 stars for this place cmon,0
 bed sheets proved to be unclean as one of us got scabies after our stay at this hotel ,0
 rooms were clean and comfortable great shower facility breakfast was great and had everything we wanted staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 amazing place to stay very friendly staff amazing views from sky lounge,1
 they charged me double for the room for some reason ended up taking over 600 pound from my account after a long phone call they refunded the money but took 5 working days strange because they tried to do the same to my friend who luckily didn t have enough money for them to take be careful ,0
 julian at the front desk was magnificent in helping me to book for an additional night when i was under pressure a real ambassador for the hotel and the company ,1
 quiet comfortable room,1
 lovely hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful rooms were excellent as was the service great views from the bars and restaurant perfect for the o2 arena will be staying again ,1
 the room furniture except the bed was run down the bathroom was too old and overused with minimum maintenance the carpets were dirty and the wall paper was torn in many places and dirty the staff is very negligent we reported that the water from the bathtub was not draining well and it took them 3 days to respond after 3 consecutive reminders in person i even filled a feedback form and kept it at the reception but no one bothered to check with us or call back this property is simply run down and the money we paid for this stay was too high for what we got ,0
 service wasn t very good,0
 the hotel was being refurbished while i was there and there was no air conditioning my room was like a sauna and i couldn t sleep with the windows open because of the noise of the traffic outside there was supposed to be bottled water available in each of the rooms and the staff were supposed to leave the curtains closed to keep the temperature down didn t happen in my case ,0
 cracking location lovely modern bathroom and bedroom,1
 excellent central location very professional courteous staff breakfast buffet was great ,1
 the hotel is located in a very nice area of amsterdam there are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city staff were very kind ,1
 location,1
 location and the special price i would not have paid full price for this hotel,1
 room temperature fluctuated between cold and too hot advised by reception that this was a problem that they d had a while but couldn t fix was given the option of opening a window overlooking the noisy tube line or a fan difficult to sleep very tired decor quality of room service was poor and staff service could be much better ,0
 i paid 12 95 for cheese an egg and some ham for breakfast since i don t eat bread my choices were really limited the bathroom was dirty my toilet seat had a yellow patch on it and a stray pube ,0
 reception staff stunning views from room hotel location gym power showers excellent customer service from all staff,1
 great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food ,1
 bedroom too small,0
 i loved the location the ambiance of the hotel was fantastic and the staff were very accommodating,1
 this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority it is starting to look frayed at the edges but there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good the location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,1
 bathroom was disgusting and shower did not work hotel in need of complete renovation and the pictures on booking com are nothing like what the hotel is actually like ,0
 expensive for what you got for your money ask if we cud up grade but got told had a good rm already which was only ok stayed in better standard rm had plastic film around windows due wk being done outside and floor was spongey probably due water getting under neath it was not happy considering how much we paid for a studio rm big let down ,0
 everything was great at the hotel until breakfast which was a shambles long line of people waiting to be seated tried to push 3 of us on a very small table for 2 and did not like it when we refused to be seated until they found a table for 3 people ,0
 the location was great,1
 location impressive lobby,1
 cosey room very small bed against a wall fan worked when it wanted to work scaffold outside window ,0
 we were told we had been upgraded if that was the case i dread to think what the original room was like ,0
 the equipment of hotel is too old ,0
 the comfort services and to be able to enjoy the calmness and silence afther a very busy day ,1
 stuffy and somewhat pretentious expensive for what it really is arrived there quite tired and bathroom had a huge leak that is no one took care to check the room previously had to wait until another room was available but by then i decided to leave the hotel didn t get a refund would lower its rate to three stars ,0
 the fact that the air conditioning had been turned off for the whole summer they say its a technical fault it isnt my uncle is a air conditing engineer and there is no fault that cannot be fixed in days slightly longer if a certain part is needed but rarely and that the hotel had not let people know that and give them the option to cancel they also always show on their website pictures of rooms you will never stay in the actual rooms they give you are horrible when you ask for a change the staff will lie and say the hotel is full this is not true my recommendation check on line if they say this but really my recommendation is dont stay in this hotel unless you like tyrolean style rooms in the attic with no air conditioning ,0
 location near the underground station is super convenient had a quick meal at the bar and really liked the food beds were good too twin superior room ,1
 room had no windows and very noisy air conditioning lack of clear direction from staff to rooms,0
 i thought the hotel lacked in every aspect from hospitality to basic cleanliness i can t think of one thing that would make me want to come and stay here again there s were stains on upholstery throughout the room from bed linen to curtains and the room in general looked very very different to the pictures i couldn t wait to check out in the morning ,0
 very small elevator no master bed mattress provided and placed at the loft,0
 staff in the reception i hate how the talk with us they are not helpful only because i don t want to upgrade my room they give me bad room for single and we r two people,0
 slow check in service room is quite small no toothpaste set no slippers ,0
 great breakfast friendly service,1
 staff were extremely helpful and polite,1
 good peaple in reception,0
 very nice hotel in a convenient fairly quiet for london location staff were friendly rooms were a good size comfortable clean ,1
 bumped us up as it was our wedding anniversary and threw in a bottle of wine very nice of them and would recommend the hotel ,1
 the room has been behind the reception extremly small and very noisy and located on the ground floor with window to the backyard where people have been sitting and smoking when we arrived we had to wait 40 minutes because the receptionist was on his break the breakfast was kind of normal nothing really special i really cannot understand why the hotel is rated so highly ,0
 the staff was rude the air blew cool the first night but warm the second night the temperature outside was not low enough for heat when my wife called the front desk the gentleman was rude and condescending to her when she asked if the air conditioning was switched to heat or was there something wrong with our unit i didnt appreciate his attitude especially for the amount of money i paid the staff needs more training don t plan to stay there again and definitely don t recommend this place,0
 tired decor milk 6 months out of date in room tray lights not working in bathroom hairdryer not working pretty poor overall ,0
 booked a second room for a family friend ending up getting a room that s not the one that i wanted ending up paying more manager on duty oct 20th in the afternoon was a prick ,0
 staff argued with me over something minor very poor customer service rooms and d cor was extremely shabby and outdated i felt it disrespectful and shameful that genting casino uk that owns this property was quick enough to take clients money but put no effort into making the rooms look any better than a poor 2 star staff need training in customer service the price of the room is not that much cheaper than the marriott in grosvenor square where i stayed the remaining nights of my trip park lane mews shameful,0
 location rooms staff,1
 they did not solve my wifi issues but instead ran me in circles with various excuses that were inconsistent some would say it s out of service other would say there are dark spots in hotel one tried to help for 30 second and gave up they seemed understaffed and willing to give random answers without trying to help i was there for business and won t return also non dairy breakfast options were inadequate ,0
 the staff friendly but hotel is totally mis sold online it is dated and has no facilities also rooms not modern like pics and was still dirty no air con working a t v was broken not happy after paying 550 for two nights in my birthday,0
 reception staff very unfriendly and nervous ,0
 the room was terrible an underground room in the basement with a cold draught half a window overlooking rubbish and trash i increased temperature and it didn t work had to walk to reception to ask for help as phone was not working and nobody turned up to help with heating or phone there was hardly wifi and reception and i had to stand up aginst the window for signals i couldn t speak to colleagues to find out where they were it wasn t a good experience i asked for a refund and was told to speak to booking com i left 3hours later to a neighbouring hotel ,0
 gorgeous room top quality felt brand new so good ,1
 hate everything,0
 the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming,1
 staff and facilities exeded my expectations ,1
 great personal service comfy modern room,1
 bed knackered leans to one side room too small 3 floor in roof space and bathroom toilet i could not sit down,0
 reception area very modern rooms small and very shabby dirty rooms peeling wallpaper ,0
 we booked paris view room with high price but hotel didn t prepare paris view room for us they say it was just a request and they do not have a responsibility to keep a paris view room for us so there s no sense to book a paris view room with high price ,0
 the rooms were to small and everything crammed in the overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work there was excessive noise from outside i e the kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about 5 which is ridiculous the air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it the tv remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the tv unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn tv off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise ,0
 staff rude and when i continuously refused to accept a room without a window they became aggressive to the extent that i said i would call the police,0
 the hotel does not look like in the pictures breakfat poor quality housekeeping staff knock once on your door then open with you being inside room are very small and the lift if you have 3 bags you have to take the lift 3times ,0
 fire alarm went off in the nigh moe than once then housekeeping woke us up only gave very little discount for the inconvenience ,0
 heater were broken in the two rooms they didn t change room didn t bring additional heater or even blankets really bad experience in a supposed 4 star hotel,0
 room was so small and very claustrophobic view was in to next room and i could of crawlled in to their room and vice verca as the locks were broke on window noisy at night will not be staying again awful ,0
 disappointed with the room for the cost pretty poor standard room and the breakfast was not nice at all,0
 we booked 2 double deluxe rooms my partner and i arrived on friday to find out room was very small bed very small wardrobe you couldn t open without the door hitting the tv my parents arrived on the saturday to find they had a club room this room was a lot bigger very well presented had a lot of freebies i immediately went to reception and asked why this was they had been given a complementary room upgrade as they had no deluxe rooms left on our departure sunday my parents were then billed for the room upgrade they had to fight there corner a little and explained that they were given a complementary upgrade as i found out and they did knock this off in the end ,0
 great hotel everything was excellent ,1
 everything,0
 room was great as was location,1
 the room was filthy and very old,0
 closet sized room small even for eu standards construction ongoing so had to walk up from side entrance ,0
 cleanliness not smoke free in the rooms and hallways rude night shift first two days until i confronted them rooms smelled and dingy need major upgrade definitely not 4 star 2 star at most ,0
 friendly staff and comfortable rooms got an upgrade good value for the location in london,1
 woken up by cleaners banging early in the morning room very small and smelt like drains bad customer service ,0
 checked in with family around 7 30pm given room keys for a 1st floor room upon entering room there was no sofa bed for kids had to go back to reception and queue again to be seen where i was first advised that i had not booked family room upon showing the booking ref where it did show the family room was booked we were given a new room on 7th floor upon moving from the 1st floor to the 7th floor the keys didn t open the door so had to leave the family in the corridor go back to reception again queue again to get new keys upon entry to the room the sofa bed was not made up so had to wait for house keeping to arrive to make up the whole check in period from first entering reception to actually getting everything sorted in the room approx 40mins which isn t good at the end of a long day when you have tired kids after all this turned on the tv and the remote control didn t work at this point gave up and went to sleep p s you have to pay extra to use the hotels own services i e swimming pool ,0
 it was the ambience and the weekend was a success ,1
 this is a 2 star hotel not a 4 as listed it had an odour from the first floor up and in the rooms furniture is shabby and everywhere needs a refurbishment it isn t that the cleaning wasn t done it is just run down in general i would not recommend this hotel at all the location is great ,0
 nothing,0
 location staff quietly courteous v good breakfast good shower proximity to tube ,1
 terrible customer service never a 4 star hotel we booked a one bed apartment which they didn t reserve for us and then tried to give us two very poor condition double bedrooms and tried to blame booking com for this mix up and then lied about the reasons for this cleanliness needs improved constant stream of complaints from all customers when we were there we will never return here nor recommend this hotel to anyone noisey pipework and air con system rattled all night i could go on ,0
 i payed 2 nights even though i was staying only 1 night because i needed to check in early in the morning in order to take a shower after 15 hours trip due to business meetings the hotel didnt give me the room in the morning arguing a non show even though the room was payed for the prevoius night i wont stay at that hotel again ,0
 location walking distance to many sights nice staff ,1
 we have stayed at other apex hotels so we knew we would like this one ,1
 room was ok if a little small and this was a king executive tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable i requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated ,1
 super room with a great view of the london eye attentive staff and a very comfortable bed ,1
 mala atencion del personal,0
 the whole experience was great ,1
 great room spotlessly clean brilliant location very pleasant and helpful staff ,1
 room and bed,0
 our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms we moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine we found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated to spend more then 243 euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery ,0
 the english breakfast was great the staff were very friendly and accommodating and the hotel was in a great location in terms of value for money ,1
 the classic ambience of the bar and the helpfulness of all the staff,1
 no ac when it is mentioned that they have one when booking rooms poor wifi hotel stinks and carpets need refurbishing ,0

 we arrived on the water taxi we struggled to find the hotel we eventually found out it was one stop on the dlr when we arrived there was nowhere to eat and an hour wait for food we couldn t even get crisps from the crowded bar we were mislead about a 10 minute walk to the o2 that what it said on the web site when we booked we had to pay 18 for a taxi ,0
 great location very clean rooms hot drink making facilities in the room are very good ,1
 booked a double room on check in at 11 30 at night i was informed they only had a twin bedroom the only choices were to take it or cancel the booking too late to go anywhere else so we took the room couldn t enjoy our night together and the bed aggravated my partners sciatica not a pleasant stay ,0
 expensive decor and furniture is looking tired shower was but a trickle and not very hot and beds very hard and uncomfortable ,0

 everithing ,0
 perfect hotel for the price the staff are friendly the clearners are nice and go the extra mile i felt like i had to leave a tip the hotel is overlooking a nice park and isn t too far from the metro room had everything you could possible need clean and modern,1
 bed pillows were very hard the sink was cracked water did not empty from sink very well tv control was not working right some staff did not understand english very well got different answers from different staff concierge did not have enough information to help you i booked it as a 4 but would only class it as a 3 was quite disappointed would not recommend it as a 4 to friends ,0
 very old tired inside needs a complete overhaul but keeping the old style of it as really is well worth keeping ,0
 friendly staff and good location ,1
 location was excellent reception staff very very welcoming and professional robert the porter so helpful also the others rooms although small were so clean also bathrooms had tea making facilities and well stocked excellent value for money ,1
 this hotel really looks nice in a pictures but in the real very bad room very very small bad smell in the room from the bathroom the wall has broken areas the bath very small charge for tv is very high and no free tv i have photos to the room how was the door and the wall damage but i couldn t download long time waiting the lift when it s come only for 2 persons i booked 2 rooms 240 for 1 room per night then i want to cancel the booking they don t accept to return my money bcz i paid cash and the said they don t have cash then i can cancel only 1 night from my booking which was 3 nights really really the municipality of paris should check it again to rate it as 3 stars not 5 stars i met the another guest in lift he was the same feeling about this hotel facilities it s only have radisson blue name no any other thing radisson finally i suggest all the traveler to don t take this hotel and i m always on travel and this is the first time i feel i got the wrong booking hotel always i m happy with other hotels ,0
 could hear next door snoring breakfast took 25 minutes to arrive and staff were arguing with each other in front of customers very noisy as work is going on all around the hotel externally,0
 the hotel operated with only one staff member with very poor receptions and rooms,0
 there is no service room dirty no service due to shortage of manpower small room,0
 staff were very professional heating was very good room warmed up or cooled down quickly ,1
 it was the worst experience ever unprofessional personnel messed up reservations room which has never been properly clean awful experience no proper air con in 37c heat and room with remains of previous guest dirty coffee cups and dirty surfaces broken lamps the list can go on ,0
 beautiful lobby kind personal comfortable bed breakfast is good served at glamourous interior location is very close to hyde park with a lot of small restaurants around ,1
 loved the service the breakfast variety plenty of seating and spotless and the staff were always so very helpful and extremely pleasant everything you could have wanted was here at this hotel superb ,1
 if i m working in london it s my preferred choice every time ,1
 the rooms and facilities were shocking and poor value for money and the service at dinner in the evening took over an hour to deliver our food to the table ,0
 great small luxury hotel good size well equipped rooms excellent location for central london on the strand near the thames and close to covent garden spa ,1
 i like everything the food the locaci n but the kindness and consideration of the personal with my one year old daughter was very nice thank you so much ,1
 i didn t like it at all very small rooms very small toilets very noisy a lot of maintenance and noise from the early morning i dont know how its rated 5 stars ,0
 horrible smell in room rooms in desperate need for renovation ,0
 the location and price was great rooms in london are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick if you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged it ends at 10 am and you probably will oversleep ,1
 my room was in the basement no window and natural light not a good deal indeed ,0
 the shower did not work the wardrobe doors did not close ceilings are cracked the hotel is badly maintained and the staff in the spar are very rude your made to feel an inconvenience to them ,0
 the room is large and has all features the staff was helpful the room quiet comfortable near the hammersmith station and its shopping facilities in the room everything worked well ,1
 the building is appropriately glamorous for a hotel in london s centre the staff was very nice and helpful the breakfast was delicious and offered the whole variety of a full monty ,1
 comfy room well appointed,1
 dirty small rooms,0
 clean spacious comfortable great location,1
 everything else,0
 location is terrible the staff was mediocre soft beds poor cleaning staff overall it felt like a cheap knockoff of a luxury hotel would not recommend it ,0
 the worst hotel ever the room was bad small old and smelly not very clean some electoral lightning was not even working,0
 the room was so small the room was very cold and was kept awake all night with noise ,0
 we were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night he was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special ,1
 location good staff friendly helpful facilities in room good,1
 location price service ratio is very good ,1
 room not ready at 2pm checked in at 4pm no credit card was asked for at checkin caused a lot of issues when ordering drinks once into room we waited 2 hours while it was cleaned it was filthy dirt all over the bathroom ,0
 the staff was unhelpful and careless we arrived at the hotel just before midnight we booked the hotel because we went to a concert nearby and thought that it would be easier to stay close to work than drive back home we arrived hungry wet it was raining a lot and tired while my partner went to look for a car parking as the hotel didn t have any car parking space left i checked in and went to the room i arrived at the bedroom and realised that they gave us a disable room which wasn t so bad but not attractive before i heading to a shower i ordered some food pizza and a salad which was around 12 05am and the person who took our order mentioned that the food would be with us in 25 35 minutes after ordering the dinner i went to have a shower and for my disappointment and frustration the water wasn t warm enough and the shower was weak and the thermostat was broken i finish my shower and was still feeling cold and annoyed as i expected to have a warm and relaxing shower before go to bed so i asked the reception if they could move us to another room where the shower worked so at least my partner could have a warm shower so after 5 8 minutes the manager arrived in the room to check if he could fix the shower as they didn t want to give us another room after 25min or so waiting they decided to move us as they couldn t fix the shower when we were moving to the new room we asked the manager if the kitchen was aware of the change of rooms and his answers was yes we waited and waited for the food and nothing i called the reception to complain and check where the food was a few times the food arrived 1 15am and cold by that time we received the food we were annoyed and tired so we called reception again and told them that the food was cold nothing was done by the hotel manager so we ended up not eating the cold pizza and the salad never arrived they said they didn t have any salad left ,0
 the location the room and the service ,1
 the croissants was so nice n tats al we can eat not many foods we can eat there because not halal n because we are muslims the room was clean beautifull n the beds r very comfortable n all the staffs are very helpfull n friendly especially johann the front desk s staff we really enjoyed our stay at pullman paris thank you ,1
 everything,0
 really enjoyed our stay pleased with the room and service excellent facilities ,1
 all,0
 loved how it was in the perfect location,1
 nothing was too much bother for the staff i was meeting up with my sister and brother in law we had tea drinks etc in the lounge not rushed at all ,1
 manageress attitude was atrocious if it wasn t for fact at conference there at 8 in morning would have walked out will never stay there again in process of complaining about attitude and rooms given as not as described on booking,0
 the room is too small uncomfortable beds electricity was shutdown every morning for 4 days the windows are facing a wall,0
 the rooms are compact which is not unusual for london they were however well kept clean and modern with everything you need it s perfectly placed for exploring london s tourist attractions ,1
 the room was very nice the location easy access into the 02 was perfect ,1
 the location is excerlent,1
 location,1
 easy access from paddington to central london,1
 staff were incredibly attentive ,1
 everything about this boutique hotel was wonderful the breakfast was delicious and fresh each morning all staff incredibly friendly and helpful also very welcoming and sweet with our daughter within about 30 minutes of arriving i already wanted to extend our stay the beds were so comfortable and the area so calm it felt like we got a genuine insight into parisian day to day life also there are so many off the beaten track sights to see close by definitely recommend looking into those we also walked to the baticlan area which was really great also there s a bakery very close by with delicious in house made produce and a great pizza restaurant just 5 minutes walk from the hotel the owner so lovely and fantastic food too can t wait to return ,1
 unfortunately i found a big bug in my room i thought it came through the window because i had left open the whet some fresh air i slept the first night the next day in the morning i found another one i collected and shared with the stuff they called the manager but she didn t even wanted to talk to me on the phone for an apology i left the hotel of course also the stuff is not well trained and very poor in english at the concierge one of the stuff didn t know the differences between j and g while i was trying to give a postal code i don t recommend this hotel for many reasons also when you check in they want you to pay in advance for the whole amount which seemed very unusual when i wanted my money back they cut the 80 of the night they didn t seemed sorry at all ,0
 bed was very comfy close to tram stops,1
 staff very polite and helpful nice clean hotel good locatation value for money,1
 not clean no changes of towels bathroom accessories etc there was tea but no teapot no english channels,0
 i have never encountered such bad staff i booked a total of seven rooms and our flight was delayed so they called my colleague at 2am to see if we were still taking the rooms also one of the group paid a cash deposit and we were unable to change this to a credit card deposit during the stay for no reason at all literally the worst service ever ,0
 the location was simply excellent the hotel is close to a major metro line and you can reach any part of the city easily the staff was as well exceptionally kind and helpful loved the hotel style old english style ,1
 where to start staff were useless we didn t get complimentary water in our room or slippers or robes soundproofing is dreadful we called down twice at midnight over 600 per night your paying for location rather go elsewhere ,0
 they charged for every little staff for which we asked for ,0
 great value for money ,1
 the staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay i arrived 4 hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a 30 hour journey from australia i didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until 2 hours after their advertised check in time i was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags the toilet floor was covered in urine it was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel ,0
 what a difference since my previous stay in the summer my room was like a shoebox the wardrobe was taken up by the hotel s bathrobe which when i transferred it to the bathroom meant i had to go into it sideways room was so small when you used the loo you knocked the loo roll off its holder most of the mini bar was placed on the bedside cabinet i had to place my small case on the desk chair and left a lot in it as i couldn t find a drawer immediately complained but told nothing could be done that day as the hotel was full i was told i could move on the following day which i declined due to time constraints in fact i was so upset by everything i booked an early flight home the same day which cost me over a 100 they still charged me for the second night which i didn t think was the best public relations move as i certainly would not use this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone else a big thank you to the hotel manager who was too busy with a meeting at the other end of the reception to speak to me personally ,0
 4 star hotel no way only 2 towels in the bathroom for 2 persons door had a hole near the lock and din t look very stable ,0
 the attention to detail provided by the staff at all levels the courtesy they offer where nothing is too much trouble for them the comfort of the beds and the provision of slippers and towelling robes denotes real quality the room rates are excellent for such good service in a central london location we always choose this hotel when coming to london because it cannot be bettered ,1
 the room was shabby for the expectations of a quality brand two lights and the trouser press reported to the concierge were not repaired the carpet was stained in several places and the furniture was damaged in two places ,0
 super tiny room for 3 very noisy traffic from outside slum kind location safety box broken fan broken chairs broken very very dirty houskeeping didn t add toilet paper even when asked continantal brekfast was an joke ,0
 the place is overpriced for the type of room you get if you are single you are better off in a hostel you will get a better accommodation there the rooms have no air conditioning and are closed off from air making it very hot in the rooms and uncomfortable the beds are saggy and are worse than some hostels not what i would expect from a so called 3 or 4 star hotel i would avoid this place,0
 staff not helpful cleanliness not good air conditioning unit in room very noisy did not work well extractor in bathroom not working irregular supply of hot water kept going boiling hot then cold did complain to staff at desk very noisy doors constantly slamming on one day had to wait till 3 30pm for room to be cleaned ,0
 the hotel tried to move me to another hotel with terrible ratings because it had overbooked the hotel it took me over an hour to sort out a room for myself the room i had was right above the street so therefor very noisy there were no sheers in the room so i had to close the blinds completely which didn t allow enough light the soap bars were cut in half obviously an attempt to save money the shower didn t work ,0
 everything can t wait to stay again would definitely recommend this hotel would use this brand in other locations,1
 the receptionist did not find our reservation and would not call booking for us at 01 00 in the night gave us a hard time we had to call and email afte midnight and we had to book new reservation but at the end he was wrong rooms are very old window broken in too so it became noisy with the train running under the property one restaurant 1 hour to receive our food very little stuff for so many guests ,0
 i am very fond of bayswater location breakfast was ok and serving and cleaning tables was quick ,1
 the room was a lovely size and included all the equipment that might be needed through my stay i e ironing board and iron the hotel itself is in a good location and exceeded my expectations for a holiday inn it was really clean and comfortable and i fully enjoyed my stay ,1
 very helpful staff great location for a good price ,1
 excellent service room was spacious clean and very comfortable staff were so friendly and helpful excellent location for o2 breakfast was exceptional ,1
 from now on this will be our choice hotel when visiting london great place great location ,1
 everthing the staff was so bad,0
 crappy rooms crappy service crappy hotel don t go there,0
 nothing everything was fine,0
 excellent staff great attitude to customers,1
 from arrival to leaving it was picture perfect staff was exceptional with a special mention for customer relations manager pauline most dog friendly hotel we ve stayed in the upgrade to our room was the cherry on the cake for a memorable stay at the heart of paris we will definitely come back ,1
 no curtains in room and staff very unhelpful when told about them told we should have complained the night before but we did not notice as it was late when we got to the room staff refused to deal with the complaint ,0
 stayed here a year ago and if anything standards are even higher than before friendly efficient staff spacious comfortable well equipped room spotlessly clean in a peaceful central location ,1
 reception staff could not locate my booking and took an hour to rebook me before i could finally go to my room ,0
 clean and comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful staff ,1
 the room layout location of the hotel staff very friendly and helpful,1
 1 the bed was the worst i ve ever slept in it was lumpy and had springs stabbing your back you could even hear the springs move while laying on the bed i booked a double bed and received two twin beds pushed together and there was a huge gap in the middle also on of the twin beds was higher than the other 2 they don t dust the back of the nightstand was all dusty and gross when i went to plug my phone in 3 the cleaning ladies knocked on our door every day at 9am to clean even on saturday and sunday seriously people come home late those days and sleep in 4 the hallway had bugs sitting all over the walls it was gross another thing about the hallways is the hotel is like a weird maze 5 the location sucked especially because of construction ,0
 room was lovely bar was really good everything was good staff where great everything was really great will stay again,1
 great staff great location quite clean and charming lovely rooms and common spaces ,1
 great location close to waterloo and then an easy and comfortable walk via westminster whitehall to the west end very enjoyable ,1
 kind staff,1
 everything was great clean and new good breakfast the works are still on but it was not a problem,1
 friendley staff and good wine,1
 the staff were really helpful amazing with our 2 children in both the bar area restaurant the hotel was clean well maintained in all areas that we visited we were upgraded too which was absolutely fantastic made our stay even better ,1
 perfect hotel in london the view is spetacular esp from the bar the hotel to stay if you want to attend an event at the o2 arena you reach the arena thru a special hallway fantastic ,1
 the fact that the staff lied about my room i booked a double bed for my other half and me got two single mattresses pushed together which done my back in worst night sleep,0
 very disappointed we booked the hotel based on the photos on their website we were put up in a third floor apartment two streets away very basic decor nothing like the website photo s no porter in our building and no lights working in the apartment thankfully we only booked for one night ,0
 close to westminster and short walk to underground,1
 location,1
 hyde park and public transport are in close proximity we used bayswater station everyday staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes the pub across the street is great the room is small but probably good for value because of price and location ,1
 service,0
 lovely reception bar and breakfast staff very friendly,1
 room very spacious bed very comfortable staff seemed very friendly very clean and tidy throughout would definitely recommend ,1
 a very comfortable and nice room a perfect boutique hotel,1
 alarm went off at 2 00 in the morning for about an hour we weren t told why or how long it would last for when we were sufficiently frozen outside and realised that there was no fire we made our way back in ,0
 head board of the beds were soft nice wet room ,1
 dated bedroom bathroom smelt musty no towels used soap very noisy bar with aggressive intimidating clientele view from the room of dlr track great if you like train spotting would not go back under any circumstances,0
 enjoyed our stay here it was nice and clean the staff were very friendly great hospitality would definitely recommend this to family and friends the location is great too easy to get around to other tourist attractions parks shopping places ,1
 so small and facility is really old,0
 not very clean there were stones in the toilet when we arrived dusty surfaces and bathroom smelt of smoke slow wifi 0 80mb,0
 this is my fifth time staying at this hotel it is my home away from home excellent service with central location but still quiet and and oasis of peace love everything about it ,1
 the hotel location is excellent and the building is stunning inside and out the staff were accommodating and very pleasant as always the breakfast special offer was also a good bonus plus the fact we could leave our luggage with the concierge as our room wasn t ready and we didn t return until 11 30 was a real comfort it was lovely to be able to sit in the bar with a glass of wine and unwind after a very hectic day ,1
 lovely hotel ,1
 like jerry seinfeld said i don t think you do you see you know how to take the reservation you just don t know how to hold the reservation and that s really the most important part of the reservation the holding anybody can just take them i entered the hotel late at night to find that the room i have reverted was taken without any notification im pretty sure they would have changed my fully if it would not have come at all ,0
 dear sir madam i am writing to complain about my stay in your hotel on the 22nd and 23rd of february room 14 it was an implied term of our contract that the accommodation provided would be of a good standard and reasonable quality however there was no warm water and i stayed without a shower over my stay in your hotel although i have complained to the reception but nothing was done as such i would like to be compensited for the above reason mentioned above i will require a response at your earliest convenience please yours sincerely salah,0
 to be honest i was disgusted with the hotel my friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke tempted to ask for my money back ,0
 excellent service venue design friendly welcoming and informative spacious and modern great views of the city ,1
 the room was really hot and air con just seemed to blow out hot air our room key didn t work had to visit reception 3 times before it was sorted this took awhile when you are on the 7th floor wouldn t go there again ,0
 we had gluten free breakfast they had separate toaster for gluten free breads but i can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet otherwise i can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast i just could not eat it still for sure i could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast enough for a big man it was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel ,1
 poor service levels ,0
 nothing i like,0
 vet nice staff love staying here,1
 free use of mobile phone in the room is a excellent bonus club sandwich on the brunch menu was superb ,1
 the location was great,1
 the decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible,1
 couldn t open windows for fresh air dusty room stuffy warm rooms old fashioned decor,0
 every thing,0
 location design coziness street view park opposite of the hotel specialty coffee around the corner with nice english speaking staff free wi fi in the hotel calm and relaxing atmosphere ,1
 location and view was perfect,1
 the aircondition was leaking and thereby dripping on the spotligt below which was rusty there is an increased possibility of ignition and fire with such an failure whichwe told them they did react profesional and said they would check it imidiately but it should not be noticed randomly by two fire safety engineering phd students they shoud have noticed it themself the beds were hopeless and the room was furnished as it in the 90 s,0
 good breakfast quality small room but comfortable on the fifth floor quiet ,1
 the shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster the room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges the bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare the stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids you definitely get what you pay for it was half clean and not very central,0
 warm welcome and recognition of my birthday room decorated and nice bottle of wine ,1
 the staff were exceptional as were the facilities we had the most amazing meal with one meal being cooked to order to accommodate allergies would recommend visiting the 18th floor to have a cocktail or two the views were incredible can t recommend enough ,1
 everything is ok location is excellent comfortable i like this place see you next time ,1
 just a few steps away from the o2 ,1
 helpful friendly staff cleanliness,1
 wine and chocolates on arrival for birthday ,1
 everything,0
 comfortable beds good room heating,1
 rip off if you book via booking agency they charge you for wifi or get you to upgrade to a better room couldn t get s feather pillow wifi didn t work the so called upgraded breakfast wasn t good staff didn t care at all,0
 was promised a queen bed instead got 2 very uncomfortable singles torn sheets dirty toilet rim mould in shower i booked via booking com at 330 per night a colleague of mine booked a second room on the same day as i booked he booked over the phone at 189 including breakfast ,0
 the room was amazing value for money plenty of room to spread out for a young family self contained kitchenette was handy for a long stay ,1
 nice central setting very friendly staff warm comfortable room and excellent breakfast ,1
 poor room poor service ,0
 excellent decor in the rooms and we ll equipped they gave my husband a small gift for his special birthday ,1
 room maids were rude,0
 excelllent view out to cleveland square quiet extremely helpful staff at all times of day and evening good furnishings of room 317 good magazine supply nice atmosphere in lounge bar above all the excellent room and its fittings mind the ingenuity of the designer in fitting so much into the space of 317 made it a very different experience than staying in one of the larger upgraded room suites of my last stay there both are fine just radically different ,1
 teribble experience needed a twin room which they didn t provide until night 2 toilet was blocked 3 people came to fix it and when getting to the room they all turned around and refused to do anything because they don t do toilets and they charged me for 2 rooms which i am still trying to get a refund for,0
 we got an unexpected upgrade on check in which was amazing,1
 wonderful room very friendly staff location right besides the opera ,1
 waiting for check in for 2 hours i have checked in my room about 3 30 which i waited with my kids about more than 2 hours ,0
 location is excellent and easy to get into central london and choice of local restaurants fab staff at the hotel are friendly and accommodating rooms are spacious very comfortable and clean breakfast options excellent and bar area very comfortable and cosy big plus is underground parking at the hotel also fab experience all round ,1
 the address on this hotel stated camden when infact it was no where near camden and for someone not familiar with london this was very disappointing it should not have camden in the address when it is not as it gives people a false impression ,0
 good location traditional ambience ,1
 first hotel which checked ourselves out by themselves and discarded our belongings before checkout time simply because of their back to back bookings our passports from the safe were also taken without our permission ,0
 even though the booking indicated payment only once there the hotel took almost half the booking value a week before without notice when following up they acknowledged that this was not standard procedure and would reverse the money not realising that further losses would occur due to exchange rates very poor and unacceptable the breakfast is basic whilst the hot portion thereof is not up to scratch i e powdered eggs canned mushrooms etc the lifts are scary to say the least and it is concerning that they are operating under those conditions although there is a sauna it is never hot nor even warm it is a non feature and should perhaps just be removed or closed down even though the hotel is non smoking there is significant smoking within the hotel and nothing is done about it all in all the hotel is not value for money and should rather be avoided ,0
 i honestly couldn t have asked for a a nicer place to stay for my birthday with my partner the view was amazing and the rooms where lovely as soon as we walked through the door we where greeted by very helpful friendly staff thank you so much you made my birthday extra special ,1
 the room was dirty and small they don t tell me that money loocked for caution will be looked for 10 days when i come back in italy this is no good ,0
 i specifically booked two twins on booking com a few hotels will allow you to specifically book two twins when we got there they gave us one double i frequently travel with my daughter and girlfriends and will only book hotels that will allow specific singles booking if i had known this request would not been honoured i would have never booked it further it appears hotels have the option to not allow specific twin bookings after being offered a king bed instead in the interests of making it right and while desperately trying to rebook a hotel room at 6 pm on a saturday night in the west end of london whilst holding show tickets for 7 30 and letting them know i was unimpressed i was offered two separate rooms and moved to a room with twins the next day that room directly faces a very active new construction site with jackhammering etc starting at 0800 on checkout i was asked if i was happy with my stay i said no at this point the concierge pointed out they had given me two rooms for the first night he continued to argue the point i should have been happy sorry i had a simple request two beds i did not want to have to panic on saturday night or move on sunday i did not need the stress at the end of a multiple hotel stay vacation to deal with this i did not want to be next to a construction site even at check in before offering two rooms the check in staff argued with me about the booking process and needing to phone and confirm this is the age of computers you know how many twin rooms you have don t sell what you don t have amend your parameters on booking com advertise you are located next to an active construction site ,0
 we stayed here for our 1st wedding anniversary it was absolutely fantastic lovely staff couldn t do enough for you everything was amazing from start to finish we will definitely be back ,1
 everything the room was tired and needing a facelift long ago the reception system is out of date the breakfast looked very lack lusture and with a huge play on gross profit achievement the hilton olympia was like a typical budget hotel ,0
 facilities did not function sink was blocked something heavy fell if i had been in the room i would have been injured way overpriced for what it is ,0
 we had previously stayed at this hotel in november 2016 for my birthday and really enjoyed it therefore we booked to return back in june for my partner s birthday however our return back was awful the staff were rude and unhelpful the room was not as expected no view the layout was not as any of the pictures shown on booking com we then had to upgrade our room at an additional expense like the junior suite wasn t costing us alot of money already we will not be returning back the duty manager kuman was extremely rude and very very unhelpful we checked in around 3pm and we were in the lobby with the duty manager u ntil approx 5 30pm and nothing was being done to resolve our issue during our 2 5 hours in the lobby there were 4 other client complaints regarding their room and their stay ,0
 it was a quirky hotel in terms of innovative way they used space including the room itself and breakfast room,1
 the hotel was excellent in every way right from arrival the staff were friendly and accommodating the breakfast staff were amazing and even offered my kids pancakes which were lovely they had a variety of restaurants to choose from the facilities were top notch the hotel is right next door to the 02 less than a 4 minute walk i really enjoyed my stay and wouldn t hesitate to stay there again,1
 always high standard good location and excellent breakfast buffet nice people as well ,1
 they moved us from one hotel to another the room was ridiculously small for a deluxe doble room 2 3 days we had to come back 35 min later to have breakfast because there was no space last day bathroom lights gone loop broken all the experience on it became a joke noisy room 3 meters from reception if you read this only one advice move on to another place ,0
 waiting around as they had no booking for us and no on site parking as stated wifi didn t work decor was tired looking sliperry carpeted staircase,0
 i didn t like location the photos are no real tiny room the hotel was dirty there is so many dust in bathroom and the carpet covers a creak floor city centre is away from lancaster gate but achievable by subway only attraction is hyde park in front of the hotel,0
 i didn t like the service because there was no service and the space which supposed to be 4 stars ,0
 convenient for hammersmith tube apollo etc ,1
 the hotel is in an excellent position plenty to see do right on the doorstep great choice at breakfast the staff were helpful ,1
 me and my girlfriend booked this hotel in the treat your partner package we stayed one night but enjoyed ourselves the facilities were lovely unfortunately we missed the free breakfast as we sampled the night life in london the late check out was a lovely touch will definitely come back next year,1
 clean facility,1
 the bed was comfortable ,1
 staff were friendly and helpful room was compact but excellent location is 5 10 minute walk from paddington station,1
"super centrally located, between the zaandam central train station and the night life of zaandam and the shopping at gedempte gracht. the reception is inside an office building and the rooms are on the 11th floor. friendly service, but 10:00 check-out is rather early.",1
 location,1
 the attitude of the staff during the check in the assumption that i wanted two single beds even though i booked a double room how the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple so called technical problem with the room i wouldn t recommend staying here ,0
 i booked this hotel at 155 for the night it was a gift for my wife and mother in law and i d sent cash with them which was agreed over phone as acceptable once my wife arrived and paid they wouldn t accept cash and they charged her card 206 i ve also just called them and they can t help on a sunday thank you for ruining a good christmas present ,0
 location access,1
 bed is not comfortable sheets are dirty the bed cover is flat you have to ask for the fillings i had the worst checkout experience ever they charged me for everything even for the complementary water i had to double check everything in the bill be aware the concierge is not free we are in 2017 and they dont have free internet ,0
 room was very small with a small staircase as soon as you open the door up to where the bed felt very cramped,0
 staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful hotel the room i stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food and easy trams into central 10 mins i highly recommend ,1
 i was majorly disappointed with this hotel i arrived and found my room to be really dirty there were stains on the carpet which you can accept in a hotel but what you can t accept is finding two hairs and a pubic hair in the bed and having a throw at the end of the bed which is covered in stains i felt so uncomfortable sleeping in the hotel after this the next morning i stepped into the shower and within 20 seconds it was overflowing water going all over the bathroom floor i had to turn off the shower and was unable to properly shower when i mentioned it to reception they said i had to left the drain up on the floor before i shower to allow the water to pass through i ve never stayed in a hotel in my life where i ve had to fiddle about on the shower floor lifting drains up before i shower and if this is the case provide me with instructions in the bathroom so i know to do this when i told reception i was unhappy with my room and it was unclean they said sorry no offer to reimburse me in any form sorry doesn t really cut it ,0
 quality of room not baby friendly despite a phone call prior to booking to say it was carpet rod grippers visible and could be stood on travel cot not real cot again despite a call prior to booking to confirm it wasn t a travel cot reception staff not friendly at all ,0
 reception staff was totally disappointed ,0
 the staff were approachable and helpful they made us feel welcome on returning late it was suggested we finish the evening in the sky bar which was perfect ,1
 very few good restaurants within walking distance gym and pool were disappointing hotel breakfast was only slightly better than economy class airplane food ,0
 when i returned from the evening out the room was boiling hot i called reception and nothing was done finally at 1 30am i got up to go to reception as i could not sleep and they realised they had the room set to hot and 25c with no apology or concern for our sleep it took about another hour for the room to cool but honestly i ve stayed in holiday inns for half the price and are far better ,0
 the staff in reception,0
 no swimming pool as advertised no gym facility not child friendly poor access poor breakfast buffet choices tv channel limited,0
 location of hotel is excellent big spacious room great value for money lovely christmas feeling decorations only tiny negative i booked a room for 3 people and the room only had toiletries tea coffee cups for 2 people ,1
 staff very polite and helpful,1
 tried to put us in a room so tiny that there was not even space for our suitcases after being told twice there were no other rooms they eventually moved us to a very nice larger room ,0
 the location next to the o2 arena and the friendly staff ,1
 fantastic location hotel and staff,1
 bathroom was dirty apple tv was faulty too late at night to care or try and get it fixed booked a room with breakfast only to be told i had not and tried to charge me for it charged service in the bar in the evening automatically added to the bill and refused to remove it when i have stood at the bar to order the drinks and carried them back to my table myself bad service again from the hilton wont come back out of choice ,0
 asked for a premier room with double bed with a bathtub received a room with two single beds pushed together ,0
 i have no idea very deceptive very different with your detail i arrived too lately that room was too big with one double bed and one single bed at the corner very far away from room to elevator i made a reservation for me one single small room nearby elevator first floor but i found very different with photos because of my big heavy broken down luggage,0
 nice room good breakfast amazing position for the o2,1
 the room was not heated very cold in the nights staff not engaged ,0
 staff were extrememly helpful and polite room was a little cramped but cozy loved that we had a bathtub to soak in after being out in the cold all day ,1
 beatiful atmosphere,1
 location,1
 the room had a few oddities there is no mini bar there is an ice bucket ice machines on the ground floor along with two glasses there are no water bottles in the room there is a kettle for tea and coffee though when we wanted drinks we of course consulted the in room menus ah no drinks apart from tea and coffee on the menu tap water only how absurd so if you re a fan of ice do stay here and use that very thoughtful ice bucket and maybe even take it down to the bar that the staff assured us was open till 1am but was in fact closed by 12 15 and supply your own ice for what i m sure will be very average mimosas we also booked a balcony room we got a juliette balcony room with a view of the river but not a balcony just an open window with a railing in front of it the bathroom was dingy and the shower head cocked to the right the hotel is a maze of corridors when i asked for directions to my room from a porter he explained that there are 6th floors everywhere and then proceeded in telling me a very homer esque set of directions to the room it was an odyssey to be sure the location is good for exploring the lovely greenland docks rotherhithe and canary wharf with free tickets for the ferry but that s all the rest of the hotel is a bore it s average to the extreme and missing so many key features of any good modern hotel that it really feels like stepping back in time oh wait no there s a very modern vending machine close to the lobby but alas no drinks just condoms and toothpaste presumably for the working clientele who can t make it home because of the late meeting ,0
 i am sure i rated this experience previously however to reiterate my partner amanda and i found the intercontinental 02 truly wonderful we chose the option of club lounge access and although we did not have the time to take full advantage of its tremendous facilities on our next visit we certainly will the spa was superb the big bonus for us was the staff were par excellence nothing was to much trouble thank you once again and we very much look forward to our next visit tom madden,1
 1 rooms were smaller then a prison cell 2 invest in some air conditioning boiling hot 3 had to have a very warm shower as the showers were broken 4 receptionist wouldn t let us check into our rooms unless all our guests we re present we booked 2 rooms as one was a surprise for the birthday boy she was rude until we explained the situation 5 rooms were not ready by the time we got there and this was at 6 pm 6 bed was very small and uncomfortable 7 definitely a waste of 380 00 for 2 rooms wouldn t even pay 50 00 for both the rooms,0
 the facilities in the room the location was close to where we needed it to be and the staff were really helpful ,1
 air con didn t work shower head was loose run out off wine and beer meant to be a double room ended up being to single beds poorly spoken english speaking staff ,0
 i stayed at many hotels in 2016 and i never wrote a review before but because of the appalling stay i had at this hotel i decide to rate my experience which was horrible first the room was booked for someone else whose name were on the screen but they gave it to us for some reasons we didnt get second the room we had was freezing and we couldn t increase the temp at night the wind was below through the window like ac never had night like this before in all hotels we stayed in and what made it worst is the staff were so rude in the next morning when we asked them if we can get one night refund because we left the hotel second day even though we paid for two night unbelievable experience so bad ,0
 the rooms were very comfortable with beautiful modern decor great lighting robes iron drinks and a cracking bed the hotel is set back slightly from fleet st in its own courtyard and it has a modern bar and a well appointed gym the staff were excellent as was the breakfast ,1
 it was our 40th wedding anniversary and we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room chocolates in the room and a free drink at the bar lovely welcome touch the location is superb,1
 loved the d cor cleanliness and ambience,1
 staff not friendly not helpful microwave not functioning shower cubicle flooded drain pipe stuck air conditioner not cold at all and water keep dripping fr the a c breakfast lousy only bread butter ,0
 my first room had a broken shower and terrible view so i was moved the spa facilities were very below standard and treatments such as massages unavailable these facilities were my only reason for booking this hotel in the first place,0
 2 minutes walk from kensignton park and hyde park about 40 minutes walk from the main shops at oxford street staff all very friendly different restaurants and shops in the street behind the hotel ,1
 club lounge very nice view was nice as well,1
 i did not like being charged for the same room twice and not being able to get a refund of either the hotel or booking com both blaming the other party ,0
 really nice location and very clean hotel and rooms reception were very friendly,1
 it was in a good location with a easy easy reach of the train station ,1
 the bed was rather hard but ok the breakfast had rather small variety of selections and the breakfast room was icy cold ,0
 dirty carpets paid extra for a room with a window to only see construction site ,0
 loved the decor surprisingly modern with some lovely quirky details,1
 staff very friendly and helpful location perfect for getting anywhere we needed to go in paris and decor of the hotel was cool ,1
 facilities were very poor we booked especially for a spa break in the light of the swimming pool and sauna etc very disappointed by what we discovered swimming pool was more like a paddling pool and no way deep enough to swim and the sauna steam room very basic all round no luxury and was very average ,0
 nice modern hotel with excellent facilities and staff ,1
 the room are very small the bathrooms are awful and very old fashion the furniture are deppressive and the whole price does not worth it it is overated i guess and i won t ever repeat my experience,0
 very tiny rooms,0
 the beds was so comfy great nights sleep the bathroom luxurious brilliant views the staff was so helpful nothing was too much trouble,1
 we were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked the room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening ,0
 none,0
 staff was unfriendly and insincere the rooms were tiny the triple was just a normal size room with a bad quality roll away bed matress was uncomfortable on the bed the closet doors were falling off ,0
 the staff receptions,0
 balcony door did not lock bedroom door would not shut wind was whilstling through the room complained got an upgrade all rooms are dated and old fashioned not worth the money needs a revamp ,0
 breakfast is excellent good choice and offer porridge which is always a bonus staff recognised that we had stayed before and welcomed us back waiting staff at breakfast were very attentive bath towels were beautifully white and fluffy bed comfy and the room was spotless the room had a beautiful view of the gardens this is why we came back ,1
 the staff were delightful and made us feel special everyone was equally friendly yet unobtrusive,1
 as above,0
 very comfortable bed excellent breakfast including veggie sausages and well stocked bar ,1
 excellent conferencing facilities,1
 lovely hotel which was clean and comfortable with excellent security and customer service ,1
 i paid for a double room instead i had a twin single with a folded out sofa leaving no room to walk in the room i was given no warning nor compensation for this change the baths hot water was cold,0
 friendly staff quiet location good value clever storage facilities in room convenient to restaurants transport ,1
 the breakfast buffet was fantastic the building is wonderful and the hotel is well situated ,1
 bad service 2 days without cold water in the shower impossible to keep under boiling water staff gave us no solution,0
 the staff were extremely professional friendly and helpful ,1
 location n its service,1
 the room was filthy and no one cleaned it plug sockets didn t work and staff walking in and out the room all day,0
 they had a very comfortable bar lounge where i was able to have business meetings they were one tube stop from paddington station where the heathrow express terminates in london,1
 bed was high which was good lots of pillows lovely staff very close to queensway tube overall very good,1
 we arrived early before checkin time the hotel was notified before they offered us an early checkin for additional charge that we paid immediately but we found out the room is a single occupancy one the bed was too small for two we notified them and they said our room is not going to be ready and we either accept this smaller one downgrade or upgrade for another charge for the duration of our stay we asked for what we paid for they kept saying it s not available due to new year time frustratingly i went online and found the same room type available and offered to guests eventually we accepted the paid upgrade and paid the additional daily charge our reservation was inclusive of breakfast during the paid early checkin they said we can t use the breakfast on that day as breakfast starts from the next day we weren t even thinking about it but we found it very wearied during checkout we asked for help to carry the luggage and nobody came without even a simple apology the receptionists were mostly unfriendly ,0
 we had a large corner room with balcony and were within easy walking distance of metro saint ambroise 9 line and 69 bus which goes to many of the major attractions hotel was very clean and staff was helpful breakfast buffet was relatively inexpensive and included all the basics coffee juice croissants cheese hard boiled eggs cereal yogurt jam fruit ,1
 location,1
 wifi was very patchy staff could not find my reservation for the longest time when i was checking in the property was very inflexible about making any modifications to my booking even when the request was made well in advance of the actual booking,0
 bathroom door lock stuck closed and handle didn t open the door for ages room 414 also shower mixer does not work so had really hot shower as couldn t turn it down ,0
 very uncomfortable room very hot and miserable no ventilation or air conditioning e mail manger but never responded,0
 location,1
 location was perfect for our theatre visit and sightseeing very close to bus and underground staff were very helpful especially at breakfast in the bar when restaurant was crowded ,1
 wasn t very clean,0
 they didn t allow me to take pictures they said because i had a pro camera if i was taking with my iphone was ok the room was nice but very small and the ac was not working good the assistant manger was so rude she was treating us like guest we really felt bad the manger was kind and understanding ,0
 very convenient location for our onward journey through st pancras ,1
 we were made to move hotels because of hot water issues the mattress was yellow with stains if i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room i was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned the headboard was stained the staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control a second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge ,0
 it is far most of the staff are not friendly or helpful internet was down several times phone was out of order rooms are very small it is not value for money disadvantages are numerous to count ,0
 quiet room slept very well ,1
 staff very polite and helpful much better approach to customer service than their heathrow hotel would definitely recommend 5 10 10 experience i used to visit park grand heathrow but no more after staying at the paddington hotel,1
 old decoration no minibar noisy at nighy because windows not closing properly ac not working for heating ,0
 staff facilities toilets dirty,0
 friendly helpful staff immaculate room comfortable bed good lighting,1
 the beds and the staff,1
 air conditioner was broke and was told the technician wasn t available until 9am i asked about changing rooms getting a fan or if anything else can be done the response from the front desk was to open a window they refused to do anything or even send an employee up to look at it ,0
 miserable hotel ,0
 heating got stuck on 32 during the night 2am phoned down to reception only to be told we could only get it turned off not down if they sent someone from maintenance we finally got to sleep at 3am only to be woken by a truck delivering the clean linen to the hotel no bath only a shower with only one flannel and one hand bath towel ,0
 the value you receive for the price is disappointing ,0
 bed was so comfy and the location in front of this very quiet green square was great ,1
 heating only a few hours a day and sheets changed every three days plaster covering wall and ceiling not painted over no wifi on top floor,0
 the hotel damaged my personal property and is taking a very slow and convoluted process to fix it i expect a better service from a radisson blu hotel ,0
 the treatment of the receptionist and personals at breakfast was unacceptable the rooms are very very small everything was really bad except location ,0
 everything harry potter experience ,0
 i didn t like anything in this hotel all things were terrible except one receptionist called kavin and the reception manager ,0
 there was no one to help us wth our luggage when we arrived we were very tired naturally after a 24 hour flight but had to carry out cases up four flights of stairs dirty bathroom with mould curtains falling off rods crooked lampshades no one knew what was going on at reception first we were told breakfast was included then it wasn t we rang for s bottle opener as the drinks in mini bar needed a bottle opener must only be one in whole hotel as the man waited while we opened bottle and took it away also we rang and requested an extra glass but never received it it was bit like fawlty towers ,0
 the staff were lovely the breakfast was good and the room though small was clean and pleasant,1
 room elevator,0
 location perfect breakfast good selection staff friendly,1
 the room was lovely extremely spacious and with a balcony the club lounge was a great touch well stocked with food and drinks all the staff were very helpful and keen to make sure everything was to our liking,1
 great location with sights shopping and the city in walking distance excellent discount from the standard rate through booking com the hotel itself has lots of character difficult to beat at the price paid on this occasion ,1
 location comfort easy access staff friendliness lovely rooms spacious child friendly ,1
 it s the worst night ever in the hotel it was under construction when i arrived even though i booked it 2 months ago booking com did t notice it to me no ac in july moreover i could not open the window because of the poisonous smell from outside i am very upset about the hotel opening in that bad condition indeed i am more upset with booking com which didn t notice it i want to get a full refund for my last night in paris ,0
 beware tiny rooms booked deluxe double but was initially given a compact double where you couldn t even walk around one side of the bed after complaining and having to show my booking com confirmation they upgraded to a slightly bigger room but under no circumstances wouldl i describe it as a deluxe ,0
 price of room ridiculous getting charged for breakfast even at discounted price was daylight robbery size of room small and cramped dominated by huge tv bed seemed short in length shower soaked bathroom floor noisy room very little daylight in room,0
 first thing we got an upgrade from a room to a suite which was very nice staff was helpful real beautiful bar with terrific looking bar menu cocktails a lot of attractions of london in walking distance ,1
 help from staff in a medical emergency ,1
 upgraded room for a relatively cheap price on the day of arrival got a penthouse suit with balcony overlooking the london eye and river fantastic stay ,1
 location staff,1
 room was too hot air con did not work asked reception to send maintenance who just opened the windows second time of asking nobody showed up uncomfortable nights sleep no water in the room room service charged 13 00 for two 1 litre bottles of still mineral water total rip off hotel looks tired decor very old and out dated compared with the surrounding locations reception staff friendly but breakfast staff rude and obviously have undergone no customer training one waiter removed my orange juice from the table before i had finished and took plates while i was still eating toast coming down in the lift cleaner entered with a hoover then answered a phone call and was being very loud and inconsiderate would not move out of the way when i need to exit the lift with my bag and made it awkward very rude and not what you would expect in any customer service establishment breakfast was not great either more like faulty towers than anything else would not recommend this hotel at all ,0
 very old building and rooms needs renovation as soon as possible rooms are outdated and uncomfortable no free parking air conditioner is noisy and old poor soundproofing ,0
 comfy bed helpful staff nice food overall great,1
 i ve stayed here a few times now and always find it comfortable and welcoming great location access to kings cross dickens museum restaurants and british library not far walk from these places ,1
 beautiful old world charm of hotel,1
 the staff were excellent particularly the night manager who handled a breakdown in our bathroom really well in the end relocating us to a different hotel with the same chain and providing complimentary airport transfers very pleased with the service ,1
 receptionist attitude was outrageous,0
 friendly staff comfortable room nice building,1
 friendly staff,1
 room small and in basement asked to be moved room not very clean extra blankets filthy phone didn t work ,0
 fabulous hotel fantastic staff we had breakfast this time which was amazing so much choice we ll be getting it next time we go can t wait to go back again soon,1
 my stay was made stressful due to almost every member of staff being not to a standard this type of hotel should have day before arrival i rang 5 times to confirm my booking even the duty manager wasn t able to until a heated argument started then they felt they had to make an effort heh presto they found it calls that where promised to be returned after investigation never came went on from 10am in the morning to 5 30pm in the evening after departing i had 2 x follow up calls due to my complaints from managers who couldn t even get my name right i then got follow up emails addressing me by a different name the breakfast was terrible being served simply scrambled eggs on toast the toast only 1 slice was served 20 min before the eggs asking for more warm toast it never arrived after 1 hr i left went elsewhere for breakfast that was after being charged 23 on a follow up for this complaint the f b manager told me the toaster was faulty he would buy me a drink in the bar if i ever returned to their hotel which i won t the mini bar was totally empty in the bedroom but i had to leave a deposit by card on reception at point of check in so made me worry i was going to be charged will be checking my bank statements after 9 days after departure my invoice from them as requested for final bills has still not been received when ordering room service at the bar to be sent up i had to explain 3 times to the bar tender as he couldn t grasp the fact i wanted it in the room not in the bar i could go on on but i think anyone reading would be fed up by that point very very disappointed in the standard of staff particularly management i was only there 2 nights ,0
 i didnt like the treatment of the staff working in this hotel they predent that they are 5 star hotel but unfortunately the staff working dosent show that comparing to other 5 star hotels this the worst i have ever stay on even 4 star hotels better than this hotel before i visit we have tried to cancel our trip for but they refused we requested also to evacuate the fridge and they wanted to charge us 20 pounds and i have never heared all around the world any hotel charge for evacuating the fridge as they said a new policy rude stuff,0
 some of amenities towels and glasses were always not settled during my stay i had to ask roomkeeper to bring those stuff i didn t stay in such an unorganized room in any other 5 star hotels plus reception was not so kind ,0
 room size customer service and all above ,0
 the pillows were a bit lumpy and could do with a couple of extras ,0
 stunning stunning stunning hotel decor was room decor even swimming pool decor was beautifully designed excellent and professional staff attention to detail handwritten welcome note chocolates and gorgeous smelling kit kemp bathroom goodies,1
 superb rooms staff service food ambience ,1
 the building was spectacular inside and out the staff were very friendly and efficient the room was to a high standard and the food was out of this world ,1
 room wasn t ready at 3pm waited for over an hour room was small and the decoration felt tired,0
 i had a very pleasant staying the room was clean and offered everything i needed the building is beautiful personnel was very nice and helpful the position is extremely convenient ,1
 the entire bedroom,0
 the room corridor of the hotel did not have central heating or they had a problem because the room was very cold we asked the receptionist they installed a small heater which plugs in which i thought was very poor especially the standard price of the room the breakfast is terrible please please do not purchase there breakfast because its shocking cold horrible very disappointed we both were ,0
 smell of foist in annexe coridors which a member of staff agreed with the rooms extremeley small wanted to leave but was told they would debt my visa account they finally upgraded us to a larger room this spoilt our evening and the start of our once in a lifetime holiday on board the orient express ,0
 staff has no idea about hospitalety except the location nothing is good,0
 small rooms with no space and very poor lighting not ideal if on business trip ,0
 lovely staff and great breakfast,1
 staff very friendly good location right beside hyde park and one minute walk from queensway tube station on the central line very clean rooms just a bit small ,1
 terrible room size of a cupboard heater stuck on on so unbearably hot no desk awkward bathroom and very very noisy,0
 i booked a single room which was almost the same price of the couple room the given room so tight as i couldn t even turn around i bet jail would be more convenient to stay i advice everybody to check the room space before booking ,0
 good location close to train station easy walk to oxford street bathroom was great very modern ,1
 the hotel room was very cold and noise i could not sleep at all my air conditioning did not work i was keep asking the reception guy but nothing was sorted terrible hotel i will never come back very disappointed taking in account the room price was quite expensive ,0
 the booking was for a young couple the couple were given a tiny room they asked to empty the mini bar and were told that this would involve a charge of 50 pounds after complaing they said that they would waive the charge but then didnt empty the mini bar they also moaned about booking com customers ,0
 location staff the way they treat their client ,0
 all perfect will definatly return,1
 menu very limited and didn t offer much incentive to eat there,0
 the staff on the reception desk are polite but painfully slow we were initially allocated a room that bore no resemblance to the description on booking com we returned to reception to be greeted yet again with a long queue too few staff and another painful wait finally we were given another room slightly better but it didn t match the criteria that we d booked this whole situation had taken far too long we were due at another appointment for a very specific time and were late the reception desk is the front line they should be reassuring alert and quick the staff here at doubletree docklands are non of these we have stayed at other doubletree hotels and had a wonderful experience and that s why we chose this one think very carefully about booking this hotel it s nowhere near the standard of the others ,0
 very warm and friendly reception who assisted us in any way we needed ,1
 very clean and safe ,1
 woke on saturday morning to no water no way to wash flush take meds make tea breakfast was served boring english buffet lack of fruit yoghurts etc somehow it sounds like this has happened before the electrics in the street go out so no water pump staff seemed pretty oblivious and unconcerned kept saying it d be on in half an hour manager refused to reduce our bill by any more than 25 regardless of the fact that we had to leave for our function unwashed very unhappy ,0
 this hotel is one of the worst hotels i have stayed in for some time the room was tiny and very hot the a c did not work properly the restaurant was dreadful almost inedible pizza the car park was like some kind of building site everywhere was tatty and in need of refurbishment i ve known hotel stays at budget hotels better than this not good enough ,0
 love the location the history of the building the breakfast,1
 the staff were really friendly and the breakfast in the morning was the best i ve ever had ,1
 very noisy unable to sleep,0
 when we arrived in the room all we could hear was loud drilling above us to the point we went out and was then woken up at 9am on the saturday morning again to loud drilling above us so again we went out we could have been made aware of this when we checked in ,1
 i did not get what i asked for i send like 5 mails and called the hotel 2 times to be sure that my room is with a view of the eiffel tower and then they tell me that they sold out,0
 staff very polite and helpful room small with limited storage but it was billed as a compact double and it didn t matter for one night i used the small gym there was no one else in it walk to hyde park in ten to fifteen minutes would book again ,1
 room big but very cold windows single glazed didn t close properly floor slightly worn fabricated planks no carpet bathroom not clean sink grubby and blocked shower hose leaking badly these were addressed after complaint but the work created a leak in the sink waste that then dropped into the waste bin not good enough for 220 quid per night ,0
 the view from the room was lovely closeness to the 02 made our visit unflustered ,1
 very helpful polite and friendly staff was my husband s birthday so they left a card wine soft drinks and popcorn for the children ,1
 the poor state of decor terrible bed and awful bathroom peeling paint on walls ,0
 breakfast was very good bedroom very comfortable hotel just off the boulevard st germaine near notre dame not close to a lot of tourist attractions but reasonable wslking distance ,1
 the room was very quiet considering we were in central london the hotel is tucked away in a courtyard which is nice very comfortable bed very nice walk in shower the location of the hotel is excellent easy 20 minute walk to convent garden or st paul s cathedral or embankment to catch a boat along the thames ,1
 old furnure value it s expensive wifi,0
 the room was lovely clean and comfortable breakfast good variety and pleasent atmosphere ,1
 the tv and phone in my room was not working despite several complain the hotel choose to ignore i end up changing my hotel for the rest of my stay ,0
 very good hotel lovely room lovely shower ,1
 we had a fantastic stay at the k k george very easy access to earls court tube which goes straight to heathrow as well as being a great start to explore london easily quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in room was very comfortable and well serviced breakfast had lots of choice really a lovely base for a holiday in london ,1
 location old fittings old showers unconfortable mattress i left an item behid i called and asked for it but nothing happened as they were suppose to investigate and call me back but nothing happened ,0
 this was our first time in amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful they took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly ,1
 amazing bed setting great coffee and tea facilities really enjoyed our stay here after the check in ,1
 the place is dirty there s mold in the bathroom the noise from the plumbing is very loud at all hours the kitchen staff woke us up at 6am both days the rest of the staff is no friendly they wouldn t move our room ,0
 the presence of the building the history location was great for us the staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome the bar was quite nice too when full and busy with other guests ,1
 every thing was so bad first the receptionist was so rude and unhelpful the size of the room is too small every thing is small the bed and sofa was uncomfortable actually it s not worth the money this is the worst experience i had in my life ,0
 the whole experience in one word the smell in the reception is like old cooking it is very noisy ,0
 impressive old historical building in excellent location,1
 we have booked for 2 nights when we arrive around 20 00 they have gave us a room which was 1 floor under the heating was not working as also the tv when we told them about the problems the receptionist who was in the afternoon shift has replied that he will take care of it when we came back after 3 hours nothing was working too when i call the reception again the afternoon shift had left and the night shift came and fix the problems the only point which measure to my opinion to rate the hotel with a better rate than zero was this guy who was very helpful after our complaints they moved us to a higher level 1st floor next day but a very smaller room thank god next day we left early in the morning the fotos in booking com are not even close to the reality ,0
 comfy bed with lovely sheets and duvet good shower,1
 very pleasant and friendly boutique hotel,1
 great location for apollo,1
 staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us no argument bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant ,1
 the hotel room was way over priced considering and completely misrepresented by its description the bed was described as a queen which by no means it was my boyfriend was woke early by sunlight through the curtains which wouldn t shut properly the breakfast was poor and pastries provided stale but by far the my biggest dislike is the poor way of charging for room rate the hotel ended up charging me twice i wouldn t recommend staying here and felt disppointed for my boyfriend who i had booked this stay as a christmas present ,0
 staff mood,0
 the whole experience will come bk when in london staff made my mums bday very special,1
 rooms are cozy and quiet breakfast and meals are great ,1
 housekeeping very rude very unhelpful very non responsive all outsourced not hotel employees they speak loud no respect and not eager to make your stay happy no air condition available but not effective very hot inside rooms no refrigerators you can only use it to buy the high price cola one type of water tax they will ask you to pay high tax when you are leaving not clear in there offer ,0
 staircases with no carpet and dust everywhere cleaner in my room before i checked out had thrown away all i d left in the bathroom confusing location and breakfast uncomfortable bed very expensive for a poor experience,0
 pool spacious clean rooms and right next to o2,1
 very small rooms,0
 very clear and modern and the location is great next to waterloo and south bank the breakfast is great as well ,1
 dirty rooms bad bathrooms carpet coming up loud train the whole time,0
 a haven of peace in hectic london a great hotel which i have visited twice now and which i have promoted to my standard london hotel ,1
 fantastic location by the arc de triumph and opposite the top of the champs elysees with a metro station and airport transfer bus stop right outside the front of the hotel incredible views from the balcony very helpful staff ,1
 if compare to price disappointed ,0
 great location easy transportation to everything walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores room was very quiet and comfortable,1
 breakfast very good,1
 beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested,1
 we were upgraded as it was my husbands birthday it was a nice welcome,1
 at check in they demand a gbp50 deposit which they reserve on your credit debet card why they do that is a mystery to me i suppose it is for minibar use and people not paying for it my room did not even have a minibar what they don t tell you is that you won t have the money released at check out after later calling the hotel it turns out this takes at least 5 days and they blame the bank for that this is absolutely ridiculous another thing is that the bathtub was full of hairs which is disgusting and towels have black spots and haris on them they were also old worn out luckily there were enough towels so i could use the best one there is no coffee tea station at the breakfast buffet instead somebody walks around with a coffee pot the coffee clearly had been standing al long time and tasted horrible for the price i had to pay for one night it is a robbery i will never ever come back and would never recommend this to anybody i know ,0
 it s very difficult as i don t know where to start 1 all the staff are foreign which is not bad as itself but the problem was they can t speak english at all you expect that the people who work at reception can speak a good english so you can at least check in 2 found staffs are rude from the reception to the kitchen for instance the trainee receptionist was a young guy with glasses can t remember his name but when i asked him to get me his manager he told me that in his wording i m the boss when my manger is not here he was saying this while he was wearing a trainee name badge 3 very old hotel with scary lift 4 the beds are very small and uncomfortable,0
 the hotel is old and the location is baad rooms are quite small and old and very poor ,0
 located ideal for metro in a safe area and perfect for sight seeing easy to reach from off the euro star from london has excellent selection of restaurants on door step in the lively bercy area facilities and standards are excellent at the hotel attentive service and prompt check in and out ,1
 the cleanliness ,0
 very small rooms booked deluxe double room and what we got was a matchbox no larger than 2x2 with our bed going from wall to wall so you had to climb from the bottom no window which i understand it is normal at this hotel but the room was not suitable for 2 persons and no vent in the bathroom i would not usually accept this but luckily we were knackered after 3 weeks of traveling and stayed what a mistake very thin walls and i assume next doors bed was very close ours as until 3am our neighbours were having fun but privacy was 0 for them and probably the whole floor could hear unfortunately i would not recommend ,0
 staff excellent very helpful relaxed atmosphere,1
 the room was dirty and in dire need of updaating the bed and linens were so uncomfortable we barely got any sleep this was our last night in paris and we were unable to find a room anywhere else that was 3 stars due to fashion week now i know why this one was available ,0
 the staff are so nice and specially the lady who was serving us the breakfast for the 3days she s the best one location is super ,1
 convenient location equidistant from westminster bridge and royal festival hall,1
 no windows and quality for the price,0
 the staff was great ,1
 small room basement floor so very stuffy and difficult to ventilate ,0
 the staff was unhelpful we were there for 2 nights only and the room was not cleaned next day they said they forgot out of three days spend in paris how can someone forget to clean the room in the hotel which claims to be a 4 star the room smelt of old cigarette smoke and the the carpet was really dirty we were not provided with slippers or bathrobes ,0
 the club facilities were extremely poor food provided in club lounge was very basic and limited in veriety only one type of beer which was not even cold the coffee machine was closed down after 9 30 pm on departure my credit card was overcharged from the agreed amount in my booking com confirmation ,0
 good location helpful staff,1
 check in was extremely slow facilities in the room tired and needed upgrading breakfast really poor good food but cold really not good enough staff didn t really seem to know what they where meant to do ,0
 state of the rooms and hotel were appalling health and safety hazzards everywhere rude staff which were very unhelpful very expensive for the state of the place,0
 staff friendly lovely clean room good facilities,1
 excellent base for short visits to london v good breakfast charming garden well maintained and equipped if small rooms tube station 5 mins walk,1
 no tissues no slippers dryclean was so expensive,0
 free upgrade from an inside twin to the penthouse suite,1
 great location,1
 very well kept hotel with a lovely garden staff particularly friendly and professional a very nice room,1
 location customer service breakfast was served in very best room what ever i asked they were more then happy to help ,1
 bed was so comfortable the shower amazing all the extra bits coffee machine etc didn t manage to visit the spa as we had a show to get too staff so friendly will definitely be booking again ,1
 driven out of our ground floor room between 9am and 5pm on two days by intolerable hotel construction noise which only stopped at the weekend staff unhelpful and off hand during check in we had back to back reservations and when we complained about noise just agreeing it was awful finally we insisted on leaving or being moved to an upper floor which was accomplished another half day later new room was small with only a shower and lacked amenities but was thankfully quiet ironically we went to london for a few days to get away from our own home reconstruction ,0
 the free phone the free wine the excellent room service meal the extremely likeable staff,1
 reception welcome very very unfriendly and almost rude you need to provide the credit card which you used when you made a reservation as it was a present and booked by somebody else we had to pay again while the original payment was cancelled staff was very confrontational and asked to send a form to the person who made the booking to provide all the personal information and copy of the passport etc just unreal also the room was so noisy and the wind rattling through the windows felt we slept outside although we had a sign at the door do no disturb cleaners opened the door at 7 30am on sunday good we had the chain on as otherwise she he would have just walked in horrible never experienced it before will never stay in this hotel in the future ,0
 we have reserved a deluxe double room however the room had only a bed with a size of 190 cm x 120 cm which rates as single according to international standards we couldn t even fit two pillows on it next to each other and the room was so tiny that there wasn t enough space between the bed and any of the walls to fit our normal sized luggage the staff advised us to leave our luggage at the reception however there was not even a cupboard in the room where we could put our clothes only a small rack for the coats there was just enough space between the bathroom and the bed to open its door but once it was open the only way to enter it was through the bed this room was much smaller than you expect at any hostel at a price of an expensive 4 star hotel there were also hairs on the bed and in the shower and also one of the towels had brown spots after some extremely frustrating and heated debates with the very unprofessional and arrogant staff the manager the manager of the manager and the manager of the manager of the manager we got 25 discount for that night breakfasts but for the quality it was still way overpriced from the next day we could move to another room which was much bigger than the first one but the quality was still not high overall our stay was a nightmare so i would not recommend this hotel to anybody ,0
 beds rock hard staff unfriendly on arrival no staff to ask directions hotel rooms tired ,0
 location for purposes of visit ,1
 i believe the problem started with booking com who did not inform the hotel of our updated booking which caused chaos on arrival with 15 people to organise and the rooms all mixed up my daughters room was not clean my sisters room had sweet papers under the sheets and a shoe horn when she opened the bed she also had no cold water and her shower was broken we ordered afternoon tea as a special treat in advance as it was my two daugters 30th and 40th birthdays advising that one person was gluten and wheat intolerant an hour and half later we were still waiting for this they said due to the fact they had to go out and buy special stuff even though it was pre ordered we cancelled in the end as the whole experience was ruined they also tried to say one stand of food with six finger sandwiches on it and cakes was for 6 people the same evening my sister asked if the chips were ok for her to eat they told you they did not know whether they contained gluten or wheat hopeless also we paid in full on arrival yet the hotel used the bank details i gave booking com and took 100 out of my account i am struggling to get this back as i write this this hotel for a hilton hotel leaves a lot to be desired and improved ,0
 everything,0
 lovely bed great staff went the extra mile lovely bar with fantastic views very comfortable overall room service excellent room facilities as expected for this caliber of hotel ,1
 everything,1
 had to sleep on a sofa bed after they messed up my booking should have slept 4 in room facilities were only for 2 room service was also poor ,0
 hotel needs more than location to be good hire better staff worst hotel ever i had booked penthouse suite for 1 night i would never ever use park plaza brand anywhere in the world park plaza county hall should be a case study on how to lose customers check in early check in request was met with callous attitude the front desk seemed to enjoy the ordeal seeing us in distress of red eye from washington with an ill family member all the front desk members were doings were enjoying my frustration asked me to come back at 2pm as the policy stated i walked in exactly at 2pm guess what room wasn t ready excuses and stories followed i didn t expect early check as a right but 2 problems 1 attitude of staff 2 weren t ready with room even as per written policy they played usual practice of offering me free breakfast which i refused and did not use room poor and dated furnishing cheap furniture wardrobe doors did not close air condition thermostat buttons don t work for setting the desired temperature you have to call the desk and tell them and they set it from maintenance room somewhere room was freezing again at night causing my family members sickness grow bad and no one could sleep silver lining checkout was smooth with nice staff manager intervened during check in and tried to damage control sounded more constrictive and sensitive hotel needs to hire such people everywhere ,0
 change the management soon,0
 hotel overall was fine unfortunately our room was awful g5 it was tiny nothing like any of photographs noisy due to been on street level so constant traffic noise dark and dingy with no space the bed was pushed up against window with a table next to it which you had to climb over to get into bed the tv was on the wall at the left side of the bed so impossible to watch clearly a failed attempt at adding another room ,0
 i loved the interior decoration and history of the building ,1
 good location and easy transport links,1
 location and view was amazing,1
 great little hotel ,1
 everything else i booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week the stay was for myself and my parents i havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before i get married firstly booking com has advertised the room i was booking with a picture of the room with a view to london eye or big ben did we get that view not at all and we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door my mom is disabled so i went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect so they changed our room to a junior suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station i have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to big ben or london eye which they said is not their fault and theres the shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the shard is in the city this is the city view you can say that pretty much about anything i appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until i realised that the spa bookings i have made for myself and my mother have not been made complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay there were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof i have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes the next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again i have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life ,0
 when we were there it was very hot and air condition was not working staff did not help at all and was just saying sorry could not sleep whole night and when requested for fan was given next day manager promised a c will be repaired but it did not happen and was like i am sorry so i would not recommend this place in summer if you are looking for pleasant sleep the room on my side was very noisy ,0
 the location of the hotel was excellent for access to all locations russell square tube station next door ,1
 exceptionally helpful staff excellent room and facilities and a central location ,1
 breakfast was less choices and keep repeat everyday compare on what i expect on hilton london to hilton asia small is very old and small not on my expectation no shower cap cotton buds inside slipper and etc cleaner is noisy when cleaning the other room ,0
 hotel was run down needs urgent re furbushment room service was awful came back to a half cleaned room,0
 what didn t we like about the hotel it was beautiful we loved everything at the apex we couldn t ask for any more the staff were so lovely friendly the food and the cocktails were amazing made with the best ingredients the room was beautiful and amazing so modern and comfy just never wanted to leave the room the nights sleep was one of the best we ve had in ages and the elemis free toiletries was a lovely touch elemis is a amazing brand to use ,1
 this hotel is not a 4 hotel the bedroom and the bathroom need a massive remodeling the bathroom was really mouldy and the carpet saw better days it was really hot in the room and no air conditioning we just had a little fan that saw better days also be aware that there is no lift and the stairs are steep so if you are older or with kids it could be tricky ,0
 overall for the hilton group is a renowned hotelier however i found that the staff were pretty glum i got woken up by the room cleaner at 8 15am we were booked for checking out at 12 00am generally very disappointed as i was celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and wanted some special treatment felt let down had requested via a phone call before our arrival to the staff of the fact that a complimentary surprise for my wife would have been a good gesture but i had to remind the staff for that as well ,0
 being charged twice for extras without my knowledge cleanliness could be better being told the limo was mine to use and it in fact wasn t but being charged anyway ,0
 the room not clean noisy all the time,0
 location was right next to some adult toys shop,0
 the whole hotel looked very nice and it was in a very good location close to the underground the room was also very nice and clean good facilities with internet access,1
 location to the o2 very comfortable bed,1
 not really that nice triple room had a sofa bed which was very small and disappointing as we expected 3 single beds tv did not work and they could not fix it very poor lighting in the room stayed in much nicer for less cost ,0
 everything right down to the breakfast ,1
 i paid 162 per night for a nominally superior double room it was so small that it was barely possible to walk round both sides of what was no bigger than a double bed the layout was appalling inadequate space to hang even one person s clothes virtually no drawers whatsoever the bathroom did not have a single shelf on which to place toiletries nowhere was there even one glass for water i have never ever been so ripped off my inquiry whether this really was a superior double was to be referred to the manager no one ever got back to me by all means pass this on to the hotel management i am 76 and have never anywhere in a lifetime of travelling encountered such a ripoff who on earth gave this place 4 stars ,0
 the room was very small and not suitable for more than one person the bed was smaller than an average double and the air con didn t work although we had a window if you opened it the curtain would move meaning you re flashing the double decker bus outside that s aside from the building works across the road and general road noise it s like everything in the room had shrunk the cleaner would speak loudly on her mobile while cleaning the hall and other rooms without care for other guests the hall had no lighting we had to use our phones for light reception was a desk in the coffee shop downstairs this was where we also found out our breakfast was served breakfast was interesting warm sliced cheese warm yoghurts and fruit curly bread and if you want a pastry you better get there early overall this is one of the worst hotels i have stayed in and wouldn t recommend to anyone ,0
 a nightmare,0
 fab location lovely staff nice room great breakfast ,1
 extremely good breakfast and very friendly helpful staff,1
 when you first walk into the lobby it looks nice and cozy but once you get into the room that s were you get very disappointed the rooms are way over due for renovation the walls have nasty staines and scratches the comfortater looked like it hasn t been washed in ages blanket had red stains on it gross i should have taken pictures to post it here but you ll see for yourself if you happen to stay there shower was all rusty and splashed water all over the place tv remote was broken and tv itself had very poor signal almost impossible to watch but the most disturbing part was the mini bar it had the bottle of sparkling water with broken seal on it refilled with tap water they claim to be the 4 star hotel it s a lie i would barely give them 2 ,0
 location for our purpouses friendly staff,1
 good location for sightseeing ,1
 novotels have that little extra quality facilities great value for money ,1
 pull out bed was uncomfortable could feel the springs on the mattress against my bones no bath towels in room when i called reception they bought one towel when there were three of us in the room security lock box was not fixed for the entire 4 day stay had to carry my valuable around with me at all times broken toilet water keep flushing had to push hard to stop it reception failed to follow though on the morning call caused me to be late for an event very disappointed with this hotel ,0
 service from every single individual staff member we came across was absolutely outstanding we felt right at home from the moment we parked up in the car park our bags were taken straight away and checking in couldn t have went any smoother would definitely recommend ,1
 really really hot inside bad condition we called the staff twice and finally the came after 30mins but it still got the whole night bad bad ,0
 hotel was lovely from the outside and reception friendly staff great location,1
 new clean and comfy spectacular views ,1
 the location with the walk way through to the o2 the views and the overall comfort of the room all excellent the breakfast was very good too we would recommend this hotel loved it and can t wait to go back ,1
 very damp smell in room that made out clothes smell room a bit shabby and small ,0
 the room was extremely basic and very small its was next to the kitchen so got the impression i was tucked away in the basement i wouldn t stay there again ,0
 the room are too small and really bad smell on the corridor floor think it is time to make a change in this hotel in the capital of paris we can find better breakfast outside dont need to have any breakfast in the hotel but the biggest problem is realy bad bad smell on the corridor ,0
 the location staff and facilities are superb would highly recommend staying here if you are attending an event at the nearby o2 ,1
 this was one my worst experience ever to the point i have to leave a review about this bad service impolite staff not comfortable basically stay away ,0
 price food couldnt find correct light switch toiletries provided minimal despite having an exp room,0
 the staff made our stay as good as it was all were very welcoming and politie but diana at the front desk was particularly fantastic ringing our room to check everything was to our liking and leaving a personal note in our room wishing us a great evening at the concert we were going to the breakfast we had in the morning was also superb and we look forward to our next visit ,1
 no obvious entrance if hotel entrance from inside mall the hotel is very old and not well maintained many bathroom equipment not functioning ,0
 convenience to south bank attractions and old vic theatre,1
 the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming the bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business i didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there the location to the tube was excellent,1

 comfy bed friendly staff good breakfast and good location for sight seeing,1
 the bed was so soft like rishaaa,1
 booking in staff told us it was an excellent room window view of a dirty courtyard looking into other hotel rooms and the room right opposite 3 lifts is not an excellent room a slow bar tender taking forever to serve 1 small drink would rather chat to his work colleagues than focus on his job description thanks for the fire alarm going in the early hours of monday morning ,0

 the room was in an unacceptable state for this class of hotel see pictures e g water damage on the ceiling paint coming off the wall door joints of the tiles in the bathroom in awful condition partly mouldy and or dirty broken turning knob of the shower risk of injury uninsulated power cable in the bathroom drain of the wash basin was blocked windows not properly insulated thus loud noise coming in draughty quite slow reaction of the personnel when complaining about the above mentioned issues in addition electricity problems response time of the staff was 20 minutes very pleasant in a dark night highly unfriendly personnel at the reception at both days even bold,0

 the room was dirty and smells so bad the shower room didn t have any curtain the hair driver was broken but the price wasn t cheap if the photos of the booking com had told us the true situation we wouldn t have reserved i never advice you to reserve this hotel absolutely not ,0
 i enjoyed my time in the hotel everything were perfect and great breakfast was very well the staff very kindly especially tina and diana i will stay more and more in that hotel again ,1
 unfortunately there is nothing grand or royal about this hotel i had room 404 the floor creaked the ceiling creaked as people in the room above me moved around the room was not clean old grubby fingermarks on both sides of the bathroom door weeks of dirt on the washbasin lamps corners of the bathroom hadn t been cleaned housekeeping woke me up and walked in at 08 00am then back again at 09 00am even though checkout is specified as 12 00 noon i had an upgraded room to superior and it was tiny 25cms between the bed and the wall window god knows how small a standard deluxe room is ,0
 i cancelled my hotel to rebook for better price however was charged the difference anyway ,0
 no hot water on several occasions general decor very poor lift no working on one day room on the fifth floor staff not friendly not helpful pre paid for a suite 780 for 3 nights rip off better in a traveloge,0
 i was standing near bond street station by the traffic lights contemplating whether to travel back home to luton or stay a night as i only had to travel back the next day for training the booking was easy and within half hour of me booking i was in my room it was the best process ever for me that day i was very comfortable the staff were great because they interacted with me and noticed that i had stayed there before with that i was given an upgrade as you could imagine in my head bonus my day is getting better it s a great location for leisure of business ,1
 stayed in a room with ac that didn t work when complaint to the staff they said they will get it fixed that following day the ac still didn t work when complained again they said that they will take care of it and once again they didn t spent two nights sweating in a room with a very uncomfortable bed on the third day i came to the staff when i was sweating and said to them that i can t take it i left a hotel and when i came back they gave me a new room with a terrible bed although this time the ac did work after terrible few nights i left the hotel although i paid for an extra night it was just horrible expirience that left me so disturbed and ruined my trip to london ,0
 i got horribly bitten by bed bugs bed mattress was horrible,0
 our room was small as was the bathroombut it was clean and comfortable the location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to restaurants and shopping kensington gardens is right on the doorstep perfect for an early morning run it s an easy walk to many attractions including the portobello markets the hotel is charming with comfortable lounge areas ,1
 bed comfy and sheets changed daily ,1
 the pictures online for this hotel seem deceptive the outside looks nice but the rooms were very small we were given a tiny room 406 on the last floor at our arrival there were two free bottles of water but one was already half used when we took a shower in the evening one towel had makeup stains and dirt it looked like it already had been used the carpets are stained the shower is located inside a bathtub with no curtain to keep the water in the ceiling is slanted in such a way that you were hardly able to use it without touching the wall located very close to an old window with rotting wood the window and floor got soaked every time we used it we forgot an expensive set of ear phones in our room in one of the drawers we contacted the hotel they indicated that the maintenance staff found nothing oh well the service at the bar breakfast room is very unprofessional and would benefit from customer service training ,0
 excellent location 2 minutes to earl s court underground clean room and new facilities friendly staff a good variety of breakfast to choose from ,1
 the location was great,1
 my room on the 6th floor was adjacent to an air conditioning heating unit that emitted a loud irritating humming noise all night when i opened the window hoping to let some of the sound escape there was another even larger unit in the courtyard making an even louder noise i expect some city noise traffic people but this was dreadful i left the next day because this was unacceptable and when you consider high cost of the room you do expect to be able to sleep ,0
 it s not clean not helpful as coustmer services last year was very good this zero service and cleaning,0
 the phone provided is excellent for international travelers ,1
 renovations taking place which were not communicated foul smell outside our room things left from previous guest,0
 very well located in between st michel and luxembourg staff was nice and smiling,1
 nice and quiet and yet close to the trains and heyd park very clean ,1

 nice and quite room was spacious with iron and ironing board bose bluetooth speaker very comfortable bed a proper bed,1
 room very very small,0
 nothing about it was as portrayed on their website the entry and check in was extremely sub standard the room was only accessible by numerous stairs and extremely small with the toilet and shower in the bed room in full view no walls the view out of the room was to a very close brick wall the entire hotel was very dark we were told by the staff that it was an hour from the eiffel tower yet it comes up under the heading of hotels in close proximity to the eiffel tower we were charged an extra 30euros to be put in an only very slightly larger room that was accessible by lift with the toilet in its own little room again with an awful brick wall view when i requested to take photos of the original room that we were given they refused to let me have access the only attractive thing about both rooms were the bed linens the staff were very rude when we voiced our disappointment,0
 availability of fitness centre,1
 the room was extra large with 2 bathrooms and the staff were very helpful,1
 they aren t give us the room i booked and they are booking anther hotel bad service and not like the room i shoes it and the city hotel orady token mony from me before 4 day s thats not good for customers,0
 great location and great room with views of the shard,1

 it s a fantastic very modern hotel with friendly and helpful staff our room was spacious with a comfortable bed breakfast was excellent and the spa swimming pool superb ,1
 location is not friendly or welcoming for a tourist there are a few conditions attached to this hotel so be warned,0
 vintage ambience of hotel,1
 we stayed in an executive suite and it was very nice water pressure was great in the shower a big plus in my book and the sofa bed was very comfortable also the property was very clean and every staff member we had contact with was friendly and helpful great stay overall i would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the westminster area and or plans to do much day tripping as waterloo station will connect you with just about anywhere you want to go ,1
 my room was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 room was just shabby ,0
 the staff were all very friendly and attentive the food was superb my 9 year old great nephew could barely believe the breakfast enough food to feed an army served by a waitress who deserves special commendation very professional cheerful and obliging the porters were also all very helpful the lobby bar is well worth a visit the hotel is within easy reach of many of the west end theatres and other attractions ,1
 good location and average price breakfast is nice ,1
 staff and location the lobby looks great the hotel has elevator and air conditioning ,1
 when we arrived the entire hotel was clad in scaffolding at the front desk i asked if our room was free of scaffolding and was told that the only rooms open were in the basement there was no mention of this on viking com or the hotel website which is pretty outrageous the room was built under the pavement in front of the hotel and had a small frosted glass window looking out except you couldn t look out onto some kind of store room hard to tell almost no natural light in the room people talked just outside the window evening in the middle of the night possibly staff having a cigarette break the room itself was very small for the 228 charged for the one night the hot water took ages to heat up the cold water tap ran warm for ages the air conditioning unit rattled no breakfast included in the 228 the front desk apologised for the building work when i first arrived and asked about having a room without scaffolding i pointed out there was no note about the construction work when i looked and booked online he said customers who rang were informed but most people book online clearly i would not have booked this hotel in this state if i had known and i regard the lack of warning as extremely bad trading practice ,0
 the building is so beautiful ans super convenient location,1
 quite and clean,1
 the historical design of the hotel it was clean the service staff was excellent ,1
 staff were very helpful friendly,1
 comfiest bed ,1
 very large room hidden courtyard view with backdrop of the city is beautiful short walk to public transport blackfriars tube station and temple station ,1
 toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped ,0
 size of the room staff service and gym on site like deco in general ,1
 everything the hotel is very noisy and the rooms are very old and ugly,0
 the staff were amazing friendly spoke english all recommended restaurants excursions were amazing the staff also gave excellent advice on staying safe in paris the free toiletries were amazing and showers are very powerful ,1
 combination of parisian charm and spotless facilit for the business traveller ,1
 staff extremely poor english understaffed parking there are only 2 two parking slots that s 1 1 2 parking places for the whole 82 bed hotel that there are away from the hotel they charge 35 day but you park on your own risk to summarize this hotel does not have a hotel parking room tiny we booked the executive king because we had read that the standard ones were small it is barely 12 square meters bed mattress ultra soft felt like a water matrress not pleasant for your back ,0
 hotel location and the view,1
 terrible staff slow not helpful the worst room i stayed in london depressing experience,0
 rude personnel personnel gave us a wrong room did not want to admit their fault trying to seem like we were wrong finally when another colleague came we did get the correct room no apologies were made when we mentioned that the other colleague was rude we were told we were liars to get to the elevator you first have to use stairs very inconvenient to be climbing stairs with your suitcases also no hotelstaff offered to help with luggage we had to do it all by outself ,0
 bathroom smelt really bad and even though a member of staff provided us with some air freshener it didn t permanently cover it breakfast was disappointing with no hot food and only instant coffee out of machine ,0
 the room was lovely with a view looking on to the lyceum theatre lobby bar made fabulous cocktails lavender cloud in particular staff were lovely love this hotel and cant wait to go back again,1
 handy location next to the underground clean rooms with comfy beds breakfast was pretty good as well for london it was fairly good value for money ,1
 this is never a 4 star hotel the double bed completely filled the room space impossible to walk round 96 night and 15 for breakfast is a rip off they use private hire taxi s at inflated prices when they could easily use black cabs which are constantly driving past their front door ,0
 smiling staff couldn t do more to help quirky atmosphere love the victorian entrance ,1
 no ac in room and it was stuffy and very hot their solution was a mobile ac which was ineffective and very noisy terrible value for money used to be much better,0
 bed was amazingly comfy and staff were great,1
 sheets on the bed dirty toilet not cleaned had to request a change of room hotel did not change room but asked guest to wait while sheets were changed rooms very small ,0
 the room was too small i am sure that we could find a better hotel to the price that we have paid for that very small room ,0
 very helpful staff nice location and room was clean we were upgraded to a club room at no extra cost ,1
 the location is perfect and the front desk staff friendly and knowledgeable,1
 value for money,1
 if you are not traveling alone in business mind i highly recommend to avoid this hotel we booked their double premium room as expected to have normal size bed and larger room what we get was smaller room than in description and the bed was less than 160cm wide and bumpy in center for two it was very difficult to sleep and caused backaches after two nights we got another room but there was no warm water in the shower only freezing cold in morning when we waited long for it to be fixed we lost our prebooked transportation to the airport and although they promised that manager will contact us later no contact or any compensation never visit there again if travel as couple ,0
 comfy pillows ambient lighting free galaxy hot chocolate provided brilliant view ,1
 it is a travel lodge 4 star 2 star more like ,0
 the rudest staff i have ever encouraged in any hotel in the world i will never walk through the doors of the ritz again they need a lesson in how to treat their guests i suggest they send staff for training at the savoy a truly world class hotel because the ritz is clearly posed itself well above the station of of its guests thinking the staff can treat their guests as second third or lower class citizens they have their whole attitude upside down the savoy saved me and from there and provided me with the most welcoming and wonderful stay ,0
 super noisy no free wifi bathroom smelled not good ,0
 location was perfect for our trip we weren t hassled by anyone but there was always staff around if you needed anything and they were more than happy to help ,1
 staff did not appear very happy guy at breakfast reception was a total misery and could barely bring himself to speak to us hotel is very tired beds totally uncomfortable worst thing of all was having to face a bowl of vomit yes vomit which was left on one floor by the lifts for two days and even after complaint to reception it was left there that s a first in any hotel ranking it as the worst hotel stay ever no price is worth what this place has to offer ,0
 being given the smallest room in the attic as far away from the lift as possible being told that dressing gowns bath robes and decent towels were only for privileged people yes management actually said that when requesting help with your bags to check out being told bell staff aren t available until certain time of the day after making the request the day before and being told that was no problem location was dodgey lots of undesirable people hanging about and concerns about lack of security at hotel will never recommend accor or mercure chain again ,0
 if you always wanted to work on a submarine this would suit you the hallway is very small just enough room for myself and my one piece of luggage the room i got was so small it should have been called a cupboard i could reach the ceiling with my palm and had to stop low to get to the door of the room on a half floor the elevator made all sorts of interesting noises and you never knew what it would do overpriced and aweful i will never use this hotel again and would not recommend it ,0
 great breakfast excellent bed,1
 both the food and the location were wonderful the staff was very helpful and quick to comply all of our requests we ll definitely be coming back again ,1
 hotel was very tired and shabby it was clean for the money i expected better and should have just booked a travel lodge pool was nice but no robes and changing area wasn t ideal next to pool side ,0
 loved the location ideal for the concert we had at the apollo hammersmith good choice at breakfast staff a bit miserable and i don t want to see a manager dressing down a member of staff in the breakfast hall do it out the back please and make them a little more courteous room clean and comfortable with a great view excellent reception staff when we checked in wish i could remember his name ,1
 everything,0
 booked a 4 night for my birthday on check in told we had to go to identical sister hotel other side of the road staff were friendlier there however room was small dark very shabby very dated couldn t walk round bed properly and the tiniest bathroom i have ever see breakfast was so so but foot cold on third morning restaurant staff were friendly and helpful tho unlike the reception staff at the shaftesbury very disappointed ended up checking out on the day of my birthday definitely wouldn t recommend it,0
 the staff is very bad,0
 there was a t v in the bathroom mirror plus a really large one in bedroom excellent location we could see the sorbonne from our bedroom window ,1
 so we got the deluxe king room and it was such a huge disappointment the eiffel view basically means you ll hardly see the eiffel on the right handside behind a huge tree and pillars such a waste of money when we addressed this the guy at the front reception said it s called clever marketing more like customer deception anyway the manager was a very lvoely helpful woman and she said she d give us a smaller room but with a better view but we couldnt be refunded the amount we paid for the dekuxe king room later on our friend wasnt well at night and the staff was extremely unhelpful they wouldnt call the hospital or the ambulance and while our friend clenched her chest and was throwing up they were just on the phone insisting we get a private doctor and just wouldnt call the ambulance it was an extremely traumatizing experience and their customer service needs to be worked on tremendously we had paid for two nights but checked out the very same night and didnt even get a refund ,0
 breakfast service,1
 gorgeous building great links with 2 tube stations on different lines good quality value breakfast selection of places to eat nearby bag hold gave us another full day in london before our train at 7pm 12pm check out love a lay in ,1

 lovely breakfast had a junior suite for great value free paper short walk from paddington station would stay here again,1
 the bed was horrendously noisy every time my partner turned in the night i was woken up did not sleep well would not return again ,0
 cold coffee delivered with room service meal on checkout reception couldn t give me an itemised room service bill so no idea if amount i paid was correct tv had bad interference and was unwatchable but probably due to windy conditions outside need an electric socket on rhs of bed with 2 phones laptops ipad not enough sockets for 2 people ,0
 we stayed in a wing in a dire need of renovation the carpets were old and there was an unpleasant smell in the corridors noisy elevators the room looked as it has not been redecorated for 30 years old refrigerator with some old flaking labels nothing inside apart from a box of juice left probably by previous occupants wooden tub casing coming off and cheap wifi coverage was ok but vpn connection was blocked so good for watching youtube but no use for remote work and serious business i can understand there may be rooms of different standard in a hotel but then the charges should also be adequately discounted i am especially disappointed as i am a member of hilton honours programme ,0
 the breakfast and the room,1

 the facilities are excellent leisure center is very good even it is with fee room staff facilities are very good room is very large,1
 very convenient location for central london impressive grand and historic hotel with very nice lobby and bar area helpful and friendly staff not cheap but reasonable for the quality of hotel in london ,1
 we loved everything the location was perfect the staff was excellent and especially mariana who went over and above to make our stay great ,1
 the staff was unfriendly and abrupt they have taken off 3 payments for the stay in the hotel which i still have not been reimbursed the room was so small and we were two people sharing the photos on their website did not show such small rooms the carpets were dirty and had stains on them the staff didn t inform us that the price per night had actually decreased and was r1300 per night as apposed to r3000 per night ,0

 the staff were rude and incompetent on check in lied which made the whole experience unpleasant no parking on check in at around 3 so had to look elsewhere for parking had to wait in huge que to check in full balance of hotel and a 50 was taken as a holding deposit off my card however i wasn t told about this checked into room was given a twin room however i had booked a large double bed room in december i was then told there was no other rooms however they had disabled rooms with access which were still not what we booked i was told by the staff i had booked a disable room however when i said so why was i given a twin room they had no answer i was told by a staff member to understand that is what i had booked to which i showed him my paperwork which said large double bed then after a long wait i was given the room i had booked and the staff member was hoping for some appraisal for getting me the room which i had already booked then on check out my card was again taken and i was charged again for the room so currently my card is still on hold of 200 not including the room charge which i wasn t even told about i phoned the hotel to ask about the holding charge and why it was being held as i hadn t been told on check in and was told that there was no booking under my name i was then asked what room after telling the lady the room all of a sudden i had stayed at the hotel with no apology whatsoever so all in all if you want a great experience pay less and youll most likely get more of a pleasant service all in all worst hotel i have ever stayed in for service ,0
 i had to wait at reception for check in for 20 minutes and i was annoyed the kind italian gentlemen at the reception added free breakfast for me and kept trying to crack jokes until i had a smile and accepted the apology the free breakfast was very good and i would definitely of paid for it variety of things to have i checked out but my meeting was at 4pm they let me wait at the lovely waiting room downstairs until i was ready to leave the staff definitely cared about their customer being happy thank you i d definitely come again,1
 bed hard pillows very firm german officious staff,0

 really well designed and furnished bedrooms very helpful staff who took every opportunity to assist,1
 rooms were awful drinks too expense staff not very good,0
 staff were helpful and the indian food was good in the evening ,1
 none,0
 the previous reviewers should have been paid by the hotel to review it deceiving reviews poor value for money the hotel is barely 2 stars and the service is truly appalling there are better options nearby ,0
 decor in bedrooms very tired ,0
 nice room clean and tidy ,1
 the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly but still professional and well run refreshing for a city centre hotel ,1
 bed was very comfortable apart from the pillows we found them too soft but that can bee a personal preference room was really spacious with superb views over the thames breakfast was amazing and the hotel itself felt luxurious and spotlessly clean all staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable would stay again good transport links ,1
 lovely corporate style hotel large comfortable room with nice extras ,1
 apparently we booked the cheapest room as we were put in a room without windows at first hotels always seem to try to do that until you complain we ended up getting a better room but i truly dislike a hotel trying this these hotels don t get my patronage anymore so last time at the montcalm ,0
 helpful friendly staff good location,1
 1 wifi service is very poor and you have to log in every time 2 they mixed up our breakfast order twice 3 placed us in the basement despite my request to be in upper foors it was very noisy 4 the room service was very poor they were using the towels to clean the washroom floors and the bed sheets were not changed despite having stains on it 5 this is the first hotel i experience in my life that they don t have a scale to weigh our luggage,0
 everything,0
 great hotel original concept style,1
 very helpful general manager,1
 uncomfortable bed rooms too small no fridge only mini bar,0
 great location very friendly and efficient staff i m coming back ,1
 did not get a good nights rest no water in the room aircon was broken on top of that we were accused of having the tv too loud when it was not on in the first place we were woken up to a very loud phone call in the morning by reception accusing us of having our television too loud that phone call left my heart racing and unstable as i was just woken up from sleep to hear that rubbish not very good for me who already has high blood pressure later on after complaining to the manager it was found out that the complaint was clearly against the wrong room absolutely the worst hotel experience i have had in my entire life i do not recommend this hotel at all for 179 a night ,0
 perfect location helpful staff,1
 impressive reception rooms and breakfast room good choice of breakfast comfortable bed ,1
 nice bed plenty of room good selection for breakfast ,1
 noisy room even though we requested a quiet one no good eateries around the area we booked at the park grand kensington as we had several events and chores to do around the area that could be done either by walking or a couple of tube stops max when we got there only they informed us they were doing some maintenance work and they will locate us to a sister hotel which was in paddington nightmare all our trips took at least 30 45min extra and had to use lots of taxis which is enormously expensive we said we didn t want another area and all what they said was sorry we tried to inform our customers this is not true as i did the booking on march 3 and i think they had enough time to inform us of this if they told us that before hand we could ve either cancelled as we had free cancellation until 1 day prior to arrival or used the heathrow express to reach paddington rather than paying a ridiculously high taxi fare from the airport to kensington then jump on the free taxi they provided to the other hotel as a reward they also provided us with breakfast but it wasn t of any interest this was done extremely unprofessionally and i would advise you to confirm with the hotel before booking there ,0
 bed was to bouncy and there was a moose in the room,0
 great clean hotel and quality staff very convenient location as i had to take a train from st pancras international walking distance ,1
 rooms not available at check in ac not working in one room,0
 really comfortable bed the staff especially the concierge are very friendly and knowledgeable about the local area the gym is excellent ,1
 i did not like that the hotel was short of staff in the evening by short i mean there was no one except one person at the reception and that was it so for everything i wanted i had to go downstairs room was very small for a family of 3 there was no space to move in the room no place for luggage at all no tissues were provided to us in the room there were stains on the carpet the room was cleaned everytime we went out but the cleanliness went down as the day passes by we were in the hotel for 5 days ,0
 hotel very handy for underground bed comfortable a nice gesture it was my husbands 60th birthday and management give him a bottle of red wine ,1
 loved the well kept garden and the cleanliness of the property,1
 the staff were not friendly at all one old guy sitting on the reception with food in his mouth had no customer skills that was the instant bad impression room are totally not like what they look like in the pictures they literally feel and looked dirty rooms are very small not worth the money at all corridors are covered with red carpet and dirt shows on the even a blind person can see it same is with the door locks if u touch then please please please wash your hands after the hotel does not give u comfort or safe feeling on the contrary u feel scared and insecure they dont even have free cancilation they should have it because after entering the hotel and see the bad customer service almost every one with right mind would want to walk out of that place i guess they know this that is the reason they dont have free cancellation services this hotel in perticulerly spoiled my trip and the image of paris forever for me please please please people be carefull this place is not worth it at all there is many other places batter then this 100 times on cheeper prices stay away from this place ,0
 it was very very noisy in the morning between 1 and 7 i can not sleep because of cars alarm and people hubbub ,0
 filthy carpets small toilet in room which had a strong smell off a urinal,0
 comfortable beds,1
 super comfy bed in the club room amazing shower ,1
 no hot water for our stay came on a romantic holiday to a 4 stay hotel really unimpressed i tally offered a croissant as compensation eventually offered 20 off the bill ,0
 outrageously expensive especially breakfast pricing,0
 the quality of the food at breakfast was poor,0
 the location of the hotel is great room and bed were comfortable and clean we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time however we were able to get an early check in with no problems would definitely stay there again ,1
 there were several rooms of disruptive guests school children on my floor each day sometimes multiple times i had to call the front desk to report door slamming running back and forth in the hall loud noise this happened on sat night until 11 45 pm and began sunday morning at 7 30 am the hotel staff person on sunday night said i have asked the children to be quiet but they haven t done it so there is nothing we can do i could not believe this finally i asked her to meet me on my floor in the hallway and we were going to have a conversation with the children and their teacher adult accompanying them and get this resolved so we did just that the teacher was very attentive and he did stop the noise i just wonder why the hotel staff did not take such initiative on friday saturday and sunday so frustrating and disruptive i mentioned that i was certain there was a hotel policy on unnecessary noise and disruption but she didn t respond only saying that they had asked them to be quiet and they hadn t done it so they could do nothing this saturday night staff person said she would have the manager contact me i have received no word from the manager i also told this staff person that i would have to go on social media and state what happened as i wouldn t want this to happen to anyone else and she said go ahead i don t care i think this might be the bottom line she didn t care nor did the hotel ,0
 too old bathroom not clean rusty ,0
 the staff were very friendly attentive and responsive the hotel was perfectly located the house keeping were super in cleaning and responding to my requests,1
 staff were nice gave all the information i needed room was nice a little smaller than i had imagined but it was nice view could of been better but overall it was nice also offered me complimentary late chech out but i ended up not using it because of work hours but it was lovely and relaxing ,1
 very genuinely nice people and staff great atmosphere and a relaxed feel super food too ,1
 rooms are quiet beds are huge bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful location is very good thames within walking distance temple area is beautiful note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud ,1
 first room we where given size of the room for 3 adults not great at all shower didn t work no where to unpack your clothes for 3 adults,0
 room placement and spaces ,1
 the housekeeping and cleanileness is zero the service is below average for a 5 star hotel there are very few options for food from room service and the restauraunt was closed the furniture is really old compared to what i saw on the website not child friendly at all wifi was bad ,0
 the actual building is stunning inside breakfast was very good though plates were cold ,1
 very comfortable loved the location,1
 great location 2mins from central line walk through hyde park which is opposite hotel to knightsbridge ,1
 quite,1
 bad rooms paint falling off bad furnishing as always you come back after all days work and room is not even made up then you call three times and wait 2 hours to get a room clean at a hyatt property where you have paid 300 ruros plus a night forget about asking anything from house keeping etc wont come till you have to leave for work etc concierge is knowledeable though and will make your reservations at very nice places for dinner or drinks all an all cant believe hyatt is putting its name on this property ,0
 the staff were excellent,1
 the staff is producing techinal mistakes which result in personal inconviniences ,0
 nice hotel nice location,1
 the hotel was clean warm and modern the superior rooms well equipped and comfortable,1
 the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement ,0
 it was the quietest room in london that i have ever stayed in,1
 the room was so stuffy and it stunk couldn t open a window because the only window was looking into the restaurant had to keep the shutters closed so no one could see me which left the room always dark i didn t know i was paying so much for a single bed the carpet was filthy i didn t want to walk on it without shoes the internet was useless it shut off every 3 minutes and i had to type in the code again i used the internet for probably 2 hours total and had to type in the code about 20 times i thought hilton was supposed to be a decent hotel i was so suprized to have such an uncomfortable stay 200 canadian should get me a lot more considering it wasn t even in a prime location ,0
 the bed was certainly comfy the room was spacious the staff were attentive and pleasant ,1
 the room was perfect good facilities just right amount of space for a family of 4 lovely and clean and comfy beds too ,1
 very comfortable night s sleep pleasant room friendly staff ,1
 staff assistance,1
 the staff were all very pleasant courteous and helpful and made our stay extremely comfortable special mention to mr daniel north the duty manager for arranging our room with a spectacular view of the new year fireworks from the eye of london a memorable stay indeed in welcoming 2016 ,1
 expensive and poor breakfast poor cleaning poor facilities small and short bed the bathroom is just dirty and very poor,0
 very good location and relatively quiet ,1
 nice atmosphere good food and everything was convenient ,1
 check in staff member was extremely helpful and friendly helped to sort out my mistake of booking that day arriving by train a few hours later to find i had booked for a week later helped with sorting out a room with a view of london eye big ben as it wasnt available on booking com website ,1
 1 housekeeping poorly done never clear away used cups in room never provide new bottles of water 2 towels have bad smell 3 lobby has a curry smell,0
 the room was of excellent quality and the bed was so comfortable i could stay there again for this reason alone wifi being free and of good quality was important for someone like myself roaming with my mobile network staff were extremely friendly and professional i would recommend this hotel to everyone possible ,1
 lovely hotel close to tube and train stations beautiful room and bathroom staff helpful and polite breakfast wonderful,1
 bad service,0
 the view and the service ,1
 great location,1
 great hotel if going to the o2 like us for a concert concert to room in under five minutes very helpful staff good rooms and a great sky bar to visit in the evening ,1
 would have liked double beds,1
 we had to request for the bed sheet to be changed and the breakfast was horrible my wife asked for a boil egg and she is still waiting,0
 the fact that i could not have my booking cancelled and my payment refunded due to serous illness i tried to cancel this booking 9 weeks prior to the date disgusted ,0
 nice room good view,1
 small size of rooms corridors bar wasn t great,0
 room and bed comfortable nice modern aesthetic,1
 we stay often in this hotel because we enjoy the area slightly away from the centre but having easy access to the metro and buses the hotel is next to a small parc plus there are many good restaurants nearby,1
 everything room decor comfort,1
 it is the tiniest hotel room i have ever been in it was cramped and at 171 per night it was vastly over priced definitely not good value for money ,0
 staff were so helpful to make the night before and morning of my wedding lovely and stress free from providing a special room with a view to assisting with deliveries of flowers etc everything was great the suite with london eye view was wonderful thanks to all staff particularly concierge ,1
 great staff and location,1
 all very good staff were very helpful ,1
 some of the staff are really rude over rude,0
 many pros very pleased here modern clean large room and bath excellent stay helpful staff usually stay west of here but this location turned out to be perfect for this trip ,1
 small stuffy rooms tiny bathrooms questionable cleanliness and two over utilised elevators check in process was also unbelievably slow at least ten minutes 130 for a single occupancy room with extra 20 required for breakfast what a rip off ,0
 hotel is very well kept and clean looks very nice,1
 fantastic staff breakfast and food was top class best room i have had for a long time ,1
 mysigt hotell med bra l ge n ra hyde park ligger n ra bayswater tunnelbanestation flera resturanger i n rheten hotellet har v ldigt god frukost trevlig personal blev bra kompenserade n r vi var tvungen att byta hotell en natt pga problem med vattnet ,1
 fantastic staff friendly genuine and professional huge comfy bed soft pillows great view delicious food tassimo coffee machine was a great touch we loved the bar on the top floor the london skyline panoramic views were the best i have seen the 02 is literally next door so this is the best hotel to link with a concert,1
 deluxrum singelrum utan kylsk p etc never again,0
 the bar food the room upgrade was a wonderful bonus this was our second visit and we will be making a third next year,1
 the staff was very friendly and the free fruit and water in the lobby was a nice touch ,1
 staff well managers and the fact i haven t received my holding fee back yet after a month of my stay,0
 the bed was incredibly comfortable we stayed in a superior double room and when i woke up i forgot my partner was in the bed next to me as it was so big amazing ,1
 5th time staying there in last 2 years,1
 size and facilities in the room,1
 tiny room no space to even open up a suitcase fittings were all falling apart and the toilet door was broken and could not be locked not clean bedsheets had spots breakfast was too expensive cheaper to buy sandwiches and drinks from the supermarket next door a lot of traffic noise air con was not working throughout our stay despite us telling them about it three times they only offered to hv someone check after 3 nights ,0
 the staff were rude and the concierge wouldn t give us any information about how to get around london the toilet was broken on arrival and it took three phone calls before anything was done and eventually somebody came up at 11 30pm so we had to wait up until they left before we could sleep and we had driven for 8 hours on the second day we got back at 3 30pm to get ready for going to the lion king that night however we got back to the room and housekeeping had not been in i called down to say we were in a rush and wanted showers with no clean towels it took them half an hour to get us towels meaning we didn t have time for a shower before we went out for the night the next day when we returned there was a handyman in the bathroom retiling the bathroom he left after using all the toilet roll for god knows what and the bathroom was a mess from the materials he was using to re tile there was only 1 lift working for the whole hotel for the duration of our stay which meant we had to wait for roughly 5 10 mins every time when house keeping did come i asked the staff member for towels and to not bother cleaning the room she said she didn t speak english and came into the room and started cleaning around us the room we were allocated too had boilers air vents outside that were very noisy all night so gave us a disturbed sleep when going for breakfast we put a do not disturb sign on the door as we had money ipads phones lying around and when we came back from breakfast someone was in our room overall the stay was absolutely horrific and as a hilton honours member i am so disappointed that i will probably never stay in a hilton again ,0
 location is perfect ,1
 customer service leaves a lot to be desired booked for an employee and they refused to accept 3rd party payment booking com did little to help the staff were clueless and quite rude considering i wanted to pay i wasted 3 hours just trying to pay really not worth the hassle ,0
 from the moment we walked through the door we were made to feel welcome a huge mention to the doorman concierge whose friendliness was heart warming and to sara who checked us in staff and customer care are what makes a hotel ,1
 good room cleaning and lavish towels good wifi and pleasant ataff comfortable bed ,1
 we were transferred to their sister hotel the shaftsbury due to some problem with water supply to some of the rooms so this review is actually for that hotel we were given a very small room which had everything you needed and was clean and comfortable but it is just as well that we are smallish people and reasonably fit as the bed was right against the wall and one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out we were given free breakfast every day in compensation of the move which was greatly appreciated and the staff were all lovely the hotel is very close to both bayswater and queensway tube stations and to hyde park ,1
 room wasn t available staff didn t understand english room temp was freezing shower was small over all horrible when i told them they didn t care,0
 size of rooms quality of rooms woman night receptionist,0
 room was very cosy and good standard ,1
 i stayed in room on the 9th floor and the view was absolutely superb our bed was very comfortable there was a funny smell of smoke when we first arrived in our room however this was not a massive issue as we really appreciated the bathroom speaker view from our window and comfy bed ,1
 breakfast was excellent,1
 unfortunately i ve had a weird experience of a cleaning lady entering our room at 8 o clock in the morning i told the receptionists about the incident but she told me i was not the first and definately not the last one to experience that in this hotel i was shocked as i travel a lot around the world and things like this do not take place or if they do the hotel management at least tries to apologize and do something about it my morning was disturbed by this situation and therefore i am not satisfied with my stay in this hotel,0
 no comments,0
 lovely character building,1
 the hotel is located 2 minutes away from 2 underground stations so it s very convenient it s perfect for a stroll in hyde park as well as you just need to cross the road the hotel hall is very beautiful the building is a period building and the hall and staircase seem to belong in an old period movie we had a club room and it was quite small it had a nice alcove where the wardrobe and desk were but the bed area was quite narrow the bed was small but very comfortable ,1
 there was a huge disgusting cockroach in my room so horrible that i am now terrified of hotels in general when i complained the staff just moved me to another worse room and refused to make any other amends for this disgusting experience they told me they had one very small mouse recently but never cockroaches well that s reassuring isn t it ,0
 i like the location the design and the friendly staff,1
 excellent location super helpful staff,1
 room was very small absolutely no ventilation no air condition despite it says so on booking com not possible to sleep at all in a room w o oxygen extemely dirty window facing a backyard answer from the staff you are in the middle of paris very arrogant do not book this place ,0
 staff went the extra mile to make the stay enjoyable ,1
 the rooms were excellent the beds were super comfy overall this is a really lovely hotel one i am definitely staying in again ,1
 sold me breakfast only to find out finishes at 10am poor service the min i got there not feel like a holiday inn felt like holiday from disaster,0
 we first had a small noisy room after we complained we received a better room but with very dirty carpet the second night we woke up at 4am because of noise heating system in the room and in the corridor ,0
 perfect location and friendly staff ,1
 everything,1
 i booked 4 nights arrived around midnight first night and had no room had to go to another hotel of the millennium chain second night had a room and was upgraded to a superior room room very noisy due to location in the hall close to lifts and bathtub did not operate well due to poor plumbing shower with water up to my ankles asked for repair twice and i they did not repair and ii did not say anything next morning same problem claimed at reception and was moved to another room new upgrade but the plumbing issue simply remained the same appears to be a general problem wi fi is free but does not work properly it is ridiculous ,0
 hotel bar very nice place to have a pre drink very friendly and helpful staff,1
 location clinliness comfort,1
 not much to like unfortunately dirty and claustrophobic room for 2 people with suitcases and carry on there was no room for our luggage hairs found in bed powerpoint hanging from wall filthy carpets tiny double beds loud rooms service of the rooms were generally poor on the first day there was 1 4 toilet roll and was not replenished during our 3 night stay,0
 super comfy bed and nice room with good facilities the staff were extremely helpful and friendly nothing was a problem location is steps away from rue du rivoli forum des halles and so many other sights are in walking distance metro is a stones throw so central ,1
 i made online cancellation of breakfast order in september 2016 but no confirmation nor response got in october when i checked in the hotel and re instruct to cancel the coming breakfast order the staff advised that any cancellation or change might be through booking com so i immediately sent the request to booking com via email but still no response when i checked out i re confirm with the hotel that i could get refund for the breakfast charge when i returned to hong kong and contract with booking com she replied that no confirmation got from hotel the services is very poor i won t choose this hotel again,0
 breakfast was lovely good choice and quality great service friendly and polite ,1
 good hotel in excellent location,1
 rooms look new and are modern with a lovely bathroom with rain shower and a comfy bed with huge tv ,1
 the room was tiny noisy and the corridor stink of cigeratte smoke bathroom had pee marks on floor with bath tub full of hair the shower head was broken which was replaced when complained unhygenic place to stay ,0
 enjoyed room service twice very quick and delicious food comfy bed lovely breakfast,1
 staff on arrival completely unhelpful my room and bed were extremely small and poorly located on the ground floor with smells from the kitchen and noise from inside and out i enquired about upgrading i was willing to pay the extra but despite having other rooms available i checked online they would not allow me to change rooms very poor customer service and a strange attitude if they d allowed me to upgrade they would have received more income and would have had a satisfied customer ,0
 1 hygiene problem we found mold in our breakfast jam jar after the incident we tried to cancel our breakfast for the next coming days but they refused to and said they will consider it not until we rreported to ihg in regards to this issue then the hotel agreed to refund the breakfast 2 broken glass in the hallway outside our room for two days we saw the broken glass and expected someone to clean it up but no one had it cleaned until we reported to the reception to avoid any severe injuries 3 housekeeping was not trained well the doors were not closed properly after service many times and room supplies was not properly filled everyday we had to remind them to bring certain things that they forgot to put in our room everyday not to mention the organization of the room regarding the bed sheets things on the table were not properly placed 4 guest relations they did not solve any problems of which we complained about until we reached ihg during check out i had to argue with the guest relation staff member about the cancelled breakfast that i had confirmed days ago service and attitude was disappointing ,0
 the pic and the right location is wrong from booking com,0
 1 i was meant to be paying 79 but they charged me a extra 50 on arrival for a deposit they said would be returned the following day nothing has been returned nothing showed up in terms of the booking either 2 location it says it shoreditch yet its 15 20 mins walk away from shoreditch and its actually bethenal green still 10 mins away from that tube stop also 3 the hotel was advertised as a 4 star yet the carpets in the room wasn t nice the tv s was portable s and didn t work the bath was ok but the plug didn t work and hot water still come out when i ve turned it to cold 4 lots of noise in the hotel and they did nothing to quieten down i m very annoyed customer who feels cheated,0
 i had been told parking would be available but it wasn t so had to pay a lot more money to use another car park hadn t been advised of the building work taking place effecting the parking no very early breakfast available for those taking part in cycle event despite the hotel being full of cyclists no fridges in room to keep items cold as no early breakfast available decor in room was extremely tired and tatty in places bath jacuzzi didn t work ,0

 perfect location for london eye and lovely walks along the south bank i ll be going back soon lovely hotel the room we had included a little kitchen with microwave which is very useful ,1
 lovely hotel with super clean rooms efficient staff and all that you may need for a comfortable and pleasant stay the room was of a fair size with comfortable bed the only drawback was no possibility of opening the window but this is a minor thing as most people prefer the air conditioning anyway overall a great place ,1

 the room the building the little details in and around the hotel were very nice staff was friendly ,1
 after reading the reviews we booked a superior room we got a king size bed in a small room the air con was pathetic the free wi fi was ok when it worked and the glass we accidentally broke was left for 2 days and so were the shards of glass in the carpet breakfast was in the adjoining garfunkel who were more interested in the walk ins than the hotel guests needless to say we will not be staying here again ,0

 it needs refurbishment now without heating in london with 0 degrees was problem i got cold and two days i am out of the office they had a small additional rediator just to mention that i had an oil to apply for my moist ache and when i tried it was frozen like a cream this is unecceptable if they new that they have problem they should change our room if was general they should supply all rooms with bigger this is an excuse especially when you stay one night i asked the lady and she said they had problem so i do not care i could say the same that i have problem and i cannot pay them the heating is the most important next step is to claim my money from booking and i will do that ,0
 very friendly staff cleanliness of hotel very close only a 5mins walk to eventim appollo plenty of parking spaces ,1
 dirty room bedding changed three times noisy air vents in room so couldn t sleep,0
 i didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk we he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets the hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us the police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally i wouldn t recommend the hotel i had saved to take my boyfriend to london ,0
 the hotel was clean and comfort ,1
 the location is just great with waterloo station close to the hotel london eye 4 min walk hotel and staff great,1
 public rooms were beautiful ,1
 management is arrogant and unhelpfull breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there reception is eager to add costs ,0
 the info for the rooms is not clear the room is so small,0
 the pillow was to soft and they did not provide a meduim pillow the room too small the niose from the other gusts and the house keeping staff ,0
 location near the underground station was good,1
 service at reception was poor could not find booking for 15 minutes only one room available when checking in room 101 so reception gave that room to our friends even though we did the booking we were allocated room 609 later in the day the room was smaller than room 101 and was extremely noisey preventing reasonable sleep why was i given the worst room when i made the booking and paid for it we were told it was a room upgrade so i dread to think what the original room was like paid 170 for the room was not worth 100 would like a refund please,0
 nice rooms and clean,1
 comfy bed great staff love the location and the fact the hotel has car parking facilities,1
 amazing location the staff were so friendly and couldn t do enough for you food in the restaurant was lovely,1

 room was dreadful i had to climb over the bed to get to the other side roof at a very awkward angle meant i couldn t stand up next to the bed i m 5 7 bathroom very small booking com says room contains large double bed queen size however i am certain we were in a double booking com also says room is 35 square feet not sure what they were measuring paid a reasonably high price for a very uncomfortable stay we were unable to open a window and airconditioner cannot be changed to blow cool air which meant we had only a few hours sleep each day as we kept waking up sweating used concierge to arrange airport transfer however upon checking back 12 hours later found it had not been done ,0
 the location is excellent the exterior of the hotel has beautiful architecture ,1
 room noisy over price service,0
 the room which was prepaid had to be ready and clean for me at 12 00 i checked in at 16 30 still they were cleaning it returned at 18 30 still were looking for my room as it was not ready at last they gave me a room with a great view but totally dirty awful floors dirty toilettes and asked for an adaptor and requested a credit card the towels in the bathroom should have been cleaned and replaced whereas the toiletries were the lowest quality no crabtree evelyn the entrance of the hotel was so dirty you could hardly see it room service awful the concierge was not even responding in the phone asked for sbody to come pick up my luggage at the check out and even after 20 no one showed up i used to stay in this hotel in the past no comparison to how it was a true disappointment ,0

 the hotel was a 15 minute walk from kings cross station with a suitcase this was a nightmare ended up spending more money on taxi fare and buses hotel staff in reception were not very pleasant and very abrupt never smiled and almost seemed irritated with me asking questions main toilets in the hotel were on level 1 in a hotel room as they were having a refurbishment when arriving at the hotel in the morning i couldnt check in until 2pm and needed the toilet what they didnt tell you was you needed a pass and anyone could just walk in very strange and i was not advised of any of this upon checking in overall very disorganised and customer service not great ,0

 our room was robbed using housekeeping key proved via access logs which hotel managers could not link to any of employees managers of the hotel did not provide any apologize just were saying that this could not happen room was robbed at 1pm in the middle of a day hotel staff refused to show who entered exit the hotel around this time and provide informmation what other rooms were accessed using this unknown housekeeping key explaining that this is too hard to do for them hotel staf was refusing to assist me calling the police and said that this is my problem and i should care about that summarizing staying in this hotel be prepared that your room could be accessed using unregister housekeeping key and nobody of hotel staff will take responsibility for such poor security,0
 excellent location close to the famous spots but quieter than living right around them ,1
 location of the hotel was near the tube station it had a good wifi,1
 the staff were rude the rooms are dull and dingy no fresh air in the rooms and it was really humid and hot so had to sleep with ac on and woke with sore throat have stayed in club quarters lincolns inn and the staff are amazing and the place is like a palace compared to this dump shower was dirty i do have pictures but don t have time to post right now ,0

 noisy dismissive staff grumpy staff can t wait to get out of here ,0
 the hotel is in a quiet neighborhood very close to the earl s court tube station great breakfast very nice staff clean and comfotable,1
 if you get a room on the 2nd floor located over strand street the traffic noise is so loud it is impossible to sleep during the night the windows of this 4 star hotel are absolutely not sound proof ,0
 very friendly staff very family friendly,1
 reception room design no room service no bar staff,0
 friendly helpful staff comfortable room great location,1
 room was not ready at 1600 hrs as it was still being cleaned advertised on site guests could check in after 1500 hrs key cards needed to be cut twice as they did not work room was small and shabby the wardrobes were scuffed and the doors were wobbly all looked very tired the hair dryer was broken and i had to request a new one unable to have breakfast on saturday morning as the queue was approx 30 minutes and queuing down the stairs the staff informed us the dining room is too small for the number of guests they have and are unable to cope ,0
 some of the staff had poor command of english language checking in and out seemed very complicated room very basic lots of little faults,0
 avoid this hotel terrible service room smelled like cigarettes missed fireworks cause keys didn t work had to walk 20 mins to hotel cause roads shut down for annual event no warning to us whatsoever terrible value only way to see eiffel tower from our room was to lean out over balcony and look far right room pictures and view misleading no a c or wasn t working avoid this hotel ,0
 location,1
 i like the beautiful old world feel of this hotel respect for the character of the building the service at breakfast was excellent the staff were generally friendly and professional my room was lovely and very comfortable the location is very good ,1
 the view was great the staff were very haplfull ,1
 room was beautiful gym was great ,1
 bed comfy breakfast great,1
 the room was incredibly small with very basic offerings it was very cold when we first arrived and the heating was not working until we called someone to come and fix it ,0
 staff very rude and not friendly ,0
 the staff where incredibly rude and unhelpful the hotel was in an incredibly poor condition and it is disgraceful it is rated as a 4 star hotel the worst hotel i have ever stayed in while travelling the world for the past 25 years ,0
 bed very comfortable ac system working very well during the days i stayed which were very hot location excellent just 10 minutes walking to notre dame and easy to reach from the airport wit the rer b ,1
 our first room smelt of sewage there was no source of cold drinking water as the taps were hot only and there was no minibar we had to wait 20minutes to be seated at breakfast before another waiter falsely accused us of stealing a table very upsetting and there was very little breakfast on offer with flies in the drinking water ,0
 we arrived at 15 00 and the rooms were not ready the duvet cover in my room was damp the other residents on my floor were very inconsiderate and noisy throughout the night the breakfast came with salad why oh why ,0
 staff were so polite the moment we arrived room was amazing and overall experience was the best i have had in hotel view of docklands from the bar at night is stunning ,1
 the staff were very friendly and polite front desk was always there at anytime clean and descent hotel just at the right location the area was safe and quit ,1
 room size is ridiculous one could access the bed from 1 side only and the free side of the room had space for a suitcase so one had 2 options have the suitcase or pass through moving the suitcase away no a c just a ventilator 21 small tv radio with iphone dock iphone 4 however fungus in the bathroom there was a chair in the room no idea what for as there was no space to sit on it i have stayed in many hotels in london even the more central have had bigger rooms the quiet side of the hotel was facing the train station so at night one could choose between the heat or loud noises from the trains i honestly cannot understand how this hotel can have a 4 rating no space to turn around in the room no ac no mini bar it would not have fitted anyways the pictures and other ratings are really deceiving ,0
 stayed here 10 years ago and it was a slightly old fashioned hotel with moody staff they have since refurbished many of the rooms and wrecked the old charm of the hotel it s still got the moody staff very unhelpful never even showed us to our room just said it was on the 2nd floor breakfast was 21 per person for a croissant and coffee so we skipped that there are plenty of excellent cafes nearby where you can get better for 6 on leaving the hotel we walked out having paid without so much as a goodbye from the staff all very odd ,0
 location location location nice and clean room friendly staff good use of space,1
 the air conditioning was barely working they told me that paris never experiences outdoor temperatures like those 35c which is a total lie the motor was simply inadequate opening the window to get some fresh air from the outside instead was impossible because of the people on the street and in the bars enjoying themselves there are no ironing facilities in the room i went downstairs to get an iron and the guy had to run across the street to get one the rooms are small i was on the top floor and even if i m only 175cm i could barely fit my head under the shower paying all that money and having so little comfort is unacceptable ,0
 kitchenette in room great idea,1
 everything,1
 gold ring was missed after they clean the room also they need to charge me 100 euro for cleaning the room ,0
 no lift available,0
 location,1
 staff are not friendly at all and not supportive i asked for brush teeth even they didnot be able to bring it my room and in the second day i went down to bring it room is so so small and at all not same as photo prices is so high just because of location in generla it was bad experience there ,0
 close to a lot of things and that added walk will do you the world of good although on fleet street it s tucked away and suffers little from street traffic noise the bed was probably the best i have ever slept in ,1
 staff where helpful,1
 location staff friendliness beautiful architecture of building inside room a little bit small not that we spent too much time in there ,1
 i was charged twice on a preauthorisation for the total cost of my stay and that was not reversed during my 5 day stay the staff blamed the credit card company but nothing to release almost a 1000 that i was unable to spend during my holiday due to their mistake gross incompetence and no customer service skills displayed at all 6 days later and 2 days after leaving the amount is still on my card no mention of full prepayment at the time of check in and it was suggested that this was a precaution against me not settling my account treated like a criminal with no parole period never ever again will i either stay here not will i ever recommend the hotel to anyone despite its great location ,0
 wonderful staff and location there is a cool stylish atmosphere,1
 location in a quiet street location to the tube and local shops,1
 excellent location for the hammersmith apollo,1
 we were three travelers and the room was pretty tight for three people but that is europe for you the location was very close to notre dame and it was very easy to walk everywhere in the city great restaurants nearby friendly bilingual staff we were on the top floor and a heavy rain storm resulted in the ceiling leaking over the third bed they immediately provided an extra room for my dad for no additional charge wifi worked perfectly took the train metro to the airport due to traffic which was great location about an hour from airport which would have been an extremely expensive cab ride we chose to get breakfast at nearby restaurants so can t comment on the food ,1

 you can here the tube even if you re not trying to,0
 the room,0
 the treatment of the staff is extremely bad and does not deserve yhe value of the money even though we were in a club room,0
 the property is decadent in a bad way cleanliness is very poor and the staff expecially italian one is rude and bad with guests no concierge service at all and a worst welcoming ever i do not recommend at all ,0
 they were oveebooked put us in a beautiful room the first night tried to charge us extra but we refused then moved us to a booking com floor for the last 4 nights bed was worst we ve ever slept in and bathroom was in disrepair it was like we were in a different hotel ,0
 the staff hotel ambience comfort location ,1
 excellent location if you re planning on visiting the o2 it s literally a walkway away gorgeous views and immaculate room hotel is located in a very peaceful and quiet area lovely d cor to make you feel at home and great bathroom with a powerful shower staff are accommodating at all times and provide exceptional customer service breakfast was divine couldn t fault my stay at all ,1
 it s not a nice hotel and not worth the money even the room the house keeping came at 6 pm,0
 very clean,1
 the decor and furniture was nice as was the bathroom ,0
 the chefs in the manhatton grill ate dinner but didn t bother staying for breakfast didn t want to chance it after seeing how they perform,0
 by far the worst customer service i have experienced at check in ,0
 great location spacious studio room with a fab view of the london eye an unexpected bonus ,1
 truly awful room on 2nd floor dark old and worn furnishings everything had seen better days and looked like it needed a scrub clean so disappointing as had taken a friend to london for a fun night out and this room was an embarrassment not 4 star standard and far too expensive for the state no free wifi which is ridiculous for a hotel of this supposed level i stayed in 3 hotels in london this week and this was by far the worst receptionist said they are in the process of a refurbishment but don t charge those prices if the room is so crap would not go back ,0
 we had the specific pleasure of having a wonderful concierge agostinho he went out of his way to do anything he could for us he helped book and hand pick theater seats for us for 4 plays arrange a trip to the cotswolds and just in general gave us tips on places to eat and where to go with very specific directions ,1
 staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena,1
 loved the up grade to a junior suite,1
 rooms were dirty old and tired bed was a disgrace linen was horrendous room in road no insulation from noise bells from st paul s ring all night again no insulation so no sleep,0
 every thing bad from service to cleaning the room,0
 great breakfast good sized room,1
 in a terrible loacation did not feel safe leaving or returning to the hotel at night staff were very rude and we were woken up at 1am by staff thinking the room was empty very unorganised and very rude ,0
 the staff where helpful and friendly,1
 the hotel was expensive for the location and how bad it is room was to small for a double hotel was not clean bed was hard and uncomfortable,0
 best ever stay cannot fault it in anyway,1
 at first i thought i was walking into a bar not a welcoming layout however the concierge was very pleasant booked executive twin room told room ready at check in however set up as double had to go to reception twice offered another room which i had to view with a member of staff didn t like this room the first room was changed by a maintenance man while we were unpacking bathroom had glass fronted sliding door with no ventilation which rattled when opening very curious given the decor of the room and which must have been designed by a contortionist the room was not what i would call executive very disappointed ,0
 the bedsheets are dirty the cushions are dirty the tissues has not been refilled even though i have requested several times during my stay for 8 days there are two bathrooms in the apartment but the water pressure is extremely low and not strong enough for using both of them in the same time the cooking utensils in kitchen are dirty the balcony is dirty with a lot of cigarette butts on the ground and plant pot the cleaning staff always forgets to clear all the rubbish bins for each floors ,0
 the hotel has plenty period charm and the threatre bar is unique ,1
 the actual room we eventually got was amazing even though we had to pay an upgrade because it wasn t in the price bracket of the one we had initially booked the receptionist was very helpful but i don t know what would have happened if we had not paid the additional upgrade to get a better room ,1
 the room was really large by london standards well planned out great modern decor a balcony to sit outside on nespresso machine elemis toiletries friendly helpful staff very clean good location right on fleet st would stay again,1
 water bottles were charged at the high rate,0
 lovely hotel great location clean with friendly staff,1
 really liked the hotel and location ,1
 great location for sightseeing south bank near underground for covent gardens theatre land lovely hotel great value for money would definitely use again ,1
 i booked what they described as a family room picture showed what was described but when we got there holy crap far from what was shown this room looked like a storage room or some kind of utility room made up to look like a family room it was hideous there was a glass door with crash bar handle that led out to a stairwell at the back of the property did not feel safe when i checked in there were light fixtures missing so the bulbs were exposed wallpaper peeling off the wall and the carpet was stained the air conditioning was not blowing well even though they swear it was a maximum shape i sent an email to the manager after the first night and she did respond back and talked to me at the property but did not off any discount or anything to compensate for the shoddy room the desk clerk i first made my complaint to was rude and very unconcerned about my issues the location is very busy and suspicious people hang out there i don t understand how this hotel can be rated 4 stars and have short comings like this the hotel blamed booking for the pictures i informed them that the pictures were from the property not people who upload i paid way too much for this nasty room and would ask that booking ensure the hotels are representing the properties accurately it doesn t make sense for people to travel far to enjoy themselves and be subjected to an uncomfortable room i want a refund ,0
 the staff of the hotel useless the did not bothers at all of my request they promise to do it but they did not many times and they lies a lot even no coffee or tea in the room after cleaning or room service fridge it was out of order they promised to fix it but the never send the engineer to my room even i have been reported many time to the hotel reception,0
 the hotel is beautiful inside and out staff were very friendly and approachable ,1
 staff rooms price,0
 location brilliant for the o2 islington very quiet area but close to the center of london if you were here a while,1
 location is great right across from opera garnier a few mins walk to galleries lafayette n rue de saint honore where all the boutiques are located beds were very comfortable n hermes toiletries were good ,1
 i left a transparent small plastic bag on the table in my room containing small paper items such as my parking ticket in dublin airport receipts dockets etc which were removed by housekeeping and presumably dumped they should not have been touched and their removal caused me huge problems when trying to retrieve my car from the long term car park in dublin airport also other items of record which i needed to retain have been destroyed i made a complaint to reception on my departure which was met with a shoulder shrug from the girl who couldn t wait to see the back of me hilton s customer service at reception was woeful and utterly uncaring i was even charged 12 for wifi in my room which they should have waived as a first gesture to acknowledge their cock up overall very disappointing ,0
 advertisement is deceiving room was poor ,0
 dirty uncomfortable broken air conditioning stuck at 28 8 cheap pillows dirty everything,0
 gym and pool facilities,1
 the staff at eighteen bar were very friendly polite and helpful,1
 drinks seemed over the top more than other hotels in london,0
 room freezing despite mobile heater carpets dirty lifts unreliable,0
 close to many of the london attractions ,1
 there was damage to the air conditioning device marks on the walls and the little extras were not there as described i will be writing a letter of complaint to the company,0
 close to wide choice of restaurants and the tube and kensington gardens a great place to be ,1
 very old furniture smelly room bad service call them several times to get what you asked ,0
 the hotel is situated at a place very close to the train station but very unsafe because my purse containing all my belongings 4 passports all cash 2500 euros 1600 swiss francs 1000 aed 4 emirates i d s credit card camera watch iphone etc was stolen within seconds when i was talking to the receptionist in the hotel lobby at the time of checkout the hotel personnel refused to take any credibility refused to show the cctv footage tried to tear the police report on the pretext of taking photocopies for us i still have the torn copies even telling the indian consulate that this did not happen in the hotel i am pretty sure that the hotel staff is in collusion with the thieves as the receptionist saw what was happening as there was no else around me at that time it was a terrible experience and i do not want anyone else facing the same please be very careful staying in this hotel ,0
 the staff was disorganised during check in and at times even rude request for rooms on the same floor was met with a flat non without even offering to look at whether this could be facilitated during part of the stay the double rooms are too small and are too expensive for their size especially as breakfast is not included in the price ,0
 the staff were not helpfull couldn t go in the gardens had randomly closed it as they pleased and never turned the lights on so was always dull out but that was not what i read when i booked the hotel water and coffe were over priced the only clean part of the hotel was the lobby i hated my experience in this hotel would never go back even the extractor fans in the bathrooms did not work ,0

 room705 the bed was really comfy loved the bathroom and just the room in general room service was nice breakfast was good too didn t want to check out ,1
 the tv didn t work it was 10pm and i needed to sleep to get back to the office at 5am so didn t bother calling to get it replaced cos as we all know that would have taken 4 hours ordered room service and it was squid and soup wouldn t have fed that to my dogs cold slimey just disgusting the bathroom was a disabled bathroom with weird toilet horrendous all the way through looked like a bathroom you d find in cheap looney bin ,0
 great location near the underground 5 breakfast room size consider good when compared to london hotels super fast wifi,1
 very old hotel uncomfortable bed old room and its not like a 5 star hotel its 3 star in my opinion i will not recommend this hotel at all ,0

 the price mark up was unrealistic same price for a bottle of water and a beer ,0
 the best thing was the friendliness of the staff and willingness to help the pool in the spa was clean and pleasant ,1
 no view of the square staying for a week one expects a decent fully functional and clean room bar fridge mouldy housekeeping very hit and miss gym very average and poor opening hours for an international hotel rooms were tired and bland no door staff and had to fight your way through smokers standing around the entrance poor maintenance planning and vleaning,0

 grandeur of the entrance lounge bar,1

 the staff is fantastic very friendly and helpful thank you iulian ,1
 everything was great me and my partner had planned a short visit to just be with each other and the place was perfect for that i will highly recommend this hotel ,1
 the room was not more than 6 sqm probably with a very tiny bathroom i could barely walk in the room i could only open my suitcase if i put it on the bed the bed mattress were bery bad i had severe backpain in the morning you could not turn on the air conditioning as it blew right into your face breakfast was really basic i do not understand why it has such high score probably because hotels in london are bad in general ,0
 the hotel was in a very good location the room was very comfortable and the staff was excellent,1
 the facilities,1
 insects all around the room dirty bathroom air conditioning was not use full at all wouldn t recommend anyone to get a room in that hotel stay away l ,0
 windows not sound proof and also not closing properly so there is a constant draft from outside and very noisy from the road reception staff not very friendly we arrived one hour before check in time but she didn t even bother checking if the room was ready or not she told us to wait until 2 pm sharp the room was not a double room but also not a twin room just two independent tiny beds on wheels that move during your sleep ,0
 practical location near to underground comfort of the bed very good breakfast for 12 if booked upon arrival instead of 15 impressive architecture and decoration at entrance and 1st floor ,1
 been previously recently been rebranded everything was excellent,1
 we had a spectacular city view in a quiet and comfy suite the overall circulation areas and corridors were light and airy during our stay we enjoyed attentive service were delighted to receive prompt response to our special request for a room with a view well done big thanks to all ,1
 room was hot and cooling system wasn t suffice,0
 i loved our room it was very spacious nice decor we had a beautiful view of the london eye which looked great at night the staff were polite and friendly they made us feel welcome with little touches such as a birthday card for me and complimentary wine they also gave us a free upgrade on our room which was great the breakfast was good on both days we had it a good variety of different foods ,1
 room with no windows,0
 staff were friendly efficient helpful,1
 the beds were very comfy lovely clean fresh room very friendly staff breakfast was plentiful and tasty only criticism the cooked items were not hot enough but i appreciate its hard to maintain high temps on a hot plate service ,1
 my 4th but now final stay at the park plaza county hall what has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations 4 night stay in a studio king family with plenty of issues 1 studio king is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation 2 lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor 10 15mins the lift simply prioritises higher floors every time yes there are stairs but with a 7 month pregnant wife i shouldn t have to rely on them 3 breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace 10 15 mins average wait for a table 4 temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool 5 shower water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum 6 concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting 15 mins i had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time 7 lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel all in all an absolute joke yes i understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation what was my go to central london hotel is now a never again hotel ,0
 we were fortunate enough to be given a room up grade the room was excellent and well appointed very comfortable ,1
 staff were amazing friendly and go above and beyond to make sure your stay was excellent,1
 the bathroom was tiny and crammed not for overweight guests also bedroom crammed even with a double bed had clamber over the bed to get in it,0
 great location near to metro cleanliness of room and bathtub separate from shower and separate from bathroom ,1
 great location to explore the city good size suite for the entire family could do with a toaster but may be a fire hazard otherwise good to have a kitchenette ,1
 location heated outdoor smoking area breakfast is good just 2 min walk to earls court station halal restaurants are very close by ,1
 internet didn t work which i needed for work staff just told me to go to starbucks ,0
 the rooms were old and dingy and the bed was so uncomfortable and kept moving resulting in me picking my pillows up from the back of the bed several times in the night the bathroom was awful and every time the tap was turned on and off it literally shook the bathroom the view from our room was old and battered walls overall not worth the money and i would not stay here again ,0
 this hotel is likely japanese business hotel as the room is small and does have luxuary of 4 stars and some people attitude of hotel staffs is not kind and not friendly,0
 location clean nice staff,1
 we loved the size of the bedroom the bathroom was also lovely great roomy shower too ,1
 great location spacious and well appointed room ,1
 room small sure it was a single will not stay again ,0
 everything was ok the place was very clean comfortable and the location very convenient ,1
 first night almost no heating after complaint a bit better second night but still cold second night wifi stopped working they put me through to the provider bitbuzz to sort it out myself i had to help them understand they had a problem with the router they said they would call me back once fixed but they never did eventually it was fixed but i only found out late at night few sockets in the room and in weird locations no socket in bathroom main light could be switched off only from one side of bed,0
 air conditioning hard to control and noisy,0
 bar staff unable to open or pour champagne without spilling at least half a glass and still charged for the whole thing very poor dining room unable to cater for the amount of guests and nowhere to wait apart from 2 chairs right next to the cold buffet ,0
 fresh sheets clean bathroom hotel bar and very very very helpful front of house staff and nice bartender ,1
 nearby hammersmith the hotel have all the things you need no negative surprises ,1
 lots of things went wrong i did not like how the toilet roll bracket came off the wall i did not like how the shower fitting was unstable and at a diagonal angle i did not like how the curtain rail fell of the wall when the curtain was drawn back the bedside cabinet came apart when i moved it slightly to get my phone charger but above all these points the air conditioning wasn t working so it was incredibly hot during the night and with paddington police station opposite made for an impossible night s sleep ,0
 came to see billy connolly at the hammersmith apollo our check in check out were both hassle free and easy with helpful friendly staff room was clean comfortable and we had a good nights sleep there was a really good choice at breakfast and plenty of seating well located for the underground too so we could do a little sightseeing would definitely stay again ,1
 lovely period hotel staff were accomodating ,1
 after asking not to get one of the rooms downstairs during my booking they still put me in one of them and it is horrible it is in a building on the other side of the street the room was very smelly and dark it is right under the stairs so also very loud rooms are small and the view of this one was basically right to the air conditioning machine running every 10mn literally in front of the window very annoying and loud the windows were not helping at all so you have to keep the curtains closed showers were not very clean and also one of them was broken water leaking when people upstairs would take their shower they changed me on the second day to another room upstairs 2nd floor but it was still very loud because of the air conditioning girls at the reception are helpful and nice but this hotel is not a 4stars hotel and i would most definitely not recommend it ,0
 the bed was comfy the room was clean ,1
 hawa at the front desk was rude and impatient as we were checking out she kept on making comments under her breath which made me feel really uncomfortable,0
 very clean friendly staff ,1
 attractive hotel great location great staff,1
 staff and location awesome,1
 no complaints at all ,1
 they told be i had a room without a window never heard of hotel room without window so i upgraded to room with window we had to be moved from the upgraded room at 1 45am as the air con was broken and room was 27 degrees there was no maintenance staff on site to open our window the third room we moved to had people next door as it had adjoining door that started talking and arguing at 5 30am so we basically had no sleep someway to spend our second anniversary you at booking com have a responsibility to us your clients to make sure we get a service for our money 170 and i expect you to get my money refunded i use your service at least 10 times a year so i expect respect from you regards tony,0
 very polite staff ,1
 everything,0
 great location,1
 the rooms were badly cleaned old and poorly maintained gym was very too busy insufficient staff at breakfast too many groups ,0
 the location the feeling of welcome the staff gave us they were very helpful the family room was very roomy and comfortably its was very good for us to have a laundry room ,1
 very clean well presented room comfortable bed and excellent shower facilities ,1
 friendly staff nice and clean modern great central location and excellent breakfast,1
 the room had mice,0
 dirty old filthy does not deserve one star should not even be on your list,0
 don t be fooled by the marketing you can get a much better value more central with staff who can actually help suggest things to do offer directions call you a cab etc wifi didn t work the entire time we were there making any work or activity planning nearly impossible lots of stairs staff not helpful with billing issues ,0
 great location close to paddington good for airport connection and to hyde park as well as a lot of tube lines very friendly staff ,1
 cracks in ceiling room had old decor from 80s room smelt foul mood in bathroom bathroom flooded no drainage could barley walk in room staff un willing to change room went and stayed in jumeirah in stead ,0
 there is no air conditioning and i was in an internal room like being in a boiling hot cell sink in room broken when i spoke to the reception on check out no apology no offer of discount they knew about the air conditioning not working the hotel is going through refurbishment and blamed the website for not informing potential bookers ,0
 friendly staff,1
 location location location ,1
 stayed here two weekends running for concerts at o2 couldn t be a more perfect location for that fabulous views of canary wharf from some rooms rooms spacious and well equipped separate shower cubical and bath small point but so nice to have 3 hand towels in a bathroom for two so you have one dedicated for washing hands a small attention to detail but speaks volumes had breakfast delivered to the room for both stays which comes beautifully presented see photo with proper linen napkins and table cloth etc check out is 12pm so if you have had a late night you can have a nice relaxing morning breakfast in your room before heading off lots of food options around the o2 plus a pharmacy and tesco express ,1
 we got the most beautiful room with four windows facing the streets of paris wonderful views the staff is very friendly the bed is comfortable we had a great time ,1
 good sized bed lady who checked us in was very friendly and helpful,1
 it is not in the standard of a marriott hotel no robes no slippers no stationery housekeeping so so,0
 everything,0
 first bedroom had a disgusting smell second bedroom had excrement covering the wc,0
 they charged me twice without any notice me in the beginning and fortunately then cancelled the second transaction until i found out that twice the amount was reserved at my account therefore i wasn t able to use my other money and wait for the reservation to be cancelled i asked them in advance to provide me with a room option that had a big single bed and a shower but instead they just gave me a room with a bath tub and twin bed the room needs a renovation and to be more tidy overall i wouldn t recommend anyone to stay at this hotel and use services of h10 chain ,0
 although we made reservation beforehand we were refused in accommodation due to some mistake in marriott system they offered us another hotel for one night after which we were to move to marriott ,0
 we thoroughly enjoyed our stay the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful and our room was very nice the bed the most comfortable we have had in all the hotels we have stayed in there is also every facility you may need we would most definitely stay here again location also excellent ,1
 the size of the studio is very good and location is excellent,1
 clean room,1
 the curtain tie back were held together with paper clips the breakfast wasn t very hot,0
 not good value for money if that was a superior room i would hate to have seen the size of a standard double room for the price we paid breakfast should have been included have stayed in much better hotels than this paid alot less really wish that we hadn t bothered with the weekend break not memorable at all ,0
 staff friendly clean,1
 location dirty,0
 we were attending a concert at the o2 so the location could not have been any better everyone we meet was very polite and profectional and facilities could t have been improved views and breakfast were wonderfull ,1
 all,0
 position and period style of the hotel,1
 my double room was ridiculously small i had read the rooms were small so had thankfully paid extra for a double on arrival there was no cupboard space not even to hang a coat or dress only a small space for a few shirts nowhere to put luggage so was tripping over bags in the tiny space impossible to imagine two people having to share this room the bathroom was also very snug and smelt of cat pee the shower doesn t drain properly and therefore floods the towels were small rough and not good quality no excuse for this and easy to remedy bed was hard and tv reception came and went am really surprised that booking com had given this hotel 4plus stars would really not recommend not good value for money ,0
 club room very clean comfortable bed and a spotless bathroom,1
 everything else,0
 great location nearby the waterloo train and metro station as well as the london eye very quiet and comfortable ,1
 very small rooms the hotel upztairs is old ans not renovated the price for this kind of room was very high cleanliness not the best sink was stuck and water could not come out,0
 the air condition is very good clean and tidy room the staff are friendly and helpful lots of italian restaurants around and i found 3 local shops nearby ,1
 very comfortable room very pleasant staff warm and cosy surroundings ,1
 very poor service across the board from all the staff very small rooms with poor lighting uncomfortable beds ,0
 location is excellent and quite easy accessible for tourists travelling by car with parking in the vicinity staff diligent and responsive rooms are well equipped and they have a nice hotel bar ,1
 very old furniture and small rooms room door will not close very bad veiw on carabage area rude waitress supervisor at the breakfast buffet expensive hotel rooms for such a small and old place no shampo or conditionar ,0
 stayed at this hotel several times awesome ,1
 d cor dated and need of a huge overhaul,0
 nice courtyard sun trap when fine,1
 complimentary wine was a lovely touch for a young couple that wanted a cheap spontaneous get away ,1
 nice breakfast even though it was busy ,1
 was advised to switch rooms to have two single beds at the check in as we would get a window view the view was of pipes and the window wouldn t even open was told we could push the two beds together but all night they just kept sliding apart and we were barely able to sleep the ac was very noisy and if we turned it off the room got uncomfortably warm found dust in the room and there was no was no toothpaste or toilet brush in the bathroom people in the rooms nearby were very loud at times at night any it resulted in us having s very disrupted sleep not the first time that i ve stayed here so i am very disappointed ,0
 staff were excellent nothing was a problem ,1
 great view from my hotel room ,1
 amazing hotel ,1
 the main issue was that some kind of plumbing water pressure issue caused terrible noise through the night meaning very poor night sleep i was given a new room next night but the same problem existed in fact it was worse nothing was offered to me as an apology recompense first room was in a basement with no window and was tiny breakfast was pretty poor too ,0
 breakfast great lots of choice quality of food excellent staff friendly,1
 room over an hour late and staff not my problem attitude,0
 aircon in the room does not work no way to open window staff unhelpful and did not sleep,0
 car parking fee to high,0
 old rooms bad facilities,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy ,1
 brilliant,1
 their herm s range of toiletries are surely good the staff at the concierge and the reservation desk are very courteous and helpful ,1
 we had the benefit of being upgraded because of a broken shower in the room originally booked excellent indian restaurant very friendly and normally helpful staff good continental breakfast for a good price large number of staff lot of storage room due to clever use of space ,1
 im not even a fussy person nor a complainer however i hated hated hated every single minute here they bought me to tears no value for money disgraceful extremely rude staff and service the place is ran like a shambles i would compare it to a cheap east london hotel management treated us like utter rubbish they are so sly conniving sarcastic and have a ugly tone in their voice we felt so so low our whole day was ruined because of the way they spoke to us we even caught them lying to us one of the rare kind members of staff told us in confidence that this is a new hotel and they ve got a long way to go in terms of service and spec and that he completely agreed that we were right in everything we said their own staff agree there is a big big problem we booked the king deluxe room so expected at least a little bit of politeness cleanliness but no instead of any politeness we got the complete opposite came in and brown dust in our bath tub and behind it we were so so put off our stay started off with the worst room service food ever ive stayed in all kinds of hotels around the world but the food here is disgusting and dry and not to mention cold and hard couldn t even chew the chicken the lady who came in to serve us the food didn t even say hello just shoved the table in and left not even a smile we thought its odd how she behaved but decided to ignore it and carry on after the disgusting dinner roast chicken dishes we decided to rest to get rid of that sickly feeling from our mouth knock on the door standing there is the management three of them looking like the fbi all stern angry faced with ear pieces in quot we believe you have a kitten in the room they stared off rudely we smiled meekly and told them that the concierge had allowed us to bring the kitten a birthday gift to myself inside the building ,0
 the room club room was much smaller than described here amenities are old and the overall cleaning is not good the elevator was not working half of the time of my stay at the time of checkout the personnel was trying to convince other clients to leave positive comments here and on tripadvisor which is probably the only reason why this hotel is featured on booking com would not recommend ,0
 everything staff lovely room very nice breakfast excellent,1
 comfortable beds good toiletries superb food and service ,1
 absolutely loved this stay the bathroom and modern decor in the rooms was right on point for us loved the shower too ,1
 poor housekeeping service they kept leaving garbage in our room we called for housekeeping and they didn t come for hours they left used mugs in the room and didn t replace them with new ones charge 5 to bring clean fresh plates to your room ,0
 breakfast great staff very helpful and pleasant lovely location nice comfy clean room no bad remarks ,1
 1 i was leaving the hotel about 07 00 am on 23th of april 2016 there was only one person at the reception there was a line and i was in a hurry only after 07 00 arrived some additional staff they turned on computers it took a while when they started to work everything was done in a very slow pace i asked them why there was only one person at the reception and why they arrived so late but i received quite unpolite response that there was a change of a shift and no apologies at all 2 i was making some short video on my old phone for my family on a lobby of the hotel when security guy touched my shoulder in a quite rude way and told me that making video is prohibited by rules of the hotel it was so ridiculous like i was making video in a secret military property only after speaking to a manager they allowed me to do some video ,0
 worst services even mid night around 2am need water said come down pay money and take water in the bath room no toiletres available,0
 the staff are helpful and friendly the buffet breakfast had a lot of options evening there were a lot of guests the hotel was quiet and did not feel crowded ,1
 i ordered room service food and unfortunately received a lobster risotto instead of the mushroom risotto i had ordered i am vegetarian and also have a food intolerance to seafood so i spent most of the night with an upset stomach and in the bathroom i informed the reception twice of my predicament i was not offered any reduction on my food bill and i had to pay an extortionate amount for a lobster dish that i ate two spoonfuls of and that ruined my visit i have since attempted to contact the hotel three times once through email a second time through booking com and a third time through email again i have not received a response to any of my communications extremely poor customer service ,0
 breakfast was excellent bed was extra large and very comfortable location was perfect and very quiet ideal for the o2 arena,1
 the standard sized room was so tiny it is not comfortable to share with another person almost impossible to move insode the room without touching each other the closet space was size of an a4 paper it cannot be called a closet so we had to ask the staff to change our room but they were really not helpful and very unfriendly and implied us to be demanding finally we had to pay 30 euros per night to upgrade our room the new room they gave us was another case where there is no toilet in the bathroom toulet was located on the other side of the room it was the most uncomfortable hotel experience for me as if all these are not enough hotel concierge lost a document delivered to our name to the hotel it is definitely not value for money we were a group of 5 and had 3 rooms in total i was the one to choose the hotel after all this bitter experience i had hard time with my friends ,0
 the location is very near the earl s court station of piccadilly tube ,1
 rooms were very dated and old fashion,0
 excellent facilities the staff where amazing they made our anniversary stay extra special amazing afternoon tea as well,1
 location was great for the apollo and very easy for public transport underground and buses room was very clean breakfast good and staff were very attentive and friendly would definitely stay here again ,1
 quiet room great bathroom wonderful breakfast for 12 smoked salmon ,1
 great location,1
 very good location and great staff,1
 near from the metro,1
 probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in staff were excellent and very helpful from the doormen to the front of house staff the champagne and cake for a birthday treat was a very pleasant surprise ,1
 there was a issue with the breakfast we had previously booked they automatically upgraded our room without us even asking for anything,1
 very impressive customer service,1
 everything about the park grand was excellent from the moment we entered the door to the time we left we were made to feel welcome the room itself was fantastic comfortable immaculate and modern with everything you could possibly need the bathroom with underfloor heating was a lovely touch especially for my feet the restaraunt was lovely with a great choice of food and beverages wich were all very tasty couldn t fault the service here and will definitely be returning ,1
 my payment wasn t accepted as my father used his card to pay the initial bill so i had to pay on leaving major embarrassment the reimbursement has best come through promptly ,0
 everything else tiny room over looking a bin area and this was after a complimentary upgrade ,0
 requested extra pillows and got them a female front desk person was very attentive thin with dark hair ,1
 location awesome beautiful building ,1
 old and tired rooms air conditioning noisy value for money is a zero way too expensive for what you get,0
 the un sympathetic staff the window with a view of a steel wall literally the four single beds the noise from the elevators and work going on outside to far from tube station ,0
 the room wasn t clean and smelled bad no natural light i moved rooms and it wasn t much better breakfast was awful with hard croissants and scrambled eggs that were a strange shade of green staff obviously don t want to work there and that reflects in the service really dated d cor not deserving of a 4 star rating this hotel would be lucky to be considered 3 star ,0
 room was minuscule only just enough space to cram a single bed in don t use if you have any incling of claustophobia breakfast was canteen style far from palacial ,0
 familiar area and location everything was in perfect working order,1
 facilities very poor wardrobe doors hanging off bed very hard and uncomfortable pillows inadequate and bedding poor standard lack of tea and milk throughout stay staff under trained and not really interested in feedback on departure payment facilities very confusing ,0
 lovely hotel booked to attend a concert at the o2 which would have been ideal had the concert not been rescheduled got a non refundable rate so couldn t cancel hotel is lovely rooms are nice and clean with a huge bed travel in and out of the city was easy and would definitely recommend if your attending the o2,1
 all of it poky bedroom supposed to be a superior room shower room tiny cramped furniture was chipboard poor quality staff ignored our complaint about our room went to the lounge for coffee were directed to sit in the lobby to have it everything was over priced we were charged a city tax on leaving not informed before about this very poor value for money disappointing as this was an wedding anniversary break ,0
 we love the staff they are always kind and helpful also we love the location we feel we can go anywhere we want in london from this location ,1
 woke up with a dog poop in front of my door and they didn t even bother to apologize unqualified concierge that still used a book to find a restaurant which i found in a minute using google,0
 great to be located so close to both st michel and odeon stations also short distance to luxembourg gardens the staff at reception were really personable and helpful kids 19 and 16 yrs old appreciated and enjoyed the chocolates at reception had breakfast once at the hotel and it was great found the hotel to be homely yet efficient was good to get a triple room too which was really comfortable and not that easy to find ,1
 bathroom smell too much construction no storage space ,0
 great hotel nice lobby and bar area check in was very quick and efficient we stayed previous and they double scanned our card and took additional money that took some time to work out and have put back in our account so i would recommend paying upfront and not presenting a card for extras room was good size with comfy bed and good bathroom and shower facility good location a five to ten minute walk to hammersmith apollo and a five to seven minute walk to hammersmith tube station all in all a good stay ,1
 the staff was very nice the hotel is located close to restaurant and king s cross station and the room was spacious ,1
 central to what our plans were local to the bus station,1
 excellent location extremely central yet quiet due to being tucked away from the main street on the charming little square in front of sorbonne the rooms are modern and decently sized we re in paris all the staff is always very friendly helpful and professional the wifi works just fine the area is full of a perfect mix of interesting shops restaurants and sights to visit ,1
 room was quiet,1
 location style history staff,1
 room too small impossible for two people to get out of bed at once one side tight up against wall no where to put a reachable glass or cup stayed in better bedrooms in many other places ,0
 the room is old and not clean nothing in side the fridge no comlimentry water,0
 staff very friendly at reception there are also lots of facilities available if you wish to use them,1
 tired aged and scruffy basement room with no opening window inadequate air conditioning more like a dungeon than a hotel ,0
 the shower in the bathroom was super nice ,1
 the staff we re all very friendly and efficient breakfast was excellent the gentleman that welcomed us at the door was very very helpful ,1
 i thought the room was in a bad state of repair and well below that expected ,0
 was very busy when we arrived but the staff were very friendly and dealt with us efficiently room was clean and tidy no complaints whatsoever great location,1
 we didn t know the hotel was undergoing renovations and when mentioned this to the concierge all he could say was that everyone was complaining about it and that it was on their website which we hadn t used to book they also said work was happening 9 5 but on the second day we were woken before 8 30am with banging and drilling which was so loud the bed shook on the first day we ordered breakfast they sent the wrong one and by the time we got the correct one it was cold and rubbery it was a pretty stressful and unpleasant experience all round ,0
 this hotel was perfect for us we could walk to many sites and museums and the tube stop was right around the corner if we didn t walk it s a 10 minute walk to euston station or king s cross the hotel is very elegant with a beautiful lobby our room was really comfortable and quiet the bathroom was good sized we had a mini fridge and a tea kettle so we could have tea in our room the wifi was good really everything we needed to be comfortable was provided and we were in a great location we loved it and would definitely stay here next time we re in london ,1
 reservation confirmed but the hotel said they were fully booked when the guest arrived now another struggle with the unhelpful booking com s customer service ,0
 absolutely zero customer service no help with bags rooms are small and the housekeeping staff did the minimal amount of work that needed to happen tiny elevator that can have you waiting up to 10 minutes just to grab a space usually i am not too picky but so many things were off with this place don t even bother and it is not cheap ,0
 bedroom was stiflingly hot only temp control option was heating on or heating off no aircon and couldn t open window because of noisy heating unit outside we didn t sleep at all because of heat shower was very difficult to control without scalding oneself or flooding bathroom,0
 room lobby looked really cheap no windows should be a borderline 3 star hotel honestly ,0
 great location ,1
 lovely clean hotel enough staff around to tend to your needs breakfast was fabulous so much choice in again a big clean restaurant and plenty of staff available ,1
 could not image ,0
 lovely hotel great location and great price lots of staff around all if whom were vert pleasant and helpful what s not to like,1
 bed was very comfortable the place was clean staff good ,1
 clean romantic and location is amazing specially the balcony view ,1
 service room allocation,0
 liked almost everything except for the towels,1
 location it central,1
 i have never paid so much and received so little the reception staff at check in were very rude i had a problem with the shower and got blamed for mis using it the rooms are tiny stuffy and very warm this place is a disgusting rip off do not stay here unless you are really desperate ,0
 the worst room we ve ever stayed in 271 a night for an attic room on the 6th floor with no lift this wasn t a suite it was a broom cupboard central london with only single glazed windows therefore traffic noise kept us awake throughout the night very disappointing and misrepresented by the image and details on website requested earlier check in which hadn t been communicated ,0
 the shower was broken when we came back to the room the safe was opened and the maid was in the room i called down to front desk and the reception threatened me with violence ,0
 location is very old not invested in past years at some time this hotel must have seen glory but today it badly needs renovation ac was not working on a day of 40 deg in paris one can imagine ,0
 staff were really helpful room spotless breakfast brilliant,1
 a very tired and old hotel in desperate need of modernising,0
 the bed was awesome ,1
 everything,0
 not the breakfast,1
 very old classic hotel and really feels luxury the location is so good ,1
 i think the last time my room had any new furniture was the 80s ,0
 staff very helpful and professional plus friendly room better than expected ,1
 room was cold aircon not working and small bed uncomfortable pool was cold loud awful music playing in restaurant foyer and mezzanine area,0
 wifi doesn t work,0
 we booked as we were going to the eventim apollo and the location is perfect just a five minute walk the bed was really comfortable and the bar staff were very friendly great facilities and a great overnight stay it was a shame we were not staying longer ,1
 in love with the way staff treat me food is very tasty and wide variety for a breakfast room is always being cleaned good internet service on higher floors ,1
 hotel too hot no air conditioning meant windows open onto a very noisy street also no fridge full breakfast incredibly expensive at 24,0
 hotels in london are always very low quality this one really manages to come in a different higher standard ,1
 there was smoking on our floor despite being assured it was a non smoking room received 6 am wake up call on a sunday despite not ordering one cleaners started banging on the door at 8 30 came 4 times despite my telling them we were trying to sleep paid 26 euro for coffee and croissant as rest of breakfast was rather sparse and somewhat disgusting bar was functional but not comfy hotel designed for people with kids ,0
 very modern clean hood facilitiesgood value,1
 paying this price for this room smelled bad looked bad overall bad room,0
 compact room but had all the facilities comfortable night,1
 room very little breakfast not included in a rate for a 4 start hotel very high noisy room shower in bath tube without courtain or glass to protect from water spreading breakfast room even more little that the room lobby in a corridor cannot be a 4 star hotel definitely does not worth the price ,0
 two single beds put together as a double with single quilts room was dirty,0
 big pillows and breakfast,1
 rude reception desk at check in didn t acknowledge my existence or make eye contact once checkout female was pleasant and efficient room was 16degrees and didn t hear up beyond 18 all night room service was cold pizza and tasted awful bath towels like hand towels face missing from taps dirty grout around bath other than that it was great not ,0
 hotel location is excellent hotel exterior and public spaces are very impressive,1
 beautiful hotel in very central location close to the best and most expensive shops in paris beautiful wood panelled room with blue marble bathroom ,1
 good size rooms and loved the walk in shower,1
 staff were very welcomring,1
 the hotel s architecture and history the decoration and lucky george the staff is attentive and friendly and the location is excellent we will be back ,1
 the hotel is rich in history and in great location for transportation food and entertainment the staff was very helpful the room itself was large for london and had ac but the bathroom was tiny and claustrophobic we were told all other floors had larger ones we would definitely stay there again but not in that room laundry was available just a 5 minute walk away ,1
 everything worse experience ever,0
 just round the corner from the tube station,1
 the rooms were excellent and the staff were very helpful ,1
 really bad facilities bathroom cleaning elevator noise isolation breakfast area everything is old tired water taps are so bad that you need a strong male hand to open close it cleaning unwashed glass non replaced sheet even no don t bother to put on the door elevator for 2 people without bags and to 3rd floor only then coil stairs to 4th floor breakfast area is so small and tight that you even think if you want to go to breakfast flapping doors locks,0
 the beds were comfy,1
 beds beautifully comfy,1
 i have been a regular client here for several years and have written 2 very favourable reviews previously on this site my stay on oct 3rd was to be the third in 5 weeks contributing 675 to their income in that period however instead of receiving a warm welcome as a loyal customer i was met with a demand for photographic id this requirement had been introduced by the new owners i was told after some heated discussion i requested to see the manager but he refused to leave his office a more placatory receptionist came on duty and remembered me from previous visits but still insisted on id even though the room had already been paid for so if you enjoy being treated disagreeably and with disdain then this is the place for you if not try one of the other 2 500 london hotels ,0
 the staff did not read the notes i made during booking where i had to pay more charges to have comfortable stay in addition the rooms are overused and do not deserve the money paid last why we have to pay for the wifi in the room while nowadays its free in streets ,0
 room beds breakfast staff all wonderful close to st pancras station eurostar to paris belgium easily accessible great restaurants in the area pool great experience ,1
 unfriendly staff who are not interested in resolving any problems that they have caused too expensive ,0
 wifi very poor and no signal in hotel via service provider booked a superior king room but i have no idea what was superior about it hotel is overpriced and on the wrong side of the river for o2 but is advertised as close by no night room service and is in the middle of a residential site but no shops definitely wouldn t stay again,0
 all hotel staff excellent nothing was too much for them a little expensive but worth it we will come again fantastic old building ,1
 no air conditioning mold phone was left in the room and missing when we returned never to be found don t know why this hotel had such high reviews on booking com,0
 rooms were too small,0
 location and design,1
 paper cups in a 4star hotel is a little cheap 1 english speaking chanel on the tv half of the lights in the room didn t work the door to the room required the strength of charles atlas to close it and charging guests 5 to place 2 proper cups in the room was a taste of things to come just to put the cherry on the cake the pool was not available and only disclosed once the payment was taken bring a chest of money if you wish to use the spa facilities ,0
 lovely period building i great location next to hyde park ,1
 unfortunately the hotel were very inflexible my friends mother had to have an emergency operation which effected our plans due to childcare this preventing our stay the hotel refused to move the date of our booking or waver the cancellation fee it was bank holiday sunday and all rooms were fully booked i am more than certain this room could have been resold very disappointing ,0
 check in process disastrous and stressful for many incompetent staff safety and security of guests compromised with poor policies don t lose your keys or there is a good chance your stuff will be stolen safety lock on door was also broken general management wouldn t even respond when concerns sent to them in writing never been treated so poorly ,0
 bad wifi connection air conditioning didn t work dust because of renovation and construction everywhere and noisy the should have reimburse the costs and or warning because of the situation,0
 for a 4 star hotel there was no tea coffee making service provided in room nor did the hotel make arrangements for any ,0
 toiletries for 2 adults a bit mean eg one small shower gel between 2 mix up at breakfast as prepaid but not logged on check in then questioned when came to be seated embarrassing room a little cold,0
 the hotel was lovely as we re the staff,1
 great location and luxurious accommodations ,1
 bed very comfy staff very friendly,1
 location was great,1
 staff were rude,0
 the staff were really helpfull the room was excellent and the breakfast was great the hotel location is ideal for the tube and car parking is good what more could you ask for,1

 room was small but i didn t mind ,0
 smallest room ever no bar in hotel,0
 all of it in spite of refreshing the facade they need to change the atadd,0
 bedroom and bathroom very unclean wi fi virtually useless very average breakfast buffet,0
 breakfast was typical for france staff don t speak english breakfast clean underground is 100m ,1
 the bedroom was in the basement no light and ridiculously small to make matters worse the bed was super uncomfortable and made a lot of noise we checked in at 1 am then left by 5 am ,0
 i liked everything ,1
 very helpful and friendly staff the lady who booked my wife and i in and out was very professional and friendly and made my wife s birthday a very memorable one the bar staff had to put up with a rude resident which i felt was totally unjustified but she was polite at all times when she probably would ve been with in her rights to reply in the same manner but she didn t so well done to her i wish i had names but both served me in reception and the other in the bar plz trace them and thank them on our behalf julian lloyd room 9025 stayed on 23rd jan thanks again,1
 unclean toilet and bathroom cracked floors and the wood on the floor was breaking off bed was awful broke my back channel selection was poor ,0

 room is marvelous the people and breakfast are very ncie ,1
 cleanliness location breakfast staff quietness,1
 the bathroom was very very small i emailed after my stay with a concern regarding the stay and did not get a reply as i had already paid for the room etc a few small issues with the room i e lamp not working items left over from previous guests breakfast an expensive extra not included,0
 hotel location has great access to tube lines and the british museum is an easy five minute walk cafe nero is kitty corner for delicious coffee makes for an inexpensive continental breakfast hotel bar is a quiet comfortable spot for a pre post dinner cocktail and be sure to rub the brass dragon located on the second floor in the stair well it s mate is at the bottom of the atlantic aboard the titanic ,1
 great ambiance with exceptional art details our view of the place du sorbonne was amazing ,1
 rooms need to updated urgently tatty cold cramped very noisy at night double glazing needed on windows someone try to enter our room in the early hours it was only the security chain that stop them coming in very scary we won t be staying at the hotel ,0
 firstly it s located in a bad place just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population it feels dangerous to go alone in the streets facilities were ok as it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant but this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant they claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi rooms weren t cleaned properly someone s inner were lying inside my room toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane ,0
 no wifi signal in the room room too small no window only ventilator suffocating,0
 first day was disaster lifts were not working i was on 22nd floor had to do the stairs twice from 10th floor no staff to assist us thru when i asked for compensation they said we really apologize for the inconvenience caused breakfast was confused with a group from india and i had to eat what i never ate in life second day was same but luckily i asked a waitress when the group is leaving so she mentioned are u not with them oh so sorry sir then u should have your breakfast in other area this place had better breakfast thank god but it happened because i asked a question the hotel staff never bothered to confirm if we r part of the group ,0
 unable to run bath took 45 mins staff responded within 10 mins but problem not fixed and the promise of a room change never happened room very very small mini bar had selection of drink but only one beer hotel bar hard to find very small so couldn t get in it sat night draughty windows and shabby curtains ,0
 i towels were so grey i would not have even dried a cat with them ,0
 extremely musty throughout with evidence of mould in my room in serious need of renovation ,0
 you have to go down to get the ironing board and they will tell you to wait as there are no people in the reception after waiting for so long thinking that they will send the iron to your room end up you have to get it yourself from the recep the kettle was not working and when u told them this they replaced with another spoiled kettle whats more this guy of indian descent even argue that he replaced it with new one but he did not check whether its working duh and for storage luggage they wont help you the lady just pointed to us where to store our luggages the door knob in the toilet was spoilt and the bath tub is just for display no water stopper despite the fact that we already feedback with them and they promised that they will do something about it they could lie to the customers just like that and the toilet separate from the shower smells like urine we could not take it so i mop it myself stayed here 3 nights as we have kids and its difficult to transfer hotel anymore but will definitely not coming back and to booking com i honestly having doubts now if the review you posted on your website are authentic ,0
 disgusting smell in the room noisy air conditioner small room bad service attitude i will never live in there anymore ,0
 very professional and friendly staff beautiful facility could not have been happier ,1
 receptionist was not happy not particularly helpful hot water ran out after 2 showers with 3 people in the room bar not busy table service would be so much better,0
 the bed was comfortable the concierge was pleasant and very helpful l ,1
 i m wondering how this hotel is rated 4 stars rooms are very small very average breakfast i paid the full stay in cash they removed the first night and after 17 days i still didn t get my money back every time i ask them they said that they contacted their bank and refund will come soon be sure to get a room with ceiling fan and ac because when the ac stop working they say that ac is not included in the booking not very close to any underground station,0
 i had a group of business clients and their rooms were not ready although we booked the night before already so that they could be able to check in very early it was communicated to the hotel as well as the correct dates and they confirmed it by email all in order but nothing was as per the email no changes made and were advise of no shows even after the email confirmation that all is in order the clients were not happy and they were all vip s i looked bad at the end of the day will not use the hotel ever again unless i have no choice,0
 whole experience added to our fantastic adventure,1
 the a c didn t work and the shower head didn t work it was too hot on the room and we got four free drinks as an excuse because they could not give as another room when we tried to use the drink cards we got the bartender said the cards is not allowed ,0
 the noise of racing cars on sloane street all night was outrageous also a huge drill in the road started early on sunday morning staff knew and said i should have changed room during the night i say they shouldn t have given me a room where they knew there was such a problem no attempt was made to re minutes or recompense they just said sorry and that there was nothing they could do ,0
 stuff uninterested furniture in the rooms old and smelly shower heads can t move so it was really weird to take showers hotel needs improvement in general ,0
 booking com,0
 the flowers for my wife,1
 room size was very small furniture was very old,0
 the non smoking room horrendously smelled like an ash tray staff unwilling to change rooms or make alternative accommodations aerosol air freshener was unhelpful i ve travelled the world and stayed at all types of hotels b b s inns and resorts my only recommendation as a well seasoned traveller is to stay anywhere but here ,0
 tremendous customer service gorgeous interiors and excellent location ,1
 perfect location quiet helpful and friendly staff,1
 efficient helpful staff marvellous beds the most comfortable we have ever stayed in,1
 i have been in many 4 stars hotels but this hotel is not even 2 star compared to the other 4 stars hotels that i staid before the room was too small and it is not like the photos they are showing plus the hotel in general is not really clean and the area where the hotel located is not clean at all so basically it is not suitable for families i have a lot to say about what i did not like but the space here will not be enough ,0
 safe in our room didn t work wifi did not work in our room no robes and slippers provided as advertised a fairly typical small overpriced london hotel room really nothing remarkable quite disappointed as a lot of the reviews seemed to rave about it ,0
 the breakfast was late and when it got there i don t think my dog would have eaten it it was cold not a lot on the plate so we didn t eat it but still had to pay,0
 very disappointed with the receptionist as she didn t honor and acknowledge the booking that were properly booked with notes and request very upset that i need to double my payment on my first day as they did not honor our prior bookings and we lost money on the first day because we have to pay for another night horrible experience never never again to this hotel as a traveler entrepreneur pr and former news anchor i will never ever recommend this hotel very upset disappointed and stressed i came from a very faraway country just to experience this kind of customer service ,0
 quiet location from the crowds,1
 the location is great the staff is really friendly ,1
 friendly helpful staff clean comfortable room and facilities great with children ,1
 comfortable bed ,1
 the bed might as well sleep on the floor things that promised in web site did not work such as shower speaker and docking station,0
 great room seriously comfortable bed friendly staff ,1
 staff were lovely very polite helpful and efficient ,1
 noise noise and noise once again we got a quiet room facing some dumpster better than facing the street and i mean it but extremely thin walls made us hear everything i mean absolutely everything couple upstairs having romantic moments or using toilet neighbours moving their luggage neighbours talking to each other people walking on corridors also there was some shouting in the middle of the night included in the package deal that woke us up 2 nights out of 3 people were shouting from floor below us and we could hear them very well very poor facilities no bar no really waiting area no nothing staff they were not bad they just did not care we had the fastest check in out in the world and i do not mean it in a positive way we got zero information about hotel facilities if there are any breakfast etc we just got a room key and wifi password another thing is how the receptionist lady checked if our room is ready she basically started yelling like crazy to somebody upstairs and after several shouts she got confirmation that the room is ready yay our room was cleaned although we left card saying we do not wish it to be cleaned,0
 the first room we were given was on the 5th floor awful room tiny and claustrophobic thankfully we asked to change and were given a nice room on the 2nd floor no comparison but there was a big gap under the door and unfortunately the lift was right outside the door we heard ever sound and conversation from outside the room including the guest in the room next door mediatating at 6am also every cleaning store cupboard was open when we passed through the hotel look awful and unsightly the concierge bar staff hadn t a clue i asked for a coke one evening and i was given the bottle no glass no ice another evening i asked for a brandy and the barman had no idea what i was asking for or how to serve it my husband also asked for a brandy but there was none left i got the last brandy ,0
 love the lobby bar staff helpful location brilliant ,1
 very noisy at night the hotel has a restaurant that stays open and play loud music until 2am making impossible to rest we had to exchange room at 2am elevators were broken at check in and check out 5 floors up and down no ac only heater no kingsize bed it was 2 single beds united not comfortable shower design is terrible it s very small and open and the bathroom floor is always soaked due this poorly layout hotel was in maintenance in the morning again making impossible to rest due noise horrible experience would not recommend it ,0
 excellent service would definitely recommend to anyone ,1
 perfect location,1
 staff always fantastic and helpful wonderful receptionists we had a problem with roadworks noise and reception did everything they could to make us happy immediately offered room switch it was late in evening and we were too tired to pack everything up the hotel gave us complimentary breakfast next morning very attentive and friendly staff modern beautifully decorated great lighting macs and printers available in reception area handy for printing out flight tickets etc we love staying at this hotel and it s always our go to tube is 4 minute walk to hammersmith and buses into the city centre are opposite hotel plenty of restaurants shops just 4 mins away ,1
 such a luxurious hotel with comfortable and stylish rooms that has it all the staff are amazing making you feel very special i really enjoyed my experience there again as it was my second time fantastic location too as it s next to hyde park and one street away from loads of eateries and superstores all huddled together in one place ,1
 walls very thin you could hear next dor coughing and using the toilet air conditioning didn t work noisy at night,0
 pillows were too soft without an option in the room lifts were a bit of a problem on our final day,0
 sound isolation was very poor every time someone passed through the corridors you could hear it you could even hear what they are talking about furthermore i have been lucky with some neighbors who decided that it is a good idea to shout at each other at 2 a m add to that the wonderful sound isolation of the rooms and you have got an unforgettable night in paris p s no real windows were present either i mean there was one looking into a square inner yard 1 5x1 5m and you could easily look into the neighboring rooms ,0
 friendly and very helpful reception and concierge staff ,1
 to have internet 2e hour otherwise very poor and stop every 5mn impossible to stop in car to take off the luggage we have to find a public parking not too far and come back to carrying our luggage laundry loose some clothe,0
 although the hotel conveniently located it s rooms are small both bath and shower are one thing table space for work is not sufficient for a business traveller staff not friendly i will not be returning to the hotel ,0
 the beds were really comfortable and clean the size of rooms for london were what could be expected advantage close to edgeware rd and central to rail and busses ,1
 staff were rude room was too hot and small,0
 the bar staff,1
 small dark rooms which were very noisey ,0
 the room was extremely small even though i paid a great amount for my stay very disappointed ,0
 no so good price for the hotel high and lift not work,0
 location cleanliness friendly staff a nice quiet hotel ,1
 everything ,1
 i didnot like the way how they treat me in the reception i booked a junior suite but they put me in a normal room and when i asked them the reception try to explain to me the room is equal to junior suite so why u charged me for a junior suite and they give me normal room best regards,0
 i was asked to pay extra for my booking the duty manager was not friendly at all breakfast was bad and it was not arranged up to standard ,0
 room had bits hanging off it staff obviously gave another person a key to our room in error so had an early morning visitor seriously understaffed when checking in a poor trainee was trying to cope really creaky corridors and just a bit grubby noisy cleaners have stayed here before but it seems to have deteriorated in a few short months ,0
 location hotel intererior styling is amazing and nice surroundings ,1
 the room was really spacious and light and the bed super comfy the rubber duck in the bathroom was a bonus and loved having sky movies ,1
 hotel is modern and clean we were in refurbished room on the 8th floor with new shower room and fresh decor hotel is 10 15 minutes walk from kings cross and not far from british museum ,1
 no proper light over bathroom mirror bathroom open to room nightclub feel to corridors floor in foyer worn and didn t appear clean breakfast was set up there and with the black decor was not very inviting we took our breakfast out into the courtyard the breakfast buffet was okay but the cheese was in a container which had previously been used for a fish buffet a whiff of old seafood at breakfast the corridors walls were covered with a black fake fur ,0
 the staff is great the location is perfect ,1
 wonderful welcome from michaela who was excellent very friendly and helpful also upgraded us breakfast was also excellent with great selection and service highly recommend to all ,1
 friendly staff always ready to help ,1
 i had food poisoning i m very upset because i booked this hotel to celebrate valentine s with my fianc because i was away so i couldn t do in the actual day my poor fianc had to look after me day and night i was sick and a person next door was loud at 3am in the morning no rest my weekend was ruin ,0
 great breakfast with superb service ,1
 very convenient location to transfer and restaurants and even the rooms are on ground floor it is on a quiet street and we are able to a good night rest ,1
 location pool leisure facilities and the massage that my wife received all excellent,1
 location a bit too far out which we didn t really understand when booking our fault bit would have hoped for a nearer tube stop the bed and pillows were really uncomfortable and we had a bad nights sleep the queue for the check in was also really long longer than we have ever seen at a hotel at check in time the staff were also quite aloof and unfriendly compared to other hotels we have stayed in ,0
 rooms are tiny barely enough space to set your suitcase down noisy rooms are so close to each other ,0
 room was shocking lamp broken to doesn t work heating didn t work no blankets to try to get it fixed you have to ask more than once need i go on ,0
 perfect location a few walking minutes away from london eye super friendly and competent staff amazing massage good food definitely worth a stay ,1
 they did not return the deposits they took from my credit card i m still trying stay away ,0
 no hot water well constantly switching from hot to cold bed was rock solid staff were nothing but rude never staying here again ,0
 we always stay at this hotel great location to visit our son,1
 the worst hotel i have ever booked very slow and weak wifi signal very poor room service and on top if that small rooms ,0
 front desk friendly and very helpful location excellent,1
 stunning clean and classy bedroom breakfast buffet was fantastic beautiful lobby s greeted by very friendly staff can t wait to come back the o2 was a stone throw away and north greenwich tube station is 3 minutes down the road ,1
 the decor is very tired wallpaper curling away from the walls at the corners very faded carpets across the hotel multiple chips and blemishes in the bathroom windows in the bar area have possibly never been cleaned it looks like it would have been a beautiful hotel when it was last refurbished but that very likely wasn t this century the room was very noisy from approx 6am until 1am due to the dlr and the fact a window in the room was broken open and i wear hearing aids so may be intolerable for a normal hearing person the plumbing was dangerous due to the temperature of the shower consistently veering from stone cold to scalding hot causing my partner to get burnt i found the beds to be very firm which isn t to my liking but may be to your liking reception staff weren t interested in my attempts to point out the broken items in the room and the duty manager fobbed me off by saying to just email them instead it was very difficult to get my booking amended and resulted in over 45mins on the phone using a premium priced phone line being passed back and forth between departments,0
 staff were friendly and professional location was great for central london soho was 15 mins walk there was a multi storey car park just on the next street which was quite cheap loved the stay here found a cafe just down the road which did a lovely full english for 5 95 ,1
 lovely breakfast and helpful staff,1
 the staff very helpful and always polite at all times the manager in the bar was very good and helpful,1
 lovely big beds fantastic choice at breakfast,1
 after booking 2 rooms the general manager informed my colleague and i we would need to share 1 room in the end we were forced to move hotels ,0
 a really good location close to hyde park and central london staff were polite attentive extremely friendly and helpful we will definitely stay here again when visiting london good value ,1
 very modern room with queen sized bed and minimalist furnishings very comfortable and stylish ,1
 architecture and history of the place in particular the stairs foyer restaurant and bar ,1
 smelly toilet food poisoned my colleague attitude of staff in resteraunt state of bathroom just not nice and 107 on a sunday means basic standards at least are required and beefburgers if served need to be cooked properly not cold and not poisonous ,0
 the room did not have what was stated for a deluxe room no mini bar safe broken no bathrobes no hairdryer shower head dirty window latch broken so held with a magazine receptionist stated the robes was on request staff had to send a hairdryer up to the room assistant manager listened to all the complaints offered us 10 discount off our next stay no discount could be offered off our stay 525 for 2 nights this service will make me think twice before booking again room 611 ,0
 great customer service really enjoyed our stay would certainly recommend ,1
 rooms very old ripped wall paper shower not working properly rooms not cleaned over priced more like 65 per night not a 170 per night hotel,0
 the property was very nice staff very helpfull the room was very nice and comfortable ,1
 the last time i stayed it was a disappointing room and the breakfast used small plates now back to the normal standards,1
 the hotel is amazing beautiful old building and the rooms are very modern ,1
 internet,0
 i didn t like my room because it was cold and the bed was too small for a double when i requested for room move they put me in a twin disable room when i clearly booked a double when i requested for another room move they said they were gonna ring me back which they never did so i had to go back downstairs to speak to someone they were rude and put me back to the same room i said i didn t like ,0
 you charge for every thing and the staff workers lied to us,0
 high price with hardly working facilities wifi in rooms used to be free before and it is now charged separately for business traveler wifi is a must in room and not in lobby even in lobby it keeps getting disconnected every 20 mins crazy wifi facility health club is required for business users to relax the stressed out day that is also separately charged ,0
 toilet not clean on arrival no shower curtain shower fixture loose bad smell in room ,0
 woth a name like hilton i expect first class service this is bigger at best ,0
 location,1
 my cabine room was not according to the standards of a 4 stars hotel only 2 miserable coat hangers no wardrobe dirty curtains miserable lighting the staff is not very professional all young people with good will but little experience ,0
 upgraded to studio suite we initially booked for the standard room and the receptionist was so kind and told us that she will upgrade our stay to studio suite the hotel s interior is superb with warm welcome the security guard and receptionists the room itself is very spacious and bed is comfortable there is a large living room that can be arranged into sofa bed sleep for two people we didn t use it since there was just the two of us and the bathroom is complete with shower and bathtub ,1
 rooms very dingy and old fashioned breakfast average staff miserable very unhelpful in reception and don t know the basics of the area would not stay again as in modern day hotels it is not up to general standards beds hard as rocks,0
 all the furniture broken and some light not working its bad room and therese bad smell in room,0
 quiet and clean friendly staff,1
 good clean room which reflects what was promised on the photos take note not all rooms have the old grand baths ,1
 we loved the hotel and would like to return later in the year,1
 the manager was one of the rudest people i have ever come across ,0
 location is very good charming neighborhood and square in front of the hotel,1
 it was freezing cold temp in my room was 18degrees which i could see on the aircon panel it was impossible to heat up the room after hours of sitting in sweaters in bed with aircon set up to max heating it was 19 5 degrees this is unacceptable i complained and was promised a heater but noone brought it to my room my colleagues had another room and it was the same i also got mail that i can t get breakfast and can pay 10eur for cereal and order it to my room what a pleasure to sit in this freezing room and eat cold breakfast i definitely do not recommend to anyone ,0
 staff were extremely friendly and helpful breakfast had plenty of choice including vegetarian ,1
 nice room with everything i needed and more i like the microwave which was a nice touch for the suite rooms,1
 nice view of london eye from bedroom walk distance to london eye county hall and the big ben convenient transportation route nearby ,1
 i found a dead gnat in my food ,0
 close to tram excellent room nice staff ,1
 the bed is comfurtable room is quite large compared to other hotels location is amazing between paddington hyde park and queensway,1
 we got a room after renovation and the bathroom and especially the toilet seat were dirty although we said it to the staff it was not cleaned until we got back to the room after dinner since it was late and we were tired from a long flight we cleaned it by ourselves the next days the lady at the reception was very empathic about our bad experience but her manager strangely could never find the time to talk to us about it they offered free breakfast as compensation but we had other plans for breakfast so it wasn t a possibility for us they didn t find anything else and just left it at that until we checked out after we returned home the manager found the time to contact us by mail and again offered something that was not relevant for us she just didn t bother answering us after we said it wasn t relevant we suggested to take the first night off the price since we checked in very late and all we did in the room was to clean it and sleep but she didn t even bother considering it the wifi was very slow the room is very small ,0
 great location with easy access to queensway and bayswater tube stations and about 15 minutes walk from paddington station airport express good eateries in westbourne grove and good chinese eateries in queensway edwardian dark oak panelling through public rooms is impressive ,1
 the location was brilliant was comfortable and clean staff very helpful when i was having trouble booking a hire car ,1
 they are not reliable at all ,0
 the staff was friendly and very helpfull,1
 this was billed as a luxury property which was why we booked it for our birthday trip however it is all looks and no substance price lists were to be found in bathroom by kettle etc and very little was included in the expensive price for the rooms whoever thought the metal cups were a good look obviously didn t try to make a hot drink and then burn their hand on the metal handle no spoons just silly wooden stirrers bin and sheets only changed every three days for a luxury hotel it offered little more than a premier inn at a fraction of the price very disappointed not what we wanted for a special occasion ,0
 location staff optional facilities i didn t use any of these check in and out was easy ,1
 very plain hotel missing quality in all directions ,0
 for us the most important aspect of this hotel was its location how come it has taken so long for someone to think about building a hotel next to the o2 in addition the hotel was excellent the service fantastic and breakfast amazing we have stayed at hotels that purport to be 5 but this one really was 5 ,1
 lovely location comfortable room we had a club room which was okay in size the smaller rooms would have been very compact ,1
 food hotel staff all excellent,1
 the chief concierge farooq was extremely helpful with all our luggages it was of walking distance to the champs elysees and generally not difficult to find for taxi drivers the cafe across the road was also pleasant and does good cheeseburgers ,1
 modern and well appointed nice shower bathrobes slippers in room ironing board and adapters if you forget one ,1
 the room was neat and compact,1
 faculties and room were stunning breakfast delicious location great for o2,1
 the room had everything we needed and was very clean and quiet ,1
 the helpful staff nothing was too much trouble ,1
 great view from room,1
 staff was not friendly it took over an hour and two phone calls to front desk for a remote to television because there wasn t one in the room i asked for a taxi and one was supposedly called but never arrived when booking i requested a late checkout but on departure date no one knew what i was talking about despite an email confirming the request luckily the one woman on staff on october 16th at 1600 had sense to honor the request to allow me to retrieve my luggage from room ,0
 this is the second time we have stayed here and consider its location excellent it is on the edge of bercy village and just a couple of hundred metres away from a metro stop making it easy to get around on this occasion we had travelled out to watch france v england at le stade we were upgraded on arrival from superior to deluxe which was obviously appreciated although i m not certain how the rooms differed other than the free soft drinks mini bar the room was light spacious and spotlessly clean and the large bed afforded us two extremely comfortable nights sleep we managed to secure a deal with breakfast included which obviously made it better value choices available are extensive so i defy anyone to not find something that appeals ,1
 the location rooms staff and breakfast all made for a very enjoyable stay ,1
 the hotel was comfortable and very close to restaurants and train station could not fault this hotel ,1
 perfect location a clean room and bathroom super fast wifi and friendly helpful staff ,1
 inside the hotel is shabby dirty and old there was a cockroach in the italian restaurant which the staff laughed about and there was a mouse in the bar later that evening terrible never seen such things in a london 3 4star hotel ,0
 the staffs is very lazy rude and bad bad experience for my paris trip ,0
 rooms too small no air con hzd to move rooms staff vefy abrupt ,0
 booked into wrong room no balcony then waited over 2 hours for food as our order wasn t processed ,0
 the staff were friendly and helpful the room very quiet with adequate facilities ,1
 same,0
 very friendly and helpful staff,1
 everything,0
 the position close to the tube and all the places i had to visit for my business trip ,1
 excellent service and comfy rooms brilliant views of london,1
 wordings of minutes from tube station was deceiving lodge was located much further took a half hour walk each way few buses run through the area hence was really inconvenient pricey for that location and facilities early check in was promised when requested on bookin com but asked to pay extra when we arrived very dishonest we felt so was overall an unpleasant experience ,0
 when i booked they gave me a room which you could hardly rate it 2 star smell of tobacco had remained in curtains and carpet they gave me worse room just because i had not book directly through hotel when i asked to change the room they did but again very uncomfirtsble bed and noisy was close to lift and neighbors were slamming the door all the time i did not sleep at all i am not a rich man from gulf countries who carries lots of 50 notes with me i work so hard to get a treat like that the reason i booked the hotel was to have a good rest as i had a appointment in the nearby hospital the mini bar was left emty so no water at night to drink ,0
 on may 11 8 30am i called to borrow a hairdryer since the one in the room was not working i also asked if i could borrow an iron the lady staff in the front desk told me that they were too busy to bring those items to our room so i must get them downstairs i did because as i said the hairdryer in the room was not working in the lobby beside the front desk the bespactled front desk lady staff gave me the huge ironing board the iron and the hair drier which i carried myself and brought to our room located at the end of the hallway how we treat our guests is a very important part of our overall experience guests stay in a hotel with a mindset that their needs will be catered to and also expect that people tending to them will exude a certain level of joy in serving you we are paying for our stay and for their services and that was the first impression i got i have stayed in so many hotels around the world and it was my first time to be treated this way the sink in our bathroom was draining so slow almost clogged but i did not bother to raise my concern because of how cold the staff treated me on our first day of stay i will never recommend this hotel to anyone and i will never book with them ever it was the worst hotel experience i got ,0
 everything the room was full of flies when i got inside there was no air conditioning and since the place was hot they left the window open all very well then buy a flies screen my room was close to the elevator and the wall made a lot of noise when the elevator was functioning waking me up constantly during the night the carpet was dusty and the bathroom was in desperate need of redoing they should not call it hotel and not charge more than 50 pounds per night i believe even hostels would be more glamorous than this ,0
 the size of the room for a double deluxe far to small bath had chips n rust shower went everywhere in the bathroom due to hardly any shower protection the staff who booked us in very unfriendly no smile or helpfulness ,0
 breakfasts were bland bedroom was cleaned each day but bottles and glasses were not removed over our three days television did not work had to report each morning and evening cash machine out of order ,0
 we had a basement room which seemed a bit strange at first but it was so quiet and that allowed us to rest ,1
 the staff were unhelpful and not very friendly we are not from around the area so asked for help regarding travel to wembley and were only told about getting a taxi no other options told so we had to seek the information ourselves i was very angry that someone complained about having to pay for parking and so they were given it free of charge when i had to pay surely this is not fair i also was not happy that when we arrived late on in the evening the man who served us at reception said to a colleague something about not having a room which made me worry after a short while we were given a room which was clearly for a disabled customer as there was no bath the sink was very low down so hard to use i felt as though we were just shoved in a room and been forgotten about also despite putting the sign on our door to not disturb us we were woken up at 10 00am by the cleaner walking straight in overall we were not impressed and would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone i am very disappointed and would appreciate an email regarding the issues raised please ,0
 firstly we had to wait a very long time to get checked in the staff member at the reception then booked us in the wrong room once that was sorted out we got to our room and then notice that the floor was dirty it was full of crumbs by the bed the following day when we checked out an hour late as we overslept which was 10 extra however the same lady at the recpetion tried to charge us 20 extra for a late check out every thing about this hotel was rubbish i would highly suggest you to not stay here ,0
 excellent location for the apollo friendly staff ,1
 perfect location great staff,1
 breakfast was amazing and so was the shower ,1
 location cordial staff,1
 what looked like blood on net curtains poorly decorated shabby broken air con,0
 great location nice and clean room friendly staff,1
 even on the discount rate and for london i think it was v poor value for money the tiniest of rooms for the money it was smaller than a hong kong room i wouldn t recommend for business ,0
 very professional service well groomed and helpful ,1
 my first room was on the 4th floor over the street and the traffic noise was unbearable ambulances with wailing sirens were frequently arriving at the hospital around the corner the second room was quiet but tiny and bug infested ,0
 the hotel interior is luxurious bright airy and modern the rooms are larger than average with super king beds which are extremely comfortable the staff are attentive and there is a good variety of restaurants bars the hotel parking is good value for money and if you are going to a concert at the 02 then you will love the private walkway in the hotel right adjoined to the 02 arena ,1
 nothing ,0
 no kettle in room room is too small for two people and only one chair window does not open too hot in room coffee 5 floors down is not very good too noisy music in reception why not coffee drinks facility on same floor as room ,0
 booked for deluxe room but they give me combat room reception staff rude i moved to club room and paid for additional charge but i was surprice the bed was twin and they just put next to each other very disappointed,0
 hotel is quite dated and in need of some attention ,0
 assistance from staff was excellent when required hotel room was light and airy and the pool facilities were excellent slept very well indeed ,1
 no tea coffee facilities outside of your room ,0
 dirty bedshits on arrival personal not very proffesional and responsive,0
 a great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building we had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows bed was amazingly comfortable walking distance to paddngton station and heathrow express ,1
 the rooms and furniture are very old the bed is very uncomfortable definitely needs refurbishment not at all worth the price i paid ,0
 good standard of newly refurbished rooms and a good value for money in central london ,1
 firstly the room was far too expensive for what we got it was the worst room i ve ever stayed in after paying over 100 the room serious is worth 40 disgusting it was the noise from the main rd meant we slept really bad windows need double glazing the shower room was nice but the rest was awful i won t be staying there again full stop,0
 good location and very friendly staff,1
 the hotel is currently undergoing renovation having said that we paid for breakfast and although we knew at the time of booking that it was a continental breakfast we didn t mind what we had was a stale croissant the tiniest muffin i have ever seen a hard boiled egg that wasn t freshly prepared an apple and a carton of orange juice how best weston had the nerve to charge for this i ll never know i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i most certainly won t be staying there again,0
 the bedroom was spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable we were amazed how quiet the hotel was we didn t hear a sound the staff were very polite and helpful ,1
 lovely hotel wrong room to begin with courtney sorted very efficiently with an upgrade ,1
 the dirty sock on the floor when i arrived the size of the bed which was tiny for tow people the thin duffet in december which meant i was up all night freezing,0
 room was absolutely tiny despite been told we had been upgraded to a club room the toilet was far too small especially the actual size of the shower the service in the bar and restaurant was beyond slow and food was bad ,0
 bed extra comfy,1
 very old hotel and small rooms although i stayed in an executive room no mini fridge and no air conditioning but a small converter for heating keeping in mind that i am a world traveler due to the nature of my job this hotel was by far the worst hotel i have stayed ,0
 staff i was given a double room with no balcony without being told anything i went to reception told them this is not the room i paid for i paid for a queen with balcony and views and was told sorry we are extremely busy tonight we only have that room i said that s unexceptable they told me do you love on london we can redund you money and come and stay with us another night when i was 3 in morning had to organise a babysitter ect also underground car park was full,0
 location is nice and surrounding is also pretty comfortable to find aynthing,1
 they don t reduce de price and seriously i want my money back worst hotel and politic for booking ever see ,0
 hotel room view of garden breakfast buffet selection being asked if we require anymore breakfast items before they finish,1
 staff were rude no mobile phone chargers could be produced ,0
 location,0
 our airconditioning was not working therefore we changed rooms that day unfortunately the airconditioner was not working in the room we moved to either we asked for someone to come up to check the airconditioner and acted as if we were crazy luckily the next morning i spoke with someone at the front desk and he had assured it was fixed by the time we got back there were also ants crawling on the floor and a very big bug ran behind our beds just before we went to bed ,0
 everything was splendid,1
 no air condition,0
 bedding smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and sweat covers were clean but quilts had very bad odour ,0
 it was dirty the smell was horrific ,0
 simply a terrible experience and a waste of a lot of money management should be ashamed as they were unavailable to sort out problems no wonder they were in hiding hope they go to the wall ,0
 the stuff behavior was a bit bad and the room service was not that good ,0
 very good breakfast,1
 i was really impressed with my room it was light and airy i felt welcomed at all times i loved being able to curl up in the bar with a book i felt very comfortable and safe as a sinlge woman ,1
 it s a really lovely hotel modern clean and really helpful friendly staff a great location as it s just a couple of minutes walk from the metro and the bercy village boutique shops and good value restaurants with outside dining a little bit of heaven reprieve from the hustle and bustle of gorgeous paris ,1
 tiny room no air con and shower was very small tiny bed and location was in a dirty area,0
 excellent location 20 mins from st pancras lovely clean and comfortable rooms a great choice for breakfast hot or cold staff lovely kind and helpful a brilliant last minute find and we will be coming back here again and again special thanks to ankur for looking after us ,1
 pictures did not match room room was too small to be nice room was not professionally clean,0
 amazing food with amazing staff location was very good ,1
 the hotel sells it self as air conditioned i discovered on one of london s hottest weeks of the summer that the air conditioning had broken down 2 days earlier and they were waiting it to be fixed put up with a room with no airconditioned the bedroom temperature reached 40 c plus a disgrace of a hotel,0
 the tv was too small for the price bed was uncomfortable and the room absolutely stank of cleaning materials half of the electricals in the room did not function properly overall a waste of money and i can say with satisfaction never again ,0
 a mouse in our room had to move to another room at 2 15am after complaint to manager not a nice start to holiday,0
 i really think this is the most cozy hotel i have ever stay for paris ,1
 very small room not very clean,0
 on arrival noticed one of the towels was quite dirty in the bathroom crockery was left unwashed in the room and wastepaper bins were not emptied after housekeeping had been pillows very hard very little in the way of tea making facilities only 2 teabags i thought the staff were quite cold and not very welcoming ,0
 bed was too high staff attitude very condescending,0
 bad room bad bathroom bad clean bad breakfast ,0
 when i got there the telly was broken and it took 30 mins to get another one i was out the whole of saturday came back and my room had not been cleaned and i left the sign on the door to clean room also when i woke up there was a bug in the room due to the fact it wasn t cleaned the night before,0
 location staff s politeness and friendliness only really slept there but perfect for us ,1
 what we paid for we didn t get the rooms where terrible i feel you didn t deliver what we agreed with in our booking with you ,0
 small room no privacy you can hear whatever happens in the next room 0 customer service ,0
 great location great staff great hotel ,1
 the rooms were not at all what was shown in the pictures they were extremely small i booked six months in advance and i was placed in the basement there was no air conditioning and since i was in the basement ground window we couldn t open the windows for air there was a humidifier in the room that didn t work properly and was not vented out of the room properly when asked to switch rooms i was told that the room i was in was their only double bed room find that very hard to believe on my last day a staff member male opened the door on me while i was changing without knocking when i looked up reviews on google i saw a woman post that the same thing happened to her staff was rude breakfast room was small and overcrowded i would never stay here again not to mention the bed was broken and extremely uncomfortable ,0
 fantastic service great beds as soft as feathers wifi amazing bathroom spotlessly clean with great extra complimentary toiletries bath robes slippers etc coffee tea hot chocolate in room and a coffee maker great hotel very comfortable loved everything about it would definitely stay here again ,1
 the carpet is to bed no good,0
 the toilettes were not clean as well as the bedroom there were stains on the wall the breakfast did not have a variety of selection it was the same breakfast for 5 days ,0
 air con no milk or tea in room,0

 location was central and walking distance to most sights breakfast was great ,1
 room 13 was disgusting so much noise day and night bathroom not much better shower sprayed water all over the bathroom bed rock hard,0

 we were not informed on booking that there would be construction work going on so even on a sunday there was a lot of banging going on will not be returning ,0
 polite and helpful staff,1
 the room was very small as was the bath we thought the price of breakfast excessive and diet not partake we will not stay again or recommend to anyone,0
 very small double room with a single chair just imagine 2 5 feet small toilet my worst ever experience during travelle even need to fight to open the door of rubish small toilet ,0
 breakfast was not included even though when booked it was,0
 i don t like any services is hilton hotel my v bad experience,0
 fantastic hotel near the sorbonne on the paris left bank close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone our room was a decent size and very comfortable the hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated our room faced the street but at night it was quiet there are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff ,1
 we had problems with our pram and there was no lift available for us to the first floor so the stairs were a nightmare followed by more steps as you enter the tiny cramped bedroom not child friendly or suitable for disabled access ,0
 non functional air conditioning non functional pool,0
 breakfast was great the staff was very friendly and helpfull the room was neat and big enough the hotel was modern ,1
 very convenient link to conference centre staff are magnificent,1
 location was superb,1

 all the kind and helpful staff,1
 the water in the bathroom was dirty,0
 staff coordination,0
 room was dirty hallways filles with excess furniture looked untidy,0
 on arrival we were allocated a top floor apartment whilst the apartment was nice there had been a bed made up in the lounge area that we didn t require we asked if we could put the bed away and we re told that it was broken the bed took up all of the lounge defeating the object of staying in an apartment keeping the lounge and bedrooms separate secondly and most importantly the locks on the windows of the bedrooms were broken we were 6 floors up and there was a sheer drop to the ground the windows opened up fully and with ease and as we have small children we asked if the locks could be fixed or if we could move to another apartment we were told the locks couldn t be fixed that day and they had no more apartments left so we were moved to what they described as a family suite the suite was in fact a small room on the 7th floor with 2 beds in it it was old dated beyond hot and extremely noisy the bathroom was disgusting this is apparently a 4 hotel we explained that we were not happy and that we had paid for an apartment and that s what we wanted the manager assured us he would do his best to sort out an alternative apartment the following day but we would have to stay in the family suite the first night we were told we would have to pack all our belongings up for a third time and that we would be moved the next day we went off in to london to spend the half term with our children seeing the sights we were contacted by staff at the hotel no less than 10 times throughout our day asking us various questions and completely ruining our day out the manager also insisted we return to the hotel at 3pm to have a meeting all while we were simply trying to enjoy our time away with our children on return to the hotel later that evening my husband was summoned to another meeting lasting over 40 minutes by the manager ,0
 the room was comfortable and it was possible to have a small breakfast in the cafe rather than the big buffet i also really liked the bathroom set up ,1
 the hotel is currently under renovation so you are staying inside a construction site that says it all for the price you pay you should be at least warned very disappointed ,0
 great location very friendly staff ,1
 perfect location with children service was fantastic throughout the whole stay ,1
 queues for bars when a resident of the hotel had to ask for my room to be serviced at 3pm,0

 staffs were snobbish the mattress are old and too soft the location is not exactly close to anything i i don t think it deserves 4 stars the elevator is old slow and small ,0
 the duty manager was excellent with making us feel feel comfortable also george gave us good luck ,1
 the staff especially razvan on reception were friendly and extremely welcoming ,1
 location and style,1

 stained wall paper stains all over bedroom carpet shower hanging off the wall had to clean my own table on two separate occasions for breakfast despite the table being dressed and ready to sit at cutlery dishes and glasses covered in dishwasher residue both days had pizza in the italian restaurant expecting fresh chef cooked pizza got ready made pizza bases not cooked properly with a bit of no friz toppings headless to say we didn t eat at the hotel for the rest of the stay have stayed in many 4 and 5 hotels in london and this was by far the worst experience i have ever had staff were grumpy and constantly arguing in the breakfast restaurant ,0
 amazing room had a great bathroom staff were friendly and very helpful room service was amazing and to channels too best hotel i ve stayed in ,1
 the whole stay at this hotel was more than perfect location close to the bus station n front of the main entrance in fact and metro 5 7 min of walk personnel helpful kind quick reacting to the complaints clean proper rooms in the room there is complimentary cookies tea coffee someone was complaining of not enough of milk i don t think that people should expect a bottle of milk for free in a room it s ridiculous especially if you will mention on a reception or to passing made that you would like to have a little more of mono dose milk they would kindly give it to you wi fi is good bed is large and super comfortable conditioner in the room bath and shower in a bathroom and super cute duck ,1

 i like it s connecting room facility bed pillows rain shower and ironing facility it s location near bercy village subway station overall everything available what a traveller need ,1
 food was shocking rooms tiny,0
 the uncomfortable beds pillows were terrible the air con that was on all night in november which made me wake up with chapped lips because obviously i can t handle the 8 hour arctic chill we had spots of what i assume was blood on the wall and the green light at the door makes the room glow ,0
 the layout of the room the door to the fridge was broken the lights in the room were not working as i visit many 5 star accommodations this was far from a 5 star to my standard we were only given one room key there was no lift to our room we had to walk up a flight of stairs ,0
 the smallest room i have ever seen even in japan in a traveller lodge i had a better room nobidea how a 9 square meter room including bath cam be legal small dirty awful ,0
 room was awful small dirty dingy with no air con very poor value for money,0
 room was very small for two people we could only just move around the bed and the shower over the bath was very basic and water pressure awfully slow breakfast queues were very long so picked up a pastry and left and didn t bother day 2 ,0
 staff excellent location really good they went the extra mile to provide child friendly equipment ,1
 location location location,1
 the staff was friendly and helpful the rooms were clean the beds comfortable and the bathroom large for a london hotel close to multiple tube stations great location will be staying here again ,1
 stealing money from my room based from event card bad security ,0

 bed was comfy,1
 shower was very spacious breakfast was good plenty of free hot drinks in your room was located close to hyde park 10minute walk away,1
 everything,0
 the location and transport facilities were perfect for a short stay ,1
 rooms much to small elevator extra slow and small receptionist remained talking with a friend for about 7 8mn before daring talking to me while i was just checking in not acceptable does not deserve 4 ,0
 it was a great stay for me and my family everybody in the hotel was so helpful especially courtney at the reception desk everything in the hotel was excellent including breakfast when we go to london again we will definitely stay in this hotel ,1
 very old rooms no pool old decorations staff member at the reception was almost rude to us while checking in rip off ,0
 not being able to sleep that s what i don t like it s 1 am as i m writing this i thought it the room would cool down since i returned at 21 30 and have had the window open there is no way of controlling the temperature in the room the ac is off as its winter and outside the air temp is about 7 degrees c in the room its positively tropical still i can put up with noise coming from the street it a fusion of general road traffic people and train station related noise cars passing close by and the odd truck backing up people wandering past shouting and general saturday night drunks shouting if i could stop the hot air blowing into the room i could close the window and stop the noise i can t though even with the window open its still too hot anyway i ve spent years in the tropics so i m used to the heat i ve just had a cold shower and that s helped the last time i did this was in a hut on an island in the philippines i just rang the 24 24 service quality the phone in my room directed me to the nice man told me that i was winter and cold outside so of course there s no ac i told him that it wasn t ac i needed really just no forced hot air that i can t stop i asked him if there was anything he could do as i was going to write a review and hopefully inform people who might want to avoid being transported to the tropics he said no nothing i m seriously considering leaving the room and sleeping in the train station next door with the homeless people i probably won t because i ve paid for breakfast and may have trouble getting that money back i m sure when temperatures are locally controllable and the windows can be shut this will e okay but so far i can only say okay as without wanting to sound like moaner there are other issues that may bother other people ,0
 the best location very clean very nice people defenetly go bach there ,1
 the hotel rooms and corridors are very run down in desperate need of renovation the bed was pushed into the corner meaning one person had to climb over the bed the furniture was damaged and the blind was hanging off of the window not what i expect from a 4 star hotel was very disappointed ,0
 this is in a great location for exploring the sites right by the london eye and cheaper than the park plaza opposite don t be put off by the outside the rooms are modern and staff are really friendly and helpful there s a handy italian restaurant on site if you want a night in with good food at a reasonable price you might even get an upgrade we were given a suite on arrival which had a small lounge area kitchenette and big comfy bed the room was really quiet and super clean would definitely recommend ,1
 everything,1
 the whole experiance that i don t need to interact with the staff,1
 bed very bad and hurts the back staff attitude was the worst the no hotel no yes in their definition no space given to gusts at all the hotel doesn t care about the gusts low value for money,0
 the room size the lighting is not enough in the room the bed is not that comfy i didn t like the attitude of one of the staffs who brought me a dental kit its not value of money ,0
 attentive professional staff close to waterloo station,1
 the room was dirty rubbish on the floor and hair everywhere there was stains in the shower that looked like blood and the drain was blocked so the tub would fill while you shower the room was also right next door to the elevator that was running all night and was incredibly loud ,0
 the bed,0
 room was not cleaned even after it was requested after returning from being away from hotel 9am 7pm roof top bar staff where just rude took 20minutes to get a drink reception staff where not helpful room 909 was shabby at best with none of the features of the smaller cheaper rooms and the sound proofing from roof top bar was not great this was my 3rd stay and after this one i would never stay at the me london again ,0
 i love to stay at this hotel staff know me now and are always polite,1
 the hotel was very close to hyde park and a lot of restaurants with 2 tube stations one street over excellent location the staff was nice,1
 it was fantastic ,1
 despite its smallness the rooms are very comfortable,1
 staff were friendly very helpful lovely bar area breakfast was good comfy clean rooms very quiet x,1
 small but cosy great location and good breakfast ,1
 attentive service and a well managed check in we ended up being upgraded which was amazing city skyline and london eye views were stunning very well appointed room helpful concierges meant never waiting for a cab breakfast was little pricy but a very pragmatic approach to feeding the kids easy walk from waterloo which connected directly with euston station so straight to the heart of the landmark district ,1
 the style and character of the hotel as well as the friendly staff ,1
 tatty dark smelly room worn carpets poor grainy tv shower didn t drain and leaked all over bathroom floor mouldy tiles no cold water pressure toilet struggled to flush no soap,0
 bar area and reception good,1
 the whole setting is bad beginning with the point that they do not have a parking space so we had to use the public parking from the mall 40 day the entrance is currently on the 4th floor only to be accessed from inside the mall the whole hotel seems to be under construction and this is influencing the operation in a very bad way i ordered a delux room with kingsize bed i got a very small room with a double bed from 10 00 to 18 00 you hear very loud construction noise so no chance to rest or stay in the room during this time on booking com com was no information about the current situation construction and if you complain at the reception they tell you they can t do anything for you they don t even offered us a drink for free or something simple even the room service is just from illy brought in a bag do not order ,0
 we were having a weekend in london for our anniversary the staff delivered lots of gifts to our room chocolates wine a fruit basket lots of luxury items which really made our weekend nothing was to much trouble and everyone was very attentive and welcoming from start to finish manger offered us an upgrade or a better deal on are nexy visit at the end of stay we will denfinley be returning thank you all everything was fantastic ,1
 i chose this hotel as it was close to bercy arena the trip was to see tennis at this venue an added bonus was that the tennis players were also staying there too ,1
 comfortable,1
 very noisy room clearly not originally a bedroom space converted from other use badly industrial strength extract no windows inedible breakfast,0
 the quiet i live in london but needed a night of solitude and good sleep this was perfect the whole pool and gym to myself swift service amazing view from the un crowded top floor bar it s a bit corporate but then it s a chain hotel and that s what i was looking for when i stayed love love love,1
 no hot water when i complained at reception they told me there had been a lot of rain whatever that has to do with hot water i don t know also no water in the room i was charged 8 for two bottles of water fro the mini bar and also i was charged an unexplained 3 taxi charge hotel is by no means four star it is weird to say the least d cor is a mix of asian and 1930s style hallways are dark and rooms are very small ok hotel but to expensive for what it is,0
 the small room was infinitesimally small prisoners in solitary confinement have better accommodation smelly just above kitchen noisy straight on front of front door onto street and traffic passes to lower ground floor and breakfast room and noise from rooms above it appeared to be little more than a cupboard the ensuite was even smaller try sitting on the look with the minute sink on your boob and trying to wash in the sink was dreadful when i complained i was fobbed off and felt forced to spend the night because without a refund i couldn t go elsewhere it was my worst nights sleep ever and breakfast was as bland as the room ,0
 food was amazing and staff excellent,1
 did not have breakfast the room was very comfortable ,1
 non english speaking staff breakfast not included in price expensive paid 169 for 1 night room only no view as requested very basic room and no hotel facilities the hilton is far better for the same price stayed there many times but thought i would try novotel would not stay again ,0
 room was tired with mould in the bathroom uncomfortable mattress ,0
 low pressure water wifi terrible noise of the running rain water in the tube ,0
 there was a rodenticide trap in my room next to the air conditioning disgusting the bed was worn out the carpet on the floor was disgusting the pillows were the thinest i ve ever experienced in a hotel the walls were dirty only one power plug in worked the toilet didn t flush in the bathroom and the sink never had hot water ,0
 no facilities to eat or drink toilet leaking non stop water running in the toilet,0
 after our first room was pretty poor management moved us to a new room and it was a much better experience cleaner better view more comfortable ,1
 we were upgraded to a room with an amazing view and given a bottle of wine free as it was my boyfriends birthday was a lovely gesture ,1
 loved the historic appeal and grand decor room was nice and bed was comfortable ,1

 location and facilities,1

 good location for site visiting,1
 the room itself was great spacious and extremely comfortable the staff make the experience that much better with their friendliness and are always extremely approachable and available the hotel location is also great the walk to the tube was a quick one and a train directly to heathrow airport too when it was time to get home so pleased to have chosen to stay at this property and will definitely be back ,1
 poor cummunication,0

 wonderful location close to many areas of interest yet quiet rooms friendly very helpful staff always available with help if necessary,1
 was upgraded to apartment which was not buce at all they showed us another apartment one of their best apparently it was not impressive the bed was a standard double in all apartments even though we paid extra for a king bed it seemed like the staff did not want to give the room we paid for as they kept showing us all other available apartments not impressed when it s late at night and just wanting to check in and sleep eventually got to our original room which was hooked after of lugging around our luggage got to the room had to pay for bottled water usually free in most hotels tv was very old could not plug in usb bathroom was for disabled people did not request this dust on the table tops breakfast is usually included when executive rooms are booked we were unable to have breakfast even though breakfast was confirmed the night of check in overall will never recommend this to anyone consider a 5 star hotel i would degrade this to a 3 ,0
 nice room located on two floors for a fair price,1
 i booked this hotel in advance and paid in advance as a special treat for the new year s eve period for my wife who has recently recovered from cancer post the terrorism events in paris and the heightened security concerns across europe me and my wife decided to change our plans and not travel to europe during this period we contacted the hotel and presented our case yet was told that we will not be granted a refund for the 1600 that we paid for two nights because they said as far as they are concern life goes on and their are no security concerns in paris we was very offended and the hotel made no efforts to assist us and stuck to their policy despite this being a peak period and they could very easily have rebooked our rooms now we have two night paid and we have lost our money for such a prestigious hotel i am deeply upset at how they have treated us we spent along time to choose the right hotel and paid a premium and now we have lost everything ,0
 cleaning furniture staff that was my second visit but it was bad experience they are too slow in handling things they have really no idea for what s going on ,0
 basically no room service tried calling three times in one night no answer went down stairs for two glasses of wine had to wait for someone to come to the so called bar glasses were filthy got charged more than it said when i booked it would definetly not recommend ,0
 great location great amenities transport links rooms had all key requirements staff helpful,1
 low ceilings dirty outdated rooms shower head was awful business centre was terrible with too many low ceiling corridors annoying front desk with the person in charge telling off colleagues faucets fallings off in bathroom food selection in room service was poor ,0
 bed was lovely lovely attentive staff cant fault it,1
 poor staff attitude car park should not be used by woman traveling alone poor check in process srea undergoing marjor building works to the front and rear of the building cold room service food i found a long hair in the bath not mine ,0
 made to feel very welcome on our wedding anniversary ,1
 location is perfect close to metro,1
 i asked for late cheek out i was called by the reception and they asked me to leave the room when i asked for another 10 minutes they kicked me out of the room when i went through front desk for cheek out they didn t answer my hello they have charged me things from the mini bar that i haven t used the manger wanted to charge me an extra night for nothing i don t recommend anyone to stay at this hotel ,0
 although i almost got poisoned because complimentary coffee and milk in the room was not fresh i could have given this hotel a really very high point but they have no interest in customer satisfaction which i hate the most ,0
 see above,0
 reception staff small bathroom 4 pounds a coffe,0
 very polite staff room service,1
 great old building that s kept in good shape immediate access to hyde park and a nearby london underground station were both very nice the staff were busy but alert nice and efficient ,1
 airco worked great ,1
 great hotel amazing location i will go back to this hotel on my next trip to london there is a security gard at night wich is very good,1
 staff in morning could not speak english they swiped my card for 50 00 then said it would take 5 days to get it back this is totally wrong it was not a 5 star hotel ,0
 great breakfast great help with suitcases and with my sons pram every time we left the hotel ,1
 great staff,1
 we arrived at the hotel at about 1pm the receptionist told us that the check was starting at 2pm the room was ready but because we were 1 hour in advance she asked to pay extra 20 pounds that was the hotel policy we didn t accept so we came back after dinner the hotel room was small dirty and especially very cold we were there in december so the heating was supposed to work unfortunately it was not working at this point we asked the receptionist who was very kind and helpful to check and see what was the problem we checked other 3 rooms but all with the same problem it was too cold to stay and we had to live our jackets on all the time at around 10 30pm after 1h 30 minutes we were trying to solve the problem the night porter came and suggested us to stay there 1 night and the next day they would have repaired the heating system in the meantime other people came down to the reception to complain about the same problem at the end after 2 hours we asked to change the other to another with the heating working at that point they gave us anther hotel of the same chain the best western maida vale end of the story this is not a hotel it s a dirty place with no heating small and located in a bad place if you don t want to waist your money don t go there unfortunately i booked the hotel without looking at the reviews otherwise i certainly wouldn t have booked it ,0
 we were without heating on our room and it took 2 and half hours to get any one to try and come fix it even though we rang three times ,0
 the room had ripped carpet the furniture was scratched and worn there was only one teabag for each of us to have 1 cup of tea for the whole stay the mattress was extremely uncomfortable for the gap between the two singles place together was annoying the lighting in the room was poor after having inroom dining at 5pm we returned home at 2 30am to find the plates still outside the door no information of services within the hotel and no iron and ironing board in the room for a price tag of this calibre there needs to be a great improvement i have had better service and conditions in an ibis hotel ,0
 we loved the location of this hotel the fact that it is set in a park away from the busy centre of dam square was great the tram system was brilliant and easy to handle the hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from ireland ,1
 very courteous and helpful staff well proportioned room with plenty of space ,1
 the welcome the nice gestures the friendly helpful staff the wonderful breakfast the location the beautiful building the room was very adequate for my granddaughter and me the bathroom is small but very modern ,1
 location,1
 location was perfect the spa treatment by nicole was excellent ,1
 there was a horribke horrible smell in the room it was horrible we were told when we arrived that we have to have an adapted for disabilities room we said we did not want that so we had to wait for half an hour for a normal room we then tried to phone reception about the smell and it just kept ringing no answer the bedsheets did not look clean drinking glasses were dirty it was freezing cold i was very disappointed as it was not cheap i would rate the hotel 2 and a half star ,0
 waiting too long to check inn may be about 4 to5 hrs i took 3rooms one of the room was very very small reception told me we free un block your visa when i called my bank it was a block for three rooms till this date the funny thing is i paid cash this is what made me so mad,0
 great location waterloo station is right down there and london eye is 5 mins away by walk ,1
 the bed was uncomfortable and squeaked too much such a lot of money for a poor quality nights sleep when i asked for some toilet tissue the next day a staff member sent me down to the ground floor to the toilets because they didn t understand english too well and we had to wait 30 minutes until we finally received some ,0
 due to some technical problems at the park grand hotel we were rebooked to a neighboring property paddington court hotel we were very much impressed by the very helpful and friendly staff at the front desk the bar the restaurant and the concierge special thanks to sara at the front desk for helping with all the transportation arrangements that we needed ,1
 room was a big disappointment ,0
 location good and bed comfy,1
 staff,1
 everything,0
 the location of property close to all restaurants and transport into city ,1
 the location is excellent the hotel facilities very good and the accommodation brilliant ,1
 do not book this hotel when i arrived at the hotel they told me there were no rooms left and that i would have to stay at another hotel they had arranged i was then told the other hotel was in euston i explained that we needed to be in notting hill as we had planned to meet friends there for the evening and that was the reason for our stay they said if i did not accept the other hotel i was not entitled to a refund after much fuss was made amazingly they manage to find us a room in our original hotel the only problem was that they had not cleaned it and the previous guests dirty socks were laid out next to the bed still we were refused a refund so we could go to another hotel we did not even sleep in the bed because we thought looking at the sheets they had not been changed although we could not prove this the next morning after 2 hours of arguing our case i got a 25 refund only the booking com representative who called the hotel manager on our behalf said she had never dealt with such poor customer service and was shocked that the manager had no interest in customer satisfaction whatsoever whist in reception they were redirecting other guests to another hotel so there is no point reading the reviews for this one once you ve paid your money you re at their mercy i never write reviews on trip advisor etc but this time i feel compelled to make sure no one else books this hotel without knowing what sort of stay could await them another point breakfast is ridiculously over priced and cold there is nowhere near enough seats for guests as its a tiny basement room ,0
 staff in the bar at lunchtime were lovely and the food was very good,1
 our stay at the hotel was excellent the breakfast was great and the staff were very helpful the spa was lovely apart from the steam room not being in use special thanks to andrei for his help ,1
 good bed good room,1
 general atmosphere and approachability of staff,1
 room size even in the delux double was tiny there was little signal in the room for phone calls and the handy gadget they supply was having technical glitches the staff where forgetful and not very well informed over all this place is trying unsuccessfully to be something it s not i found it to be a waste of time and money and wouldn t stay again ,0
 the room was absolutely gorgeous and very comfortable,1
 the bed bugs in my room and the absence of reaction from the hotel management the noise from the streets ,0
 location was excellent ,1
 the hotel advertised air conditioning our room and 3 other guest complained in the middle of the night of no air conditioning we could open the windows but the traffic and construction on the building noise caused a lack of sleep this was my first trip to paris and the experience here makes it my last management tried to move us to a cooler room but it was broken too then to add to the heat we had accommodations for 3 family room and the new room only had 1 bed it had a pull out sofa but when the slip cover came off the sofa looked as if a dog chewed on it because it was ripped in several places it also looked stained we are a family that likes to camp and this room was the worst than sleeping on the ground my husband was going to sleep on the couch but it was so disgusting we all sleep sidesays across the only bed it was the worst hotel ,0
 the hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center train right outside the hotel easy access to everywhere the staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds bathroom was clean spacious and airy we had shampoo body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees it literally has everything you need in the room perfect hotel couldn t fault it at all the lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great tennis court outside the hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around ,1
 incredible location brilliant parking and very nice room ,1
 the staff were wonderful and so helpful great service and great people breakfasts were very nice the hotel is lovely and very comfortable ,1
 bed super small and soft and right in front of the door so you have all the sounds and the light coming through heating was constantly being turned off i was freezing in the evening and asked the consierge to turn it on it took some hours though for the room to get warm in the morning it was freezing cold in the room again absolutely uncomfortable and a no go for a hotel ,0
 staff were friendly and helpful we were upgraded to a room with a balcony on the top floor and the views were amazing really made my trip remorable room was clean and tidy would definitely recommend ,1
 the location is very good breakfast is good,1
 amazing cocktails and staff,1
 the tiles were coming off the way in bathroom bathroom was tiny and cramped room was freezing with an a full draft both of which lead to me being ill breakfast was and all you can eat pile of ready meal the food was terrible in comparison to what the hotel looked like and what the cost of a room i ve seen better food served on the front line ,0
 perfect location for my business trips will use agsin,1
 staff were all lovely friendly and helpful,1
 slack housekeeping towels smelt tea toilet paper etc was not replaced daily move of three rooms at time of check in room was a long way from lifts and i was travelling with my elderly mother overcharge in the bar ,0
 nice clean room good bed ,1
 upgraded to one of the apartments on the opposite side of the road to the hotel and felt duped when assured we had at least been allocated the club double room we had originally booked the room was small with an unwanted kitchenette hardly conducive to a romantic one night stay there was no complimentary water or fruit on our arrival the tv was not working and the promised response to the inoperative tv never materialised no promised complimentary newspaper appeared the next morning and the advertised hermes toiletries were not provided in the bathroom breakfast was spoilt first by the waiters hurrying customers in their breakfast choices as there were apparently insufficient menus available and secondly by one of the waiters putting his hand right across my husband s plate to help himself to one of the jam pots to add to another table without even an explanation or an excuse me totally astounding rudeness ,0
 check in was completely chaotic the staff started helping someone else midway through and left us waiting there were no room key cards left so we had to wait for more the staff did not seem professional at all the room was in the basement along a warren and took ages to find from reception there was no phone signal and the wifi didn t work at all there were bright lights on the door settings which couldn t be turned down the room was clean but the carpets and decor are cheap and worn out i would never stay here again ,0
 the price reflected average accommodation however the reality was very different excellent value for money luxury on a budget ,1
 quite large room out of my expectation nice staff delicate decoration close to the sights within walking distance ,1
 very clean location is good near to underground and hyde park ,1
 unfriendly staff hidden costs no water for 2 days for the money i probably booked at a different hotel ,0
 air conditioning not functioning in room 407 on 20th july window screwed in to a fixed position so no external air flow encouraged staff attempted to find me a fan but this did not show up resorted to jamming room door open with the solitary chair in order to try and encourage air flow eventually lay down the wrong way round on the bed gasping for air from the warm breeze created by the malfunctioning aircon resembling a swaety goldfish deprived of oxygen about 2 hours sleep achieved so abt 120 per hour of sleep ,0
 the over all feel of the hotel not good dated and falling apart and rooms really small and pokie over priced travelodge would of been better ,0
 cleanses,1
 would never book again my ghd straighteners were stolen by the cleaners and we were also put into a room whilst a machine stating do not enter when on was in place which caused my partner to have an asthma attack ,0
 ants in the room toilet was in one room and sink on the other side of room,0
 good sound proofing despite the niggles overall its position and views are excellent ,1
 the room you small no room to walk around the bed very dark room needs colours,0
 location style price,1
 staff very helpful,1
 very modern nice views close to subway hassle free procedures,1
 staff kindness,0

 the hotel is using old furniture and not properly maintained the floor mat is old and torn the price was too high for a hotel of that standard the passage are very small its not catering for all persons of different body structure the mattress of the initial room i was given had stains something like blood stains ,0
 customer service was outstanding it was my friend s birthday and we got a free upgrade to a room with a view of the london eye and a complimentary bottle of wine ,1
 very comfortable room,1
 i give this hotel 10 10 absolutely stunning all staff was excellent perfect location will be going back again would definitely recommend ,1
 room size is very small and uncomfortable ,0
 the staff are completely unprofessional no customer service experience what so ever i called in before to confirm my staying and the lady that answer my call has no experience on how to answer my question and no telecommunication skills awful ,0
 4 star hotel only in dreams it is two star hotel you can hear the voice from next room easily,0
 room clenliness,0
 this is the worst experience for me in a hotel never stay again at this hotel ,0
 great location for the apollo all staff were very polite and friendly i will definitely stay there again ,1
 the furniture is too old the cleaning is too bad or i can say extreamly bad even when i check in for the first day the room is full of dust and not cleaned well the quality of the furniture used is poor ,0
 room is not clean dirts scattered all over carpet ventilation in room is bad uncomfortable and hard to breathe air condition is not working well really would like to get out of the room as earliest as possible very small room comparing to price ,0
 staff had little interest in helping me and couldn t book me manually i had to go into booking com to make a reservation the worst services seen at any hotel i ve been too this 2 9 score that is automatically generated is way too generous i d give it a solid 1 5 ,0
 great position staff very pleasant attentive ,1
 room very shabby,0
 wifi not working in the room only outside of the room no tv signal for hours for security reasons window could not be openend should be mentioned on website as some people like to open window while sleeping at least a little bit reception staff just said we are sorry ,0
 area,1
 lovely clean room fantastic location which is why we book here very good for the tube clipper to reach all the attractions london has to offer usually had a great experience but didn t match previous visits here this one was our third ,1
 location staff and cleanliness ,1
 the room walls were so thin that you could hear every word of the next room occupants very unsettling,0
 bed very comfy and room spacious reception staff exceptionally friendly and helpful ,1
 great bed huge and very comfortable the food was excellent especially the breakfast burgers in the bar area were amazing too staff very friendly and helpful,1
 the bedroom was dirty unkept the carpet was stained bathroom needs replacing pillows terrible in fact the room was disgusting we felt dirty in there very poor for a hilton,0
 toilet and showroom is not separated and really narrow and bit dirty once we took shower toilet floor was aslo wet forthermore we had to took off the closes outside showroom when we took shower ,0
 we were treated extremely well it was my wife s birthday and we were upgraded and the room was decorated after our last stay when it was our 25th wedding anniversary and the occasion was ignored we could not have asked for anything more ,1
 air conditioner did not work at all and no solution from the hotel management it was too hot to stay in this hotel in early of july,0
 every thing,1
 very nice staff at the front desk ,1
 rooms not cleaned towels not changed,0
 no hot water no clean bedding overall a very scuffy outfit,0
 great location for appollo,1
 for more than 200 a night the room is extremely small couldn t even open full size laugage on the floor staff unfriendly internet access costs another 10,0
 nice venue and weekend away ,1
 hotel was in a nice busy place with a lovely italian and pub down the road close to the park,1
 frankly too tight no hot water in shower despite several complaints overall i won t stay there again ,0
 we had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it staff could hardly understand english and i thought i was in london but english is not the language ,0
 all round great experiance,1

 the room was outstanding cold nobody inform us that the hotel was taking deposit despite that we were paying before our arrive now 24 hours after return deposit didnt come back joanna,0
 breakfast is good and the staff are very nice,1
 that the majority of the staff spoke english very close to a street of different restaurants,1
 excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important,1
 i just enjoyed my stay ,1
 the staff were kind polite very helpful and you could have a joke with them too we received a room upgrade upon check in the room was fabulous the hotel was clean and well presented we loved it and would definitely stay again and recommend to others ,1
 beautiful place,1
 we chose the hotel purely due to location probably wouldn t stay again basic rooms i can cope with but the bathroom was disgusting and needed to be cleaned properly lighting was also an issue in the bedroom and the hallways smelt damp ,0
 where do i start,0
 great for o2,1
 the rooms cold old dated basic no shampoos soap hairwash no mini bar and felt bloody cold as heatin wasnt workin sink and toilet blockin dirty due to needin a complete revsmp very poor like stayin in travelodge but 40 yrs older ,0
 room was 5 square meters literally about 20 cm from the end of the bed to the wall about 40cm from each side of the bed to the wall bed was 130 cm x 200 cm ceiling was less than 220 cm high matress was at least 15 years old and had a deep hole in the middle you have to sleep on a slope from the side of the matress to the center old reception with tired forniture have to carry your own luggage to room despite stairs on the way overall hotell is a decent three star claiming five star status is completely ridicolous ,0
 staff very helpful and courteous room was pleasantly decorated and bed very comfortable the bathroom was beautifully decorated,1
 bar area was musty smelling and the sauvignon blanc chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy ,0
 the room stank of stale cigarette smoke and was very very dark even with all the lights on it was a tiny corner room with a double bed against the wall you could barely open the door all the way because of the bed the bed was uncomfortable and when we looked underneath one of the legs was broken we picked this hotel as it looked like an interesting boutique hotel the view from our window was of a wall and some pipes the room was not soundproof as advertised and there was no dvd player trip was intended to be a romantic break but the room was truly awful ,0
 the staff was very friendly and helpful loved the old charm of the architecture rooms were clean bar had a great courtyard,1
 dissapointment ,0
 blocked toilet dirty room ,0
 bed was fantastic,1
 very uncomfortable rooms we were upgraded to a room on the 8th floor that was pathetic there was no lift to the eight floor we were expected to carry 4 suitcases up a flight of stairs requested another room and was given one on the second floor this was much better than the upgraded room but this was never cleaned properly no towels replaced and trays from room services never collected definitely not recommend if you travelling with children ,0
 the resturant at the reception their staff verry rude i waited for them as it s my turn the waiter lady was chating to their freinds and i waited almost 45 minutes till she come back to me i told the manger about it and he didn t care he was the one without hair note that always every year i come and i receive the same bade service and there is allot of bad things at the hotel which needs a 50 000 word atleast to talk about i never ever recomend this hotel to anyone if you need your vacation to be perfect choose another 5 star hotel near by thank you,0
 stylish hotel in a great location for exploring london rooms very well appointed and comfortable really enjoyed our stay here ,1
 the room was not clean at all in the bathroom we did not have soap and the shower was very dirty there was dirt everywhere you cannot go outiside after 8 pm looks dangerous not a four star hotel two stars maximum i would not recommed at all ,0
 it is even not 2 stars and breakfast provided bad and staff are rude and the services are horrible the rooms are dirty there is no wifi coverage in rooms the bathroom is not ideal and the fridge is always hot inside they didn t give the wifi password no wifi in the rooms or restaurant no parking space,0
 location hardly known needs better signs and directional signs a shuttle service out would help as area feels spooky in the nighttime,0
 staff very helpful,1
 i didn t like the idea of paying 150 00 for a room which was not even in the hotel but another apartment accross the road in what i would imagine would have been a bedroom was turn into a bath area toiltet area kitchen area bed was very uncomfortable had my pillows keep falling off the bed because it had no headboard or against the wall lots of raised area supposed to make space but had to walk sideways to get to the bed i hated the room and for the amount i paid for,0
 room was awful ,0
 staff doesn t respond quickly the room lacked cleanliness water system not working properly tap water smelled like sewage we requested changing the room but no response the shower was bad also too expensive for what they offer ,0
 we were attacked and robbed outside of our hotel the hotel should have been open and it was locked for some bizarre reason i was robbed of my cards driving license and approximately 1 500 worth of goods i was dragged up the street and attacked and hurt badly we had to beg hotel staff to call the police and nothing was done nor did this member of staff report it to management the next day and we have not received a formal apology i am devastated and anxious beyond belief horrific stay ,0
 bathrooms are in bad condition and badly maintained ultra noisy location hobos in the lobby using wifi bad keep away,0
 the fittings carpets decoration all need refurb breakfast offered everything but all low standard there was absolutely no attention to detail ,0
 haven t seen a tinier room no air con and the window doesn t open the view was some construction material the interior of the room was also very poor more like a storage ,0
 the rooms are amazing the extra touches like a speaker in the bathroom which plays whatever is on the telly everything is of a high standard breakfast was unbelievable the selection from cereals to fruit smoothies and muffins the cooked choices were fantastic tasted so fresh fabulous hotel and well worth paying extra for what you get ,1
 very noisy due to construction site and train cleaning servis terrible old rooms need to be reconstructed serving same boring breakfast everyday wifi paid in the room,0
 the stuff were very friendly very well mannered,1
 excellent location,1
 breakfast was very tasty staff very friendly and helpfull,1
 the staff were friendly the bed was so comfy the walk way to the o2 was so helpful and the whole hotel was execellent,1
 everything after an overseas trip had to check ourselves in stained carpets throughout two people could barely stand up at the same time in room cramped bathroom barely a closet at all old sticky drawers no place for suitcases charging 24 pounds for full breakfast in dreary surroundings the worst hotel that i have encountered in london ,0
 everything beautiful building lovely rooms great staff and a fantastic price ,1
 great architecture,1
 very comfy beds quiet location wonderful staff great food and the rooms were really cosy and welcoming ,1
 too cheap for the price too old fashioned,0
 comfy bed view of the thames very close to o2 ,1
 the property needs maintenance we were obliged to change room in order to get the needed heater ,0
 hotel itself including rooms reception and general building ideal location for the part of london we were visiting ,1
 despite being in the heart of london but the location is very noisy and inconvenient a lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave i would never stay there again ,0
 the breakfasts were very good the location was excellent ,1
 upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after 5 minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted she told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked we did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small when entering the room i immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls my partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat i turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so i ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust after informing the front desk and upon return to our room i was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned i decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath i had to annoyingly fiddle with it then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until i forced it to pull back out on my first night i had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out i proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided after i finished writing i turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration we looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at however we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed my partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish ,0
 not given the room we booked room very warm air con not working no ventilation no room clean up one day had to ask and re ask for towels and toilet paper and tissues running out of both was a problem could not contact the desk on the phone bad lighting light switch behind pillow and light turned on when i moved at night odd shower water went everywhere when requested a twin room as booked they moved us to another double room had to again request a twin room as booked front desk check out no one cared about the issues we faced no such thing as a quiet room construction on one side and train station on the other ,0
 the location was perfect for our night out at the theatre ,1
 made to feel very welcome staff made a fuss of my 8 year old daughter made her feel extra special will definitely return in the future ,1
 breakfast was good room very clean and comfortable and helpful and friendly staff useful to have microwave etc in room close to the metro too and there is a cash machine shop and cafe right beside the metro ,1
 the food was terrible the service very slow,0
 i paid a fortune for a room and they allocated me on the basement there was no window and the room was so narrow that i could not open my suitcase on the floor i had to do it on the bed ,0
 staff were professional hotel was very good,1
 very good hotel excellent room helpful staff very nice bar,1
 atmosphere staff overall facilities location ,1
 the room was not clean shabby and in need of decorating there was a constant high pitched noise in the bedroom so no sleep an impersonal hotel the only thing that makes it 4 is the location i would not stay there again ,0
 we asked for a quiet room which was non smoking we had neither the room was so noisey that we didn t sleep a wink either night,0
 bed comfortable staff very helpful ,1
 i was in a bottom floor single room and it was more like old and run down back utility room which had a door and a full room length large widow to the back also there was no headboard well unless you include the back door as one as a result this room was freezing i can t understate how bad his room was and can t believe that they are using it as a room i only stayed approx 2 hours as it was so uncortable and cold they had no other rooms available but did allow me to checkout without any charge found another hotel around the corner ,0
 very disappointed with our stay ,0
 walls are cracked rooms smell and they feel dirty i put a towel on the below to sleep there is a mirror over the bed it felt like a very cheap motel ,0
 really lovely and luxurious hotel special thanks to gosia on reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you gosia ,1
 bed was very comfy bar meal was fine service excellent ,1
 room service finished at 10 30pm which is to early ,0
 nice service good location,1
 the location was ideal and we were upgraded to a penthouse suite and it was stunning the room itself and the view across london,1
 good ,1
 we selected a smoking room but was not given one apperently with the booking we made were not allowed to have one we have to pay 20 pounds if we wanted a smoking room but if we wernt allowed to have a smoking room why give that option if and when you book,0
 elevators not working,0
 lovely staff food gym ,1
 cleanliness,1
 breakfast was ok,0
 i did not like anything in particular except the proximity with holland park ,0
 1 we arrived at 2pm time that is possible to check in we got told to wait as cleaner is cleaning our room this is ridiculous as they have 12 14 to clean what was worse is that more than 10 groups and couples arrived in that time and got checked in immediately so we waited at reception and got told to sit and itd take 15mins max we ended up waiting one hour we were very disappointed as a 4star hotel should be better organised 2 in the morning i was just out of the shower and my partner was asleep and i hear our room door opening and its the cleaner they came in before check out time approx 9 30 10am i was absoulutely outraged i was in my underwear getting changed when the staff completely intruded our privacy this is not a 4star service and id advise anyone plannnig to stay here to not even bother the image of the place isnt even close to the representation of the service i told the reception about the cleaner coming in and she didnt even seem surprised she said im sorry about that and that theyll investigate ive had no contact from them and doubt i will horrible experience ,0
 the staff were very helpful and despite our very late arrival they ensured we had food and were well settled the room was good and very quiet,1
 decor stained carpets bed base with a thin thin mattress had to have two added for any type of mattress bathroom,0
 very helpful staff willing to help great breakfast and not rushed away as could sit and chat over breakfast great choice of food in pleasant dining room ,1
 location friendly staff,1
 very poor service wifi almost none exists breakfast not attractive at all ,0
 your room overall condition looks poor and old except the bathroom is quite brand new however your bathroom is extremely small i have never seen in my life the hotel room price i paid gbp150 nite is absolutely not worth ,0
 bed was the comfiest bed i ve ever slept in staff all friendly and attentive and in a brilliant location highly impressed ,1

 staffs,0
 breakfast was great staff especially concierge were very attentive ,1
 excellent location very clean and staff were very pleasant ,1
 our room was huge the only thing that would have improved it would h ave been a bath ,1
 been to this hotel several times before its our favourite place to stay on london the hotel is an old terrace building with beautiful iron work details on the exteriors and gorgeous mahogany staircases and marble fireplaces the breakfast is of an excellent quality and has fantastic choice from full english buffet to cheese salad and salmon as well as continental selection the staff are always well presented polite and service is exceptional it is a short 3 4 minute walk from queensway tube station central line so is perfectly lovated next to hyde park and is close the oxford st hammersmith and shepherds bush as well as notting hill westminister is less than 15 mins away via the tube queensway tube station has 1 small set of stairs to and from the platform to the upper floor then there is a lift to the ticket hall so if you have luggage its not too many stairs to lift your cases ,1
 location near train station very noisy at night constant announcements from station,0
 the place was out if date i ended up getting hurt in your unsafe bathroom and now need physiotherapy probably for months worst hotel ive ever used under hilton ownership we have been to several usually double tree at canary wharf it was terrible in comparison it looked like it needed seriously updating and the bath was lethal when wet i could see daylight through a screw hole in the windows which were rubbish as they did not blick outside noise of traffic at all beds were like a budget caravan not tge standard we have become accustomed too before in so disappointed and feel truly let down i wish we had never gone last weekend i doubt ill ever visit london again after my horrific experience at your hotel and then in hospital my 7 year okd daughter had her first trip to lindon totally ruined seeing her mother in so much pain i m so upset and have not even had an apology by email nothing since i returned home thanks a lot keep taking customers money as that s obviously all that matters to the hilton empire ,0
 check in was very well conducted and quick with everything explained and any questions answered efficiently rooms were very well presented and all was as advertised well worth the expense to stay on site at the o2 ,1
 room no window no air condition,0
 very poorly managed hotel carpet was dirty in the lobby with stains very visible at all places my toilet seat was broken and flush didnt work properly shower didnt have much pressure in it the bed was wobbly and even my 1yr old son can push it to move with this big 5star hotel you would at least expect a free wifi but no podium restaurant was awful flies around our food all the time uncomfortable chair to sit on while eating food the staff is untrained and the waitress kept spilling water over the table whenever she served water ,0
 the staff is just rude they do not care at all for costumer service ,0
 we got incredibly tiny room in the basement for two people almost impossible to sleep comfortably for this value i expected much more the room surroundings were noisy each time someone flushes the toilet it s like he were in your room above it all they extra charged and still have my deposit locked i left a week ago very bad experience ,0
 had warned them i would be a late arrival when i arrived at 11pm they had given my room away and had no more rooms pathetic ,0
 everything s,0
 everything,1
 hotel is under renovation entrance reception is looking awful room is run down elevator is very small and gets stuck stuff is very rude and not helpful ,0
 rust on the faucet in the bathroom the finish was coming off fire alarm sounded at 22h15 as someone set it off had to evacuate the hotel half dressed with no shoes staff at the hotel offered no explanations other than it s for your safety no communication from the hotel or apology,0
 the staff was very welcoming from the doorman shacking our hand to great us the guest relations manager dov checking us in and tacking us around at breakfast everything was great aswell especially the blond gentleman who worked the night before thank you for everything ,1
 hotel is little rundown lighting is poor reception area is poor and small no front gate concierge service for the price it was disappointing example they didn t have a spare bottle opener to leave in the room ,0
 clean comfortable light airy room hotel is a beautiful piece of history with the thearter bar the staff extremely helpful and friendly it was our wedding anniversary and made more special with chocolates wine fruit left in our room for us 10 10,1
 the staff was excellent each and every one of them ,1
 breakfast was great ,1
 staff was amazingly service orientated ,1
 the room was clean and comfortable also the free english breakfast was lovely location was great 10 minute walk from underground station ,1
 small room staff indifferent breakfast vey average ,0
 the location closed to underground station and a lots of restaurant and shops nearby the staffs are very friendly and helpfull ,1
 the times gone by grandeur of the reception area and other public rooms this coupled with the ultra modern interiors of the bedroom to which we were upgraded as it was my wife s special birthday all the staff we encountered were pleasant and most helpful from the moment we arrived secure car parking available within a few hundred yards as was the london underground ,1
 the room did not correspond that was indicated on booking cok,0
 staff were amazing,1
 the location and staff ,1
 1 very poor sound proofing traffic outside could be heard and was annoying neighbors could be heard 2 poor breakfast choice was surprised by separating continental breakfast and hot breakfast for an additional fee 3 cleanliness of the room floor covering seemed dirty with stains 4 room extremely tiny for a 4 star hotel 5 staff at reception had no idea about airline frequent flyer program my question was if the hotel was a partner of any airline ffp ,0
 location and amenities ,1
 location was good for my visit and wifi was very good,1
 the air conditioning wasn t working the front desk sent up a portable unit but it made so much noise that we couldn t sleep with it on after the first night we said that we couldn t stay without aircon and they said that the aircon wasn t working in the entire hotel and hadn t for a week we asked to checkout and to pay for the night we stayed and that we would find alternative accommodation for the balance of our stay the general manager agreed while we were there and then reneged on the deal i ended up double paying my accommodation for the period there was also someone else s underwear in the drawer when we checked in i am a very unhappy customer ,0
 the hotel was in an excellent location 5 mins walk to london eye and westminster bridge the staff were very helpful we even received an upgraded room as our allotted room was not ready everything was just as i expected from a large chain hotel the room was clean and well stocked and the shower in the bathroom was amazing ,1
 shower room very cramped no room to use the chair next to the dressing table no room to walk either side of the bed had to crawl up the bed to get in it ,0
 excellent location for our visit to the new year fireworks good party in the bar afterwards good breakfast and thank you for the nice touches as i was also celebrating my birthday ,1
 room too small and hotel doesn t deserve 4 stars only because of location if you travel with friends they can give you a room with one bed never again ,0
 this is a ghost house during my 2 days visit i could see very few people only the corridors of the hotel is too narrow it was filled with black waste bags and used bed linen i am wondering how they got four stars i never expected this from a holiday inn hotel i have shifted to another hotel after 2 days horrible stay ,0
 receptionist a lovely portuguese girl was extremely charming and helpful everything was smart fresh and clean ,1
 all the staff were so friendly everyone said hello and breakfast omg the hotel had a corridor to the o2 sooo convenient for the tennis finals ,1
 upgraded room fabulous view excellent service great location,1
 the size of the room was actually very small no space for my lugagge small bag the bed occupied 95 of the living space no cupboard to put the cloth the ventilation in the bathroom was so noisy that was impossible to sleep the room was situated on the service stairs above the kitchen so you can hear all noise from there horrible experience ,0
 paint was flaking off the bathroom ceiling there were hairs in the towels that belonged to neither me nor my wife and there were no effective lighting for reading in bed other than the main light ,0
 no air condition in the hotel rooms except in exec rooms according to hotel staff no information provided about that in advance or on the web site ,0
 comfortable room efficient wifi great location opposite hyde park but most of all superb staff ,1
 the staff from the moment we got there were very helpful and polite the hotel was one of the best hotels we have stayed in we had no problems at all getting to our concert on time as the hotel is next door to the o2 arena the rooms were superb and we had a lovely view of the o2 and the docklands from our room the bed was so comfortable and the room was very spacious after the concert we sat in the bar on the 18th floor and drank cocktails while looking out at the night view the service was excellent we then had room service and ordered a late dinner and the food was great and was delivered to our room in no time at all and was set up on a table in the morning we had breakfast and there was a large selection of food and even catered for vegetarians so my daughter was happy our stay was great and the hotel is amazing with friendly welcoming staff ,1
 location was the best ,1
 noisy dirty poorly maintained lack of service wrongly rated i have photos of taps dripping sink with waste water that wouldn t empty hairs on toilet seats the list goes on and on save your hard earned cash we are a late 30s and early 40s professional couple normal couple with normal expectations ,0
 the room was a good size and the location was central but quiet the staff were very friendly and welcoming and let us borrow an umbrella when the rain was really bad ,1
 the hotel was lovely clean and fresh the rooms are spacious and modern the beds were to die for and breakfast was amazing ,1
 the service and booking in time your website said no deposit i was charged 25 person deposit x 2 that was 50 and should of been stated i ve atyed in hotel before i was never charge also they moved me from room 313 to room 915 it was next to construction site,0
 it s an excellent place and location is great,1
 the worst bed we have ever slept in and the air conditioning was so noisy that we couldn t get any sleep ,0
 room very noisy at night draft from window making cold spots in room dust on table we wrote clean me in it but it was still there next day after room had been serviced,0
 everything else,0
 very very old carpet all stained in the room felt gross smallest toilet ever seen in my life ,0
 very grand and impressive hotel in a great location to get out and see london also requested an ice bucket and champagne flutes in the room to celebrate my girlfriends birthday which were left along with some complimentary cakes and a white chocolate note reading happy birthday a very nice touch ,1
 water very slow to drain from shower lots of noise early morning from top floor ,0
 location good rooms,1
 in winter you can t use the air on feature in the room and the heating is on sensors so as soon as you return to the room it starts blowing out hideously warm air the whole place is particularly grubby and in serious need of tlc the apartments are very much dated and over priced we were upgraded to one of these due to the heating problems upgrade used loosely it was disgusting dirty and quiet frankly horrible we were eventually return to a room we had booked superior king it was ok at best ,0
 the staff were very helpful and enjoyed the breakfast ,1
 excellent choice for breakfast and food good quality not too far to walk from paddington station stayed here with my two kids ,1
 it is not a 4 star hotel,0
 the air conditioning had an error meaning it wasnt working breakfast was very continental and lacked flavour orange juice was orange squash,0
 1 the access to the rooms were dingy with old torn carpets 2 the electricity in the room was off 70 during our stay there was some issue with running an iron 3 no tea making facility in the room 4 breakfast at the hotel was pathetic hence had to go across the street to have something decent 5 renovation of the hotel carried out from 10 1800 every day on top of our heads ,0
 fantastic location with at least 3 metro rer stops within walking distance very central yet in more bohemian relaxed area than the other side of the river our room looked into the fountains and had a lovely balcony and shuttered windows which made for a wonderful view ,1
 comphy bed upgraded to executive room with nespresso machine etc for only 24 3 nights quiet room clean 4 free waters in the fridge tho no refill and close to hammersmith station shops and starbucks olympia is in walking distance too,1
 location for tube and central london plus some nice restaurants close by too staff were very pleasant breakfast was fresh and plentiful choice too ,1
 building site surly staff dodgy electrics cold room,0
 the staff their best asset from umar reception manager to the housekeeping staff especially the hear of the bar downstairs and the room service guys the amount of sockets etc was a bonus too would definitely recommend and will be using again asap thank you heidi roper ,1
 blocked twice total charge on my card and then wanted 50 pounds deposit still have not got it back even though room was left perfect very bad experience and nobody to be held responsible this hotel not worth the hassle and i organise trips regularly will tell people to avoid it still waiting on my 50 pounds,0
 plenty of choice for breakfast,1
 the hotel was in a good place not far from the latin quarter the metro was the odeon on line 4 direct from the gare du nord ,1
 great location and parking delivered wine to celebrate my wife birthday thankyou,1
 helpful staff very comfortable bed excellent food in the restaurant and very quiet given the location ,1
 friendly staff small boutique hotel nice location on a quiet side street ,1
 trainline outside window which made it very noisy ,0
 room tv didn t work properly and concierge uninterested in arranging fix very scruffy hotel staff seemed unmotivated probably because the hotel is run down and unloved by manager owner ,0
 close to paddington and breakfast great ,1
 the bed was super comfortable and the location was great ,1
 everything else about the hotel was crappy no where near 4 star hotel was tired the toilet flush didn t function properly and was leaking all night and the maintanence could come only in the morning there were construction around and extremely loud ,0
 superb hotel fab location great sized suite and friendly and helpful staff we will be back we have staid in this area a few times and this hotel was def the best for all the above reasons a gem of a find thank you and to claire for being so helpful,1
 comfy bed good breakfast will stay again ,1
 fantastic hotel made the kids really happy with free colouring book yoyo wrist bands and pretend money to spend at the bar on chocolate the rooms were bery clean and tidy and also staff were friendly i would go again ,1
 more than happy food and bed,1
 old hotel very poorly maintained my first had a leak from ceiling they made me change room in the middle of the night they appologized and promised they will do better next time i gave them benefit of the doubt i showed them the rate from booking com they couldn t match it and basically all they offered was a 20 discount on breakfast for all the trouble i had i expected better from a so called 5star hotel i booked on my own went there all i wanted was a clean and quiet room i get a broken toilet seat was about to fell disaster really and with all this they didn t even offer breakfast or anything management should change for sure it s not a nice way to treat clients,0
 room very small mould in shower base dining room very dark and gloomy and staff unhelpful breakfast very dry coffee awful we went out for breakfast the second day,0
 very good reception and welcome staff ,1
 every thing smelly small rooms,0
 before you read this remember for the tiniest of rooms it was 250 gbp 335 euros a night we were booked by trainee eduardo into the worst hotel room i ve ever stayed in london room 377 it s a room you would be upset if the staff had to sleep in if they were on call let alone the paying customers i was a loyal customer of taj having spent time in their lovely hotels in india and i have stayed many times at this hotel but never again i was assured at check if that i had been upgraded as i had on previous occasions instead i have been downgraded to the wellness suite wing of the hotel that was unclean the stairs looked like they had never been cleaned painting was going on crashing and banging was happening every morning the bed was like a very small temporary bed and squeaked with every movement the fixtures and fittings looked like they came from the 60s or 70s all the toiletries have been changed as part of some cost cutting exercise since the last time i stayed and are cheap and difficult to open there was no turn down service on either nightwe ate breakfast on our last morning at the hotel and regretted it manageress was moody unhelpful and rude waitress left us to the self service buffet and we had to chase her to be offered the menu to order a non buffet option poached eggs which were overpowered by too much vinegar in the cooking water please stay at horseguards hotel or cheval 3 quays much nicer 5 star hotels they remember their regular loyal customers so much has changed from my last stay they must have changed the management ,0
 hotel in prime location ,1
 1 decent room considering the price 2 room has microwave silverware and nespresso machine 2 good location close to waterloo,1
 breakfast was just okay family suite was perfect pretty quiet even at night close to all major london attractions except greenwich shakespeare s globe but we walked there just fine ,1
 the cleanliness of the room and no tea coffee making facilities,0
 lovely to have a bath and shower comfortable beds great to have air conditioning friendly helpful staff ,1
 the checkin staff were really helpful and made a fuss of my little girl the extra effort to chat to her and ask her questions made her feel very special bed was comfy and room well equipped ,1
 smelt horrible very dirty and no internet bad stuff and not helpful ,0
 not clean at all the rooms so small if i want to move in the room my sister should lay in the bed so i can move ,0
 the hotel food is revolting was sick with food poisoning for all of our stay would never stay here again kitchen needs to be shut down,0
 bed was comfy staff gave excellent service ,1
 only found one waiter who was friendly and helpful out of the entire staff at the hotel hotel rooms were not replenished throughout the stay only had one bottle of water and six single serves of milk for the four days for two people although the hotel looks spectacular the service and value for money lets it down the only positive is that it was close to the eiffel tower ,0
 loved the small kitchenette with fridge and microwave ideal for families ,1
 staff is not as expected from such a great name of a hotel lack of experience lack of knowledge and i strongly believe they need so much in training ,0
 location,1
 furnishings tired and not attended to for years room stank and carpets stained try to extract money for standard things like wifi gym and pool ,0
 good staff and good room service available 24 7 ,1
 where to begin the other receptionist was horrendous she was rude unhelpful and did not care the advert stated there was a room safe there was none the wifi did not work when i asked the above receptionist she did not care and just said there was nothing she could do room and bed was from the 70 s uncomfortable,0
 the staff are really helpful and accommodating nothing was too much trouble the hotel is very pretty in a great location with a cosy bar area i have stayed here several times and will definitely stay again ,1
 the room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both the corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen it was one of the most disgusting hotels i ve stayed at it certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it ,0
 where to start really we made a mistake and requested a smoking room which initially they requested 25 pounds more per day when i refused they said they found a room for us when we got inside i was shocked by the size of it the bed was covering everything and if you would try and watch tv from the bed the wall was standing in your way bed was broken and it was impossible to sleep i have never seen such a bad quality of bed in my life the bathroom was a disaster as water was not very hot in the shower and the pressure of the shower was let s say not enough to take a shower mini bar in terms of water was emptied during the first day i gave them a call to fill it up which they did but after that day it was never filled again overall a very old hotel i think in terms of the room that i saw and what annoyed me was that our friends got a completely different room than ours i know that the manager will come and apologize for it but at the end of the day i won t get a compensation for this bad experience so i have stayed to several radisson s but this is the worst i think in terms of quality ,0
 the bed was very comfy ,1
 the concierge staff was not very helpful requested taxi serive was double the price than the one quoted by outside taxi companies one day the room was not cleaned at all ,0
 the grand royale is very handy to transportation it was nicely updated and had lovely period decor in the common areas air conditioned ,1
 too expensive,1
 extreamly bad ventilation very warm room near impossible to sleep no cold air from ac just a lot of sound boring bar overpricd not worth money ,0
 excellent breakfast professional staff the room was large and clean ,1
 very comfortable great breakfast,1
 lousy hotel,0
 got to the hotel and they requested a security deposit of 50 which i wasn t aware of wasn t advertised at time of booking i had already paid the room fee in full so the long conversation with the manager and numerous phone calls was just all so unessercary in my opinion after about an hour they said your free to go to the room as you re not paying a security deposit you are banned from the hotel bar and restaurant crazy never again no mirror in my room either which sucked for the price it was terrible avoid ,0
 one of the best hotels we ve stayed in staff are so attentive five star treatment all the way would definitely go back and certainly recommend,1
 the breakfast is really good a complete and nice english breakfast the staff are really friendly i could mention several but now i remember only the friendliness of francesca and gina ,1
 the buffet breakfast was had evrything in hand was well catered for has nothing went empty even the orange juice was well topped as i was drinking faster than water i was also offered veg sausages which was a surprise very tasty when i checked abit on the 1st night at 1am staff were helpful in giving a short car park space to allow my sleeping kids out of the car into my room my buggy luggage were taken up to the room after a speedy check in service allowing me to then go find my booked car park at briannia also prehand i was emailed the room might not be big enough for my kids allowing me to find a quick cheap upgrade to a bigger room my other questions were answered just as quickly i told the hotel it my 10th anniversery in my extra comments when booking so staff can congtraulate my wife when we checked in or maybe at later stage they did one better by leaving a nice surprise im hotel room with a nice bottle of wine some fancy luxury popcorn strawberry cream flav for her belgian choc for me very nice but we dont dont drink alchol but i was well impressed with the thought effort put in the welcoming top marks also on the 1st moring when we were planning our day out on sat moring on our way we forgot about the fresh milk to give to my 2 year daughter but the lady bartender saved the day in helping getting us some warm milk with no charge thanks ,1
 excellent location ,1
 we loved how close it was to the o2 arena and the underground room was spotless and staff were so friendly easy check out which was fab and really flexible with the check in and out times spa was amazing too ,1
 worst ever waldorf facing main street very noisy all the time first night we had a double bed on the second floor noises by the cars can be heard everywhere bathroom is a mass the spray is the most fantastic one i have ever seen it can make the whole bathroom wet and without another one to take shower together u cannot successfully finish washing your hair isn t it romantic the next day they agreed to change us to another room and the mirror on the wall of the bathroom nearly fell down thriller movies plenty of 4 stars hotels around much more cozy than this ,0
 we came down for a family member s birthday and this had clearly been noted on their system and she was greeted with birthday messages upon arrival the room was beautifully decorated and we were made to feel really welcome fabulous location and really quiet staff were so friendly and were genuinely interested in our plans and how our stay was i would definitely stay here again ,1
 staff not educated aggressive reception wrong info dirty rooms no water ,0
 staff were all extremely friendly the location was good hotel was clean presentable at all times the breakfast was lovely ,1
 small room window under the ground stressed staff ,0
 never a 4 star this hotel is very worn out and a 2 star hotel compare to the hundred of hotels i have visited many things were not working and the rooms were not nice old furniture and worn our carpets etc not a recommendation,0
 location ,1
 the staff were arrogant and rude from the moment we stepped into the hotel we requested an early check in and they made us wait for four hours they were not helpful didn t speak full english spoke in french with other colleagues to talk about us called us taxis that cost a bomb made us carry and iron and ironing board to our room they were not accommodating in any way the customer service was terrible would definitely never stay here again ,0
 liked the hotel shared areas restaurant lobby etc,1
 outdated room with loud renovations going on from 8am the breakfast was very dissapointing expensive we cancelled the breakfast after our first day but was still charged on our bill which took time to sort out on check out no free wifi unless we signed up for marriots customer rewards ,0
 very helpful staff good location comfortable room,1
 the staff was abrasive and unprofessional the rooms were cramped and stuffy the decor overall was outdated without charm the wi fi was spotty when it worked at all ,0
 having reserved 4 separate rooms for 4 separate parties in advance i was surprised to find on the day before we were due to check in that the hotel had decided to deduct the full amount from my account without advising me or asking me for authority on the day of arrival i explained this to the check in staff they said they just blocked the amount that it hadn t left my account that they would only deduct the amount for my room however 4 days after checking out my bank still shows the full amount as being deducted when i rang to query i was given some lame excuse about it being my banks fault will not stay here again ,0
 very good location just seven min walk from notre dame cathedral twenty min from the louvre museum modern facilities and antique furniture a nice syncretism helpful staff ,1
 excellent service and hotel looking forward to another visit ,1
 excellent location comfortable room enjoyable breakfast,1
 very basic accommodation not value for money,0
 bed was comfy the breakfast was outstanding the staff were always there to help and never left you waiting 5 service,1
 the rooms were incredible small also no lifts beyond the 10th floor but rooms available on the 11th floor concierge didn t book airport shuttle as requested and nearly missed my flight ,0
 uncleaned room and messy with unpleasant odor staffs are very rude with unpleasant attitude and stubborn and they do not listen to customer at all restaurant isn t good as well i am so disappointed no close to tube station hard to take a taxi not recommendable ,0
 the pictures that is show on booking is different from reality when it comes to the room no water in the rooms even the big ones the ac is very loud the blanket i saw the one under the cover looks old and rotten check ur self,0
 complimentary fruit etc very nice touch ,1
 hotel blocked gbp50 on my card on top of the full price for room without any notification or information in booking com system which i find breaching booking com rules the amount was released 2 days after check out which meant that during my london trip i couldn t spend part of my money receptionist manager in the hotel couldn t find any immediate solution to that and behaved as it hadn t been any issue is not about gbp50 but i may simply imagine that the hotel might have blocked gbp500 for same security reasons and in such condition i would be deprived of any money i had converted earlier to my gbp account before weekend trip it s just can t be trusted ,0
 the scrambled eggs were to die for at breakfast the convenience for 02 was totally incredible,1
 all the faculty in the hotel are in a bad condition i have spent one full day without a hot water nor a heater i also witnessed a couple of time an issue with elevator the manager was so cooperative and upgraded me to a junior suit however the hotel need a major renovation and a regular maintenance,0
 very comfy bed and room lovely breakfast,1
 no a c they gave us a portable a c living room was very hot and they gave us a fan not worth the money,0
 no facility to pay in cash,0
 no sleep due to deep cleaning taking place at 2am for 2 1 2 hours spoke to reception did not feel treated fairly at all will never return ,0
 lovely helpful staff ,1
 wooden floors are too creaky and you could hear people walking through the corridors not made aware of building works outside of the room either which woke us up early staff didn t seem to have urgency at reception and weren t very receptive when we checked in and out ,0
 nice atmosphere good facilities and polite friendly staff,1
 although we didn t encounter any problems or use the hotel facilities that much the check in service was prompt ,1
 we were upgraded to a suite which makes me wonder how small our room would have been if we hadn t been upgraded the room was tired and not particularly clean we were at the front of the property which was noisy and the back of our room over looked a nightclub so it was even noisier luckily our aircon unit was so loud that it drowned out most of the music and people shouting our bathroom smelt of raw sewage all of the time which was disgusting and made both of us wretch on entry to th bathroom breakfast was a very average buffet in a very tired room overall this hotel is very tired and needs a refurb we called concierge to ask for an iron which we had to chase as it didn t show up it still didn t show up at all and we had to then rush out for our dinner reservation in creased clothing the staff were underwhelming and no one even asked us on check out how our stay had been which makes me think that they know how bad it was waiting 10 minutes at the concierge desk twice once for someone to show up to help and once while one person was on the phone to what sounded like a friend i am so disappointed by this hotel especially as it was our wedding anniversary weekend celebration i would actively recommend you don t book this hotel there is no redeeming features other than the central location ,0
 i stayed there in third week of september along with my wife the hotel is just a five minutes walk from the metro station and there are a lot of restaurants nearby in bercy village the staff was very helpful and gave us valuable tips while going for sightseeing in paris also i would highly recommend mr thomas one of the guys at the reception who has very helpful with our check in and other requests the hotel is value for money ,1
 great location comfy beds and proper curtains that block out sun,1
 good location staff attentive but not over the top bit free bottle due to room not been ready nice touch,1
 no airconditioning hot stuffy room poor old windows can hear everything happening on main road unfriendly staff small room bunk bed,0
 double room was tiny ,0
 a very tired and cold room also not particularly clean ,0
 the rooms were very small and the hotel asks for an 90 euro deposit on arrival which was unexpetced not great if you re travelling on a budget the breakfast bar was always empty and the hairdryer in the room sparked when you pressed the switches,0
 price was good egg florentine was nice ,1
 hotel is in the centre just behind the big ben ,1
 room service food was disgusting frozen reheated chicken and fish that was clearly very very very old then i found a very long grey hair in my fries that i had to pull out of my mouth i was sick,0
 when we made booking the breakfast was included but reservation at hotel it was not,1
 breakfast bacon tough fruit hard sour and tasteless ,0
 simply superb it was an amazing experience and everything was as it should be from the smallest detail to the biggest ,1
 outstanding breakfast comfortable bed very friendly staff good location fridge,1
 old world style location ,1
 x,0
 very small room no helpful staff and no wifi definitely not worth the price tag ,0
 double room tiny room lacking desk chair fireplace clothes storage all as advertised in the room description had to pile luggage up in front of door thereby blocking exit in fire or other emergency told management not interested asked for change of room none available asked for refund and move to a safer hotel refused by manager who did not even come to inspect the room room smelt of damp as shower had obviously been leaking for some time and carpet was stained and saturated raised issues again on check out no apology not interested again avoid ,0
 property is cheap old rundown and not what it says it is ,0
 the d cor was good staff were friendly and the room was comfortable the stay consisted of myself and a friend just for one night we didn t have breakfast at the hotel so i wouldn t be able to comment on the food quality the hotel was perfectly located to get to winter wonderland in hyde park a short cab ride or 35 minute walk ,1
 it s very near to london eye,1
 old fashioned hotel out of date over expensive room considering size a global refurbishment is needed urgently i do not recommand this hotel for the price ,0
 friendly staff vintage english style hotel so quite and lovely live night musician i feel such as i live in my own home ,1
 hotel was spotless staff all of them were a pleasure to interact with nothing was too much trouble loved the bar on the 18th floor and at night the view was spectacular so close to the o2 ,1
 if the staff did not argue about what i had booked 3 times i had to ask for the sofa bed to be made up finally at midnight the night manager helped overall for what they charge very poor service,0
 old worn out property desperately needs a full makeover ,0
 staff are friendly and very helpful all necessary things that you want is surround you ,1
 very clean comfy hotel good value at 99 a night in london great location for earls court royal albert hall and tube ,1
 studio room gives you a small flat feeling the bed was very comfortable loved kitchen facilities it allows you to prepare a snack or microwave a meal if you just want to veg in front of the tv after a hard day of being a tourist ,1
 enjoyed the whole experience the coffee was superb ,1
 good location and good standard ,1
 the hotel was beautiful and had great history,1
 excellent welcome pack including a fruit bowl the room was comfortable for three had everything we needed ,1
 unfortunately the staff at the reception makes you feel terrible after a 6 hour flight at 14 52 they didn t let me in my room saying i had to wait until 15 00 the worst thing was a group of pilots came and let them in their rooms at the same moment nh hotels never again no lunch in the rstaurant you can only eat sth in your rooms s s,0
 the location of the hotel is in a really not safe area though it is 5 minutes walk to a metro station but strongly recommend people not to take the hotel since you can get a way better location and way better hotel with the same price i was staying in park plaza riverbank with exactly same price in the first two nights but way nicer area and location also way better rooms and services unfortunately they didn t have the other nights available since i booked too late the receptionist who checked us in had the worst attitude ever they locked our luggage and suitcases in the room the second night since our credit card didn t work out and they refused to take our dollars as deposit when we went back to hotel at 11pm no upfront notice via phone number or email we left at the check in form they insisted that we shall either go to the atm at 11pm at the not safe area or we shall try to make the credit card work an upfront mail about this during the day would be nice very unpleasant stay and not gonna stay there any more not recommending others either actually this worst stay ever even got us really bad impression on holiday inn brand it was the first time in holiday inn and the last time will not stay in holiday inn brand hotels any more ,0
 staff rooms breakfast pool,1
 the hotel is very impressive looking they have a lovely little dragon in the stairwell ,1
 good location close to two tube stations and hyde park quite a few restaurants and shops nearby ,1
 the bed was just comfy,1
 i was completely disappointed and mad since the reception staff are generally unfriendly more specifically brad brad not only he talks to guests with an attitude and from an upper position he always thinks he is right without notification to me or alignment with me he deducted the whole amount of the stay from my credit card instead of preauthorization he claimed that this is the hotel policy to deduct the whole amount if the stay is more than 7 nights i told him i was not aware of such policy and asked him to show me where it is written he said it is not written anywhere and the hotel is not supposed to show the guests all the policies i told him i disagree especially if it is related to terms and payments i asked to speak to his manager he said i am the manager then i asked to speak to his superior then he said i will cancel the sales and preauthoriz again the amount i told him this will not work as it will take at least 5 days to reverse the payment he said that he is sure it will take few hours unfortunately he cancelled it and took 5 working days during this period the amount he deducted was stuck between banks and the hotel keeps trying to preauthoriz the amount and notifications from my bank keeps coming to my phone with failed attempted of course those attempts hurt my credit records with the bank i was devastated and angry but no one said sorry and no compensation were provided to me horrible customer experience ,0
 poor maintainence poor staff,0
 great hotel for a good price in london service accommodation and location excellent the staff is really nice with the hosts ,1
 scribe staff in general at reception and the concierge and cleaners were excellent but the lumiere staff were sloppy and inefficient and did not reflect a 5 star hotel status the scribe hotel also made a lovely gesture for my husband s birthday with desserts and an upgrade to a beautiful suite which was superb the bed was wonderfully comfortable ,1
 room very dirty,0
 staff attitude hot room air conditioning not working long story but we asked 5 times and nothing was done even though they said it would shower broken furniture old and tatty tea making facilities minimal many other problems ,0
 bad location toliet is not comfort low quality,0
 there were many visible damages to the room on arrival which shows lack of care consideration also 3 50 for one bottle of water is pretty ridiculous considering the price of the room the fact that the room was poorly cared for ripped up carpet burns to carpet damage to closet door ,0
 breakfast was great but a tad expensive staff were very friendly and helpful despite how busy the hotel was at that time the room was amazing extremely comfortable and modern the hotel is in a great location as it is very close to buses on bayswater road close to bayswater and queensway underground and easy to walk across hyde park ,1
 the hotel was in a nice quiet location just 5 mins walk from paddington station the staff were lovely and allowed us to check out very early for our flight at 7am the room was a decent size and very modern with a comfortable bed ,1
 the building was amazing loved the dragon in the second floor the staff were all very friendly and very helpful,1
 small rooms and breakfast room no access for disable people unfriendly staff,0
 the worst hotel i have ever stayed at i came back to our room at night and found other people in my room the staff were so unorganised it was incredible rooms are horrible and the second room they gave me seemed to be next to the train or tube tracks impossible to sleep ,0
 convenient location next to my office at walking distance quiet street but near many restaurants indian owned hotel with indian chef in kitchen ,1
 everything ,1
 the russell is a very comfortable hotel with pleasant efficient staff and a great breakfast choice less than one hundred yards from the tube station and for the fitter person within walking distance of the west end ,1
 hotel messed up room booking breakfast was vile rooms were pokey and hostel like staff very unhelpful paid for view of eiffel tower got brick wall ,0
 good bed and generally comfortable room good breakfast but no fried bread or tinned tomatoes although chef did cook me fried bread on request and i was told i could ask for something if i wanted it ,1
 1 we paid for a river view room but got a back room so our room should have been cheaper 2 there was constantly lorries unloading under our room so we got woke up alot 3 our bed was so creaky every time we moved we woke eachother up 4 someone came into our room at 7 30am weird ,0
 paying for everything car park wi fi etc management so inconsiderate when approached,0
 location and some staff was not pleasant,0
 this is not for the luxury travelled for the same amount of money you can stay in better places the gym is really run down it smells extremely bad the hotel staff extremely not helpful the dry clean service is extremely bad staff would not give me a 2 hour late check out ,0
 perfect location and everything you need in a room my husband loved the gym,1
 1 unbelievable thin walls and floors you hear every every sigh of the person in the room next door and below and on top and the alley 2 be extremely carefull with extending your stay prices are based on internet rate after agreeing on the price with the receptionist we went for a 15 minute drink coming back the price was suddenly raised with more 10 the receptionist couldn t do anything this happened twice we started with a 35 pound rate and ended two days later with 88 the managment aknowledged their mistake but refused a refund greed reigns at chsiwick rooms 3 very small rooms 4 lousy wifi,0
 extremely small room continental breakfast uncomfortable bed ,0
 could go on for a long time not helpful,0
 the location and the decoration and the rooms were so great it is near everything,1
 we had a great time the hotel had great condition and very clean will definitely go again,1
 room and bathroom excellent really comfortable bed and huge walk in shower tv ironing board iron bathrobes slippers and tea coffee hot choc making facilities in room hotel looks new so all furnishings modern tube a short walk away we walked to the theatre district in around 15 20 minutes we did not eat at the hotel so unable to comment on restaurant food but there are several pubs near by i would certainly recommend this hotel ,1
 comfortable bar,1
 way too small room uncomfortable bed noisy only english breakfast with nothing else too choose ,0
 very disappointing outdated furnishing unfriendly staff and problems with air conditioning,0
 scaffolding outside bedroom with workmen looking in the bedroom i had read about this prior to going but was told this would have been finished bedrooms were old and drab plastic stirrer instead of a proper teaspoon there are no hairdryers in the room you have to ring housekeeping and pay 10 which is refunded when you return the dryer horrible uncomfortable beds very rude unhelpful staff that made you feel like you were an annoyance,0
 great location,1
 definitely not a 4 hotel we had a leak in our hotel room ceiling phoned reception to complain and the receptionist told me she was too busy to deal with my complaint we then discovered the heating wouldn t work and the bathroom was dirty we demanded our money back and only then did we get escorted to another room no discount on price and no apology quite disgraceful will not be back ,0
 loved the location of the hotel great sized bathroom and bedroom very clean and bright ,1
 they are charging in the breakfast were my booking is bb they charged me for egg at breakfast ,0
 very comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast nice staff would definitely stay again ,1
 great room,1
 nothing,0
 lovely rooms food helpful reception staff pleasant stroll into town centre,1
 the coffee shop in charged tried to over charge our breakfast without asking whether we were hotel guests or not quality of breakfast declined compared to our last stay neither a twin bedroom nor a double bedroom fits 2 guests there is no space to put 2 suitcases i have no idea how western guests fit into it no daily complimentary bottled water not even a mini fridge for chilling drinks bathroom design is useless no ventilation and windows couldn t be opened the sliding glasses on top of the bathtub take up lot of space making more difficult for adult to get in out ,0
 had a double room which was small but well layed out and modern staff all very polite and breakfast was good great location for paddington station as had to get an early train ,1
 looked like it s never received any care since it was built staff seem stressed out and come over as miserable and uncaring lots of shouty paper signs pinned around threatening fines for various things ,0
 very good and excellant food,1
 considering i had booked a deluxe room for one night for 280 in aid of my partner s birthday i at least expected cleanliness i couldn t have been more wrong and we were so disappointed the first thing that we noticed when we walked in was a giant dirty stain that looked like washed blood on the large cushion on the bed the bathroom was not clean and the shower had someone elses hair in it disgusting we had a dinner reservation so i didn t have time to complain about the state of the bathroom at the time i just had to get ready given the importance of the occasssion however i was so dispointed my partner did however go to reception and made a complaint to them with the receptionist advising that they would look in to the matter and it was his birthday i then mentioned the issues and my disappointment myself when i came downstairs to reception on our way out again i was offered an apology and advised that someone would look in to it for us there was literally no concierge service which for a hotel like this in the location the hotel is based is ridiculous we had to walk in the pouring rain in evening dress to the high end restaurant that we had a reservation for there was only one member of staff to be found on reception and they couldn t source a cab for us at all central london when we came to check out the following day i was waiting for someone to acknowledge the issues that we had raised the previous evening which had really put such a negative edge on our stay apart from anything else do you think i could sleep well wondering if the sheets and pillows were as dirty as everything else however absolutely nothing was mentioned not even an apology i was too angry to say anything after i was even charged for the two drinks we had had and left thinking that there is no way that i would be staying there again absolute disgrace for a radisson ,0
 room second class and small concrete outlook poor hilton hotel and if you book threw booking com they charge you for wifi,0
 very small room very bad wifi bad breakfast,0
 we had a lovely stay at k k the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful when we arrived at 7 30 am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the wellness center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until 3pm that really saved the day and we had an amazing day in london ,1
 the location is good wi fi in the room working perfect very comfortable bed tea coffee available any time ,1
 it was my wife s birthday the staff decorated the room with balloons and gave a complimentary bottle of wine and card although we don t drink it was a very sweet and thoughtful gesture ,1
 the room location deco and much more,1
 i booked in for an anniversary the staff went all out to make our stay as special as possible putting us on the 14th floor with the most amazing view of london lovely room clean and cosy i would defiantly return here great location,1
 clean modern helpful staff ,1
 the manager was totally awful he was extremely rude and confronted about his conduct he was more than willing to put me out and return my funds there are a few decent staff members but the manager was totally awful ,0
 small room foldaway bed cramped bathroom no bedside lamps or tables tv can t be seen from left hand side of bed ,0
 the bed was comfy and clean,1
 spacious rooms,1
 excellent hotel great location and exceptional staff top quality accommodation would stay again superb value for money and ideal for access to the o2 ,1
 great location easy to access friendly staff,1
 bathroom facilities unacceptably low standard for the price there is no way you could go back to the hotel looking forward to a shower in fact we dreaded washing cleanliness could be better not in the communal areas which were spotless but in the rooms and especially the bathroom the pillows were very old and there were a lot of soft furnishings around the room which did not seem fresh on the one hand there is a little old charm but on the other the place seemed dated in not a great way and the facilities need refreshing ,0
 great location friendly staff everything is tidy and clean ,1
 couldn t sleep due to the room we were put in horrible breakfast and tiny room ,0
 quite charming,1
 weekend staff inefficient and failed to provide turndown service or bottle water in a suite in a 5 star allegedly hotel wow you do take things for granted plumbing of bath awful lighting of room inadequate hotel generally looking tired scaffolding on outside should have been mentioned on booking first room offered on arrival not great and no others available despite it being only around 5 00 pm scarcely credible ,0
 extremely disappointed with my stay firstly i was rung midmorning of my arrival date to be told i was being relocated to another property then after an hour of phone calls en route whilst on the train to london found i could in fact stay at the hotel despite the maintenance issues that were occurring having had to press for this information firmly and repeatedly i also had to ask for an address and name of the hotel as i could not find it on google worrying to say the least and a little stressful booking com were not very helpful either i d booked this hotel months ago and of course it would be impossible in london to find an alternative accommodation in the vicinity i required at just under 80 for the night perviously they have been great on arrival i was put in a room which could have been considered a closet with a window onto an industrial vent the heat was unbearable and after calling down to reception and growing impatient hailing some porters i saw in the hallway still running late to get to the business event purpose of my trip i was moved to another room and due to time restrains had to just agree to it the furniture was in a deplorable state broken and chipped the shower was dirty with orange scum on the grout and limescale on the head the mirror was cracked down the middle but at least this room had a window albeit onto the back of other properties and having to open and close doors of he wardrobe bathroom to navigate to it later i asked to book a taxi and only on almost arriving at my destination the firm they d used not knowing how to get there i was on the gps on my phone was charged a fare that was 6 more than the going rate for a hackney cab something i thought i was ordering instead of a private firm apparently this rate had been agreed prior to my departure why they didn t tell me this i have no idea ,0
 safty weakness my bag is stolen in the lobby a terrible experience in radissonblu television is charged telephone fees is expensive ,0
 excellent layout of the room and the bathroom facilities size,1
 staff very very helpful,1
 poor breakfast as we had a 3 starts hotel location we had 2 rooms but no one had a stunning view lighting not shining restaurant absence,0
 hotel location near the city centre and transportation free wifi with good signal room comfort coffee tea and cookies courtesy ,1
 large bed separate bath and shower i loved good views breakfast was amazing with views over canary wharf spa facilities were lovely being right next to the o2 was great for us as we were seeing a show there lots of parking easier than getting the train ,1
 newly refurbished,1
 very small room no airconditioning no fan room was terribly hot staff was not helpful at all the location is very busy and it s right next to the train station ,0
 the staff are big time thieves i had checked in and they need by credit card for pre authorisation the following day i get three payments through the same credit card totaling 2000 pounds upon informing the manager in charge she never came back to us she just threw our issue away,0
 poor not worth the money 3 star motel,0
 staff excellent and very helpful very friendly and kind,1
 the staff were very friendly and helpful and excellent with the children the hotel was on the edge of the city but with easy traveling distance to all attractions ,1
 spacious room with nice furniture,1
 location and friendly staff,1
 for starters the lift was too small for me to enter with my luggage which was nothing but a small hand carry and shoulder bag the floor rooms are quite tight and all doors are quite close to each other at times i could not make out if the door that just got shut was the next door neighbor one s or did somebody just balk into my room the room at best was very basic barely enough room to move around only a one side tabled bed and bare minimum lighting which i think is normal for london hotels however there were other things which made my life miserable starting from tv and its remote which weren t operational to attending calls i asked the staff to send some one across to my room for checking why tv wasn t working the guy who came by could not speak proper english resulting in difficulty during communication following which we found out that the remote was in operational and had to be changed it was the first time in my life that a hotel did not activate my wake up alarm despite calling them to inform about it in advance the wake up call came after 20 minutes of the set time another first for me was that the room service personnel did not bother picking up used towels from my room after getting the room cleaned up unfortunately the air conditioning stayed very low to keep me sweating at many times upon checking the temperature it was set at 5 degree with maximum cooling but i was mostly uncomfortable throughout the night,0
 nice breakfast close to the 14 subway safe area a lot of food choose ,1
 my room had a very small ceiling not possible to anything except the sky my shower was not working properly i asked house keeping to fix it no success worst complimentary bottle of water was open and used i informed this on checkout they offered me a bootle of water free it was a joke i guess,0
 location staff ,1
 it was overcrowded and we couldn t even get to have breakfast as it was too busy ,0
 the room was very small bed was small and bathroom was to small to get in couldn t move in there also hairdryer wouldn t come out of drawer so couldn t dry hair well not good value for money false advertising expensive for what you get ,0
 the shower was broken mouldy as we were only there for one night and rushed had no time to report breakfast was more expensive than advertised parking never stated we had to pay until check out very overpriced for the location added extras boosted the price up what we could of paid for in the hilton i wouldn t recommend this hotel was a big disappointment considering i booked this hotel for my husbands birthday ,0
 rooms size very very tiny and very old hotel the clumsy rooms and not fit to live for a family like a dungeon ,0
 our room was not only dirty in all senses the room itself was so old and hideous there was not a single thing to be liked we walked in with flies in the room stains on the curtains and a room full of dust intercom not working oh and we were paying a bomb for this superb ,0
 the room was absolutely terrible noisy not very clean it was lower level and the constant banging from water pipes was just too much to bear hardly any sleep so very disappointed shower facilities very old ,0
 management at this hotel is arrogant there are lot of complaints but no action as the majority of guests are non british hotel turns deaf ear to complaints hotel has a policy of not allowing children in standard rooms with parents so that they can force you to upgrade to higher priced executive rooms breakfast is poor room facing the main road are noisy ,0
 sound insulation in the room was non existent could not sleep almost at all during the first night all the sounds on the corridor could be heard in the room quite crowded hotel,0
 i had a genuine request to cancel the stay even get a credit note to transfer the days but i simply was told that as company policy money was not refunded this was only a few minutes after the booking was done i had stayed before in this place however will not book another time ,0
 extremely dirty rooms not enough lighting in rooms very slow internet you have to pay for wifi even in the common areas and yet its so slow that you feel like 90 s,0
 thank you so much park plaza county hall it was my friend s birthday we arrived to find the room decorated balloons birthday card and all in an upgraded suite amazing,1
 constantly disturbed by the cleaners the air con was damaged and kept making a horrendous noise through the night the batteries didn t work on the remote for the tv had to wait ages for this to be rectified the night bar lady was rude and i wasn t allowed to put drinks or food ordered on to my room bill,0
 we made our booking last minute on booking com when we arrived at the hotel they assigned us a room in the back of the building in the basement it didn t look anything like the pictures shown on the website that it was small was no problem for us we are familiar with the size of london hotel rooms however the dirt we didn t expect the window was blocked by a vacuum cleaner on the outside there was no fresh air in the room on top of the radiator which the bed was pushed against and was about 5 cm away from the pillows there was a thick layer of dust it obviously hadn t been cleaned in ages when we came up to reception to complain the staff was very rude and would not help us at all unless we paid 40 pounds extra for another room type and on top of that we would have to move rooms during our stay this was completely unacceptable to us since the room was dirty we decided we wanted to leave the hotel since the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable by the treatment from the staff the hotel then informed us that they would only refund 50 of our 3 day stay we only were inside the room for 15 minutes we didn t use or touch anything they could easily resell the room to another victim if they wanted to this room is more like a storage space then a hotel room they should be forbidden to sell it at such a price at all any normal service providing hotel would let their guests leave if they are this unhappy with the room and refund them the entire amount we travel a lot for work and never had such an awful experience in any hotel around the world besides the room being dirty the staff is very rude and unprofessional they ve never heard of customer service instead of trying to resolve the situation at one point the lady at reception told us you are so stupid and stop talking and walked away to the other room ,0
 the following items are true en objective we booked a delux room but is was a bit less than basic misleading pictures of room noisy room noisy outdoor room very small room very old bathroom to small you can t even sit right on the toilet shower tiles were dirty shower was broken leaking when checking out they didn t even ask how out stay was they knew they gave us not the correct room we ordered ,0
 nice location friendly staff we didn t eat here so can t comment on dining ,1
 no free wifi and everything was 1000 yrs old and tired even the staff but i felt sorry for them cos it wasnt their fault ,0
 excellent quiet modern rooms air con great shower room service friendly staff and 12pm checkout all for a good price will definitely be staying here again ,1
 location is excellent staff are lovely rooms are small but very cosy and adequate decor in main lobby is very victorian ,1
 the iron did not work the view was appauling the bed was very uncomfortable hardly slept,0
 although cosy the rooms were far too small ,0
 the room was dirty there was not refrigerator in the room the housekeeping was not available all day long the breakfast was served in the reception ,0
 the bar the bar service the room was old and tired the first room had a drain smell so we complained and were moved,0
 the friendly staff and speed of check in ,1
 the staff were very helpful and friendly and the location is great as hyde park is literally on the doorstep the tube station is 5 mins walk away also many shops and restaurants close by for convenience,1
 we were in a basement room next to the kitchen and breakfast room which meant we were woken at 6 50 each morning by noisy staff preparing breakfasts the room was small the tv didn t work properly the fridge hadn t been cleaned out and there was musty smell 3 beds were squeezed into a very small room which was billed as a triple room ,0
 great location spacious room fast internet clean room ,1
 major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience after complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend ,0
 location,1
 the staff were very rude,0
 the hotel is exactly as it is in the photos its a truly fabulous place and wouldn t think twice of not going there again,1
 the bed was amazing and views spectacular staff friendly ,1
 special treats in the room and the attention to detail ,1
 its location,1
 plenty of room with seprate lounge are where the children slept the children were given money to get drinks ice cream and chocolate from the bar area ,1
 value for money in london terms with large room and full bathroom,1
 this hotel would not let us check in because the night s stay was paid for by someone else who was not present and the paying debit card was not with the persons staying on the night unless a separate card was proffered and despite the fact that the night had been paid for a further payment was demanded staff are surly unfriendly and unaccommodating will not stay again ,0
 friendliness of the staff great restaurants close by good variety of food for breakfast ,1
 personnel is very kind rooms are very cosy and beds super comfortable breakfast is very good ,1
 our room was lovely and the staff were attentive welcoming and very helpful ,1
 the aircondition was not working could not sleep because of the heat and noise of trafic the room was dirty and was smelling the shower head was broken the bed was 3 single rather than 1 double 1 single for the child ,0
 the beds were very comfortable had a great few nights sleep ,1
 door of bathroom we can not close this door are broken internet poor we must spent our rooming to expensive,0
 the hotel is dated and old in need of a refurb,0
 we were over charged for 100 euro without notice stay in this hotel for 4 days 2 days booking via booking com 225eur day and extended another 2 days the hotel charged us 1000euro for 4 days 100euro deposit more without any notice we did not demage or drink half month pasr doposit no refund what a shame ,0
 not being told that the hotel is going through a major refurbishment i wouldn t have booked we couldn t stay at the hotel during day time because my daughter has asthma it was too dusty it is unethical not to inform your potential customers about the major refurbishment on the website by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in we felt cheated ,0
 the only let down was checking in we arrived after 3pm and the queue to check in was out the door we had dinner reservations at 5pm and we still did not have a room at 4 20 we just get being offered free drinks,1
 three hour train ride to find that i had no room for me despite booking in advance very poor the receptionist was very sympathetic but experience was very bad made the rest of the stay inconvenient,0
 staff,1
 the bed was extremely comfortable and the choices for breakfast outstanding the staff were extremely customer focused and our room had outstanding views it was very well placed for the 02 ,1
 lovely attentive staff fantastic ambience,1
 noisy poor value for money air conditioning broken sink blockage unless a dwarf could not see out of window,0
 food was horrible room not to standard for price i paid the furniture was broken could hear loud base couldn t sleep should be 3 star not 5 star ,0
 the room was wonderful and very clean the staff was very nice it s a great hotel i will surely come back ,1
 no parking on or near the website pictures on booking com did not show the size of the room were misleading the room was a double for two people but the closet door touched the front door when opened the bed was right next to tea making cupboard i was clastrophobic as nowhere in england or anywhere in the world that i have travelled had such a small room even at half this price the staff serving at the breakfast wasn t very helpful and barely acknowledged when we walked on she was cold and didn t rush to assist although the room was for two there was one robe in the closet ,0

 spot on location very friendly staff and yes breakfast was a little expensive but the pastries were amazing ,1

 comfy bed,1
 could not figure out how to turn the bathroom light on ,0
 the room size,1
 only the location i,0
 the jacuzzi bath in my bathroom was broken the tables at breakfast were tiny and they expected two people to sit at them the wi fi was appalling not a business equipped hotel ,0
 all was exceptional particularly the staff their customer service skills were amazing and not just the odd one but everyone we came in to contact with rooms are lovely fabulous bathrooms beautifully decorated bars are both lovely and the breakfast was stunning i honestly can t think of anything that could be improved ,1
 left dress and they delivering to home address with no stress ,1
 all staff was so helpful to make our stay a memorable one from organising a special birthday treat in the room for my daughter to personally taking us to the taxis every time we needed one the rooms beds were so comfortable with everything you need hotel is right next to the theatre which with children is great after the evening show being able to walk back ,1
 the perfect overnight stay for me and a friend very comfortable bed and the staff were all very helpful and professional,1
 the room was very small the shower was poor the breakfast was to expensive the channels weren t working in the tv i won t be staying in this hotle again,0
 the hotel advertises wi fi in my case it was no fi slow and only on momentarily this is a n absolute no no for a business traveler also three times while in the hotel which wasn t much due to having to go to starbucks to get a good internet connection all of the lights in the room went out it took and hour to get them back on i left,0
 no room key not sure sheets were changed towel was dirty room was a cubby hole room was shabby and bed up against wall which in a room that size is claustrophobic hated whole experience,0
 first of all we requested to stay in the new tower and we paid for it however they put us in the old tower we waited 5 hours to check in the staff was very rude and inpatient even though we are hhonars we also had to wait even more for our second room to be honest the lobby was breath taking however the rooms were the total opposite they charged us for using the mini bar which we haven t even touched most shocking thing was one of the room service employees knocked the door while my little daughter was staying inside and asked to see the mini bar then returned and asked her to teach him arabic he also asked for her phone number she said that she doesn t have one and then gave her his skype name on a piece of paper we were in shock so we went to the manager with the hand written piece of paper and told him about it and he did absolutely nothing about it accessibility after 8pm was limited the ac wasn t working well and the shower was broken i have been traveling for many years and i have been to over 1000 hotels around the world in 54 countries i was surprised that hilton had such poor unprofessional quality of services the hotel was surrounded with poor people who kept asking for money and also one crazy person tried to enter the hotel overall i would never recommend anyone to stay there ,0
 i was woken up by workmen drilling new locks into doors along my corridor first thing in the am huge hotel v run of the mill rooms better value for money at a premier inn the breakfast was pretty poor for 17 50 ,0
 the services of the hotel it is undergoing renovation and they did not let us know ahead of time so you would here the workers all day long the services in the hotel are poor although they upgraded me to club room but rooms are too tiny barely fit the bed the floor makes too much noise and you can basically hear everything the lift broke down the first day we arrived and we stayed 5 days and they still did not fix it so we had to go up and down 4 floor everytime we wanted to go out and it is not very practical the room card had to always be checked after you have gone out as they deactivate when put near metro or credit cards first time i ever hear that ,0
 the room and the cleanliness the breakfast is poor ,0
 the hotel has a fantastic central location close to hyde park very close to paddington station enabling easy access to heathrow express heathrow airport as well as st pancras station for eurostar to paris loved the historic building elegantly furnished and decorated very friendly and helpful staff was the icing on the cake we were delighted to be offered an upgrade to a club room would definitely stay here again ,1
 afom was rude and did not honor the late check out that had been offered he also was not prepared to have any conversation about it simply turning his back on me and starting to walk off very unprofesional and poor service particulalry after the service had been offered the bathroom grout has body fat and orrange staining in it and is not cleaned properly additionally whilst i was in the room on one accossion a house keeper came in which was also not expected or accpetable the breakfast quality has dropped significantly along with the service generally speaking this property is without doubt dropping its standards and the colleagues either do not care or are not being led well,0
 mouse inside the room breakfast is bad and cold several maintenance issues broken such as tv not working refrigerator is not working bathroom flush is not working,0
 the whole place seems to have been in constant dissarray for years and the only work done has been conducted by amateurs the halway carpers are so dirty and worn out that made me sick the room was dirty like the whole place lamps hanging moldy bathroom grime in the shower carpet that was just cut an laid to rest horrible place which should not be open for business ,0

 staff were exceptional especially roberta who was simply fantastic ,1
 the staff was bad and agressive the suite is under the the standard noit clean need maintenance and repair for bathrooms although i had confirmation on room and price they obliged me to upgrade and they took 100 euro per night extra and for those reason i cancelled my reservation for the remaining week and moved to another hotel so bad experience with this hotel and i dont recommended at all by same price and less you can enjoy the hotels in changs elizee ,0

 2 minutes walk from sea life london dungeons london eye and shrek studio,1
 upon arrival after signing in providing copy passport paying by credit card etc i was put in a taxi to a sister hotel only 5 minutes away due to some unexplained problem with my room the new place was ultimately fine luckily but this is not the way to do things ,0
 very tired decor this place could do with a closure for 6 months and a grand re opening i was given a room that was supposed to be non smoking and had to walk straight back to reception to ask for a swap because somebody had clearly smoked in it when i eventually got swapped admittedly the room i got was bigger but i may as well have slept in the dlr station the train line is ridiculously close to the rooms on one side of the building and the windows are not sound proofed or even double glazed to attempt to rectify the atrocious noise i didn t sleep until the trains stopped which was about 1 30am given that i had a job interview the next day i was furious about this paying 70 for the night with no breakfast included is also massively taking the mick stay at the premier inn or novotel instead people ,0
 housekeeping services are really bad and no initiative housekeeping did not clean and tidy our room and one of my valuable things has been stolen by the house keeper also the concierge service is so bad i missed my train because of waiting for someone from the concierge to pick up my luggage from the room and i had to take all my 6 luggage from two rooms downstairs by myself and they didn t even help me downstairs the rooms and the toilets are very old and used they need to be refurbished it s not my issue if the hotel is full and they don t have enough stuff to work in the hotel this hotel was the worst i stayed in london and it doesn t deserve five stars ,0
 que for reception and breakfast was slow and long room was terrible small boiling hot and if the window was left open you could smell takeaway food will not be staying here again rip off,0
 1 very small left it can t fit one family together 2 poor breakfast and no change it s the same everyday 3 dirty room unpo receiving 4 not professional house keeping at all our rooms were not cleaned probably everyday even after our request i found hair and dirt every where in the room right after they clean 5 only one resturant in the premises 6 not friendly hotel at all 7 i don t recommend it for any body accompanied with even only 1 kid totally boring 8 we had an accident where the staff didn t know how to deal with at all because the lack of profeessionality my 3 years old girl had accidintly scribbled 4 or 5 lines with the hotel blue pen on a lethere chaire which difinitly can be removed with a 1 dollar detergent but the hotel harshly charged us the whole cost of the chair which equal to 2 might stay i this hotel just because the house keeping team didn t know how to remove it now we are not talking about money here we are talking about being professional in your job what i mean when you are not able to deliver good job to your customer and clean his room for ten days just nicely you can t come and ask him for this expensive charge for little scribble absolute madness 9 very small reception 10 stairs to get to the resturant which make it dangerous for small ones 11 it s absolutely difinitly 100 not suitable for kids or families 12 either big room with very small bathroom or small room with big bathroom 13 poor connection between the hotel and booking com we had requests 2 connected rooms and the checked us in 2 seprate rooms divided by 2 other rooms this disturbed our family routine and schedual as my husband and i had to stay separated i was with 2 kids and my husband with the other 2 right after long hitic flight ,0
 on the second day of our stay the power kept on going out and we were left in the dark on and off for a good few hours we contacted the reception and we were informed that the electrician was working on it but the fluctuating power supply was affecting our work and we feared for our laptops and phones which were being charged when the power failures happened finally the power came on and we went into have a wash we had just come back from a very long day of sightseeing and badly needed a wash but couldn t because there was no power when we discovered that there was no hot water we were drenched in the rain and was chilled to the bone further delayed from a wash due to power failure so not being able to a nice long warm bath at the end of a tiring day pretty much ruined half of our trip there when the reception was contacted we were told that there was nothing they can do about it that is as helpful as they got basic amenities violated is not very good in a hotel small room would have liked a more spacious one ,0
 was placed in a very cramped room in the basement under the bed was filthy there was toe nails sweet wrappers and dust the wardrobe did not have enough storage space for a 4 night stay tv and remote control did not work i requested an iron and ironing board which took an hour to arrive shower head kept falling down so had to hand hold the shower head was not worth the money highly disappointed ,0

 the room was very small and cold and the duvet was to small for the bed ,0
 the location was great both for walking or taking the tube the hotel was modern ,1

 i was charged 50 euro more at checkout than was stated on my booking when i questioned it the receptionist looked flustered and said she didn t know why and made me look like an idiot i paid anyway because my taxi was waiting i am following this up with booking com i asked for a room with a view and got one facing a wall but they changed it to a street view after i asked housekeeping didn t bother to clean any dirty glasses or my sheets the bathroom sink leaked onto the floor be careful how you get out of bed because you may hit your head on the wall it s that cramped at either side of the bed ask for a street view it s more vibrant and the windows cut out all noise ,0
 charges per nigh is not matching with the size of the room nor facility and service very cheap menu of breakfast limited option of dining,0

 the room had everything you needed furnished to a high standard,1

 the hotel overlooks the river thames and the financial district so amazing views less than five minutes walk from the 02 the decor is stunning and the greeting and reception staff were phenomenal particularly the smartly dressed concierge who took our luggage and made sure we got checked in two hours before check in time the superior hotel room was amazing spacious beautifully decorated and immaculately clean we even had a tassimo coffee machine the added extras such as cotton buds shower cap and hair band etc were a nice touch plus the variety of things in the mini bar too the tv was even amazing it had youtube movies and other channels plus all the hotel information including a little history of the chain room service menu breakfast and even your bill the room also had the comfiest bed i think i ve ever slept in our view was the o2 building i couldn t have asked for a better room lots of facilities but we didn t get a chance to use them we also didn t make use of the sky bar but from what we saw it looked amazing the other really good thing was the hotel have their own access to through to the o2 which means you cut out the walking round time and are under shelter aside from a 10 second walk across beware though it closes at 1am and if you miss it like us you have to walk the long way round ,1

 we had an awful experience at this hotel 1 we had booked the duplex suite however on check in we were told we weren t able to have this room because it wasn t available why let somebody book a room that is unavailable we were offered 30 discount and an alternative room but as we had booked the top room this room didn t match up to our expectations 2 we were not told before arriving it wasn t advised on the hotel website that on the day we were booked in to stay the hotel brand would be changing to doubletree by hilton the staff were all over the place and didn t have a clue what they were doing throughout our whole stay it also felt as though the general manager was unable to actually help us and just kept repeating that it was due to the brand swap and next time we will have an enjoyable stay 3 this may sound petty but i know it bothers a lot of women i know when staying in hotels the mirror at the dressing table is quite high in comparison with the low seat to do your hair make up 4 due to the inconvenience at check in we then didn t have enough time to grab some dinner before going to a show we had booked we stayed in covent garden for a couple of drinks before heading back to order room service which we had seen on the 24 hour menu in our room when calling reception room service was unavailable because of the hotel brand swap why put menu s in rooms therefore we didn t eat at all as it was too late to go anywhere else 5 after complaining about the room service scenario we were offered either a bottle of champagne in the room or a two course meal we took the champagne offer after seeing the restaurant the evening before didn t fancy sitting in an empty restaurant with zero atmosphere they then said they didn t have any so we got a cheap bottle of white wine ,0
 room was spacious and clean facilities were excellent ,1
 worst hotel ever,0
 the bathroom was so small that i was hitting the toilet seat with the door to get in sink very small and ended up splashing water all over the floor bed also felt like large single bed rather than double tv connection was poor with very poor picture quality horrid and glary room lighting with very unpleasant colour for the led reading light at breakfast we had to wait for ages to be given cold cappuccinos would not stay again ,0
 the room was right on cromwell road and incredibly noisy even though i had requested a quiet room ,0
 super small room booking done 1month before paid as much as 50 more than booking during last minute either booking com or hotel directly ,0
 a great room good location and very comfy bed shower was awesome too staff very welcoming and helpful ,1
 good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station friendly hotel staff clean room and bathroom with nice big shower ,1
 very welcoming at reception and helpful great room facilities,1
 very poor customer service by general manager and concierge informed that no water in hotel for one day when asked if we could get a refund and check out was told a flat no with no options extremely poor attitude by general manager when i said this will be my last time staying here he retorted that this is always your prerogative and feel free to do whatever you want the no water situation lasted two days beds are in very bad condition and need replacement,0
 the staff were uninterested the hotel was very unaccommodating when we requested a refund 6 weeks before our stay for the last night as we had to leave earlier booking com approved the refund but the hotel blamed their decision on booking com ,0
 got bitten all over by bed bugs ,0
 they told me by mail that i will have a big room with bed 200 200 and then we come and they gave us a small room with bed 140 200 and we had to pay 50 extra for a baby 1 year who sleeps with us wasnt comfortable at all dissapointted ,0
 awful humming noise in room probably from downstairs restaurant couldn t sleep with constant noise ,0
 service is not good at all and facility too,0
 the fridge was broken we was going to drink the champagne but it was warm we informed reception they said they fix it so we could drink on return wasn t fixed still warm the shower door didn t shut hoovering outside our room at 7 35 in the morning lights were broken very disappointed as the location was perfect and would stay regularly,0
 f you have an last minute change to poatpone your check in they would be no favor of helping you very bad,0
 very helpful reception staff,1
 had booked a double room at the hotel and was told on arrival there was only a singe bed room in a different location was left with no choice i was told double rooms were fully booked room and standard of property was very poor shower room was terrible would not recommend anybody to stay here unless you are given a room in the hotel they compensated me with full breakfast ,0
 the rooms were brand new due to being newly refurbished,1
 the male receptionist whose on morning shift,0
 very comfortable room and within easy walking distance of tube and bus shops near to local attractions,1
 our room was extremely basic small it wasn t very clean there is no restaurant bar or comfy seating area it is not a luxury hotel more of a luxury hostel the sound transfer from the adjoining rooms was so loud it sounded like renovations were taking place our room could have used some not at all suitable for a family stay as no out of room facilities ,0
 location of the room was good,1
 comfortable rooms with decent beds very clean and quite spacious bathroom nice and clean with bath and shower over it really nice freshly cooked breakfast on both mornings of our stay ,1
 overall great price for central london some minor issues with the shower sink but very minor really not impeccably clean but not what i d call dirty either windows could use a cleaning room is small but plenty big for just me and again great price for central london staff was friendly and having the hotel bar open until 1a is great considering every other pub closes at 11p or midnight plenty of food options and pubs nearby and the picadilly line is one block away i stayed here 12 nights on business vacation and would definitely stay again for the price i paid ,1
 brilliant a wonderful property with excellent staff nothing is too much trouble incredible attention to detail regarding my preferences from previous stays very expensive but worth it for a really indulgent stay ,1
 breakfast was good staff was very polite location is perfect ,1
 everything else,0
 internet breakfast gym,0
 excellent bar area and staff just generally all round was great,1
 staff seemed unwilling to help appeared to be uninterested in interacting with myself a customer overall mood was dull ,0
 rooms are too small and our room was not cleaned tidy before we was allocated it,0
 the room was very cold there was no fridge beds were hard air conditioning was on all night and very noisy,0
 they had a choice of pillows first time i have seen that ,1
 hotel was extremely nice staff were fantastic ,1
 excellent breakfast with vast choice and fresh food ,1
 very tired hotel smelly damp dark and very depressing definitely not deserving of 4 star no complimentary water to drink in room which you would expect and they have no idea how to read booking com confirmations they tried to charge extra 76 euros for breakfast we had already paid in advance,0
 firstly when we got in our room and started to unpack we found a pair of ladies underwear not my wife s then my wife found a pubic hair in the bath the next morning at breakfast my wife went to have some cheese which was in a wrapper and noticed it was a month out of date we told a woman that looked like she was managing the breakfast about the cheese in which she did say sorry and walked off with it after that we did not see her again and we was there for at least another half a hour after to top it all off as we checked out we went down to the car park to set off home as we got to the shutters they did not open so we parked back up and went to reception to find out how we get out that s when we got told that we need a car park coin to get out why we was not given this when we checked out i don t know as i paid for the parking whilst checking out so then we finally thought we was ready to go but no we couldn t get out still because the had done the same to two other cars my wife went back upstairs to tell them what was going on she came back down with a caretaker sort of guy who said to my wife i don t know why they always do this meaning this is an ongoing problem the staff where rubbish at this hotel they defiantly need more training i would not recommend this hotel and i most certainly never stay there again,0
 the room was in a basement in a different building to the hotel the telephone didnt work in the bedroom and the handle came off in the ensuite and i was stuck in there trying to get out awful place ,0
 stayed here a few times now and love everything about this hotel the staff have really stepped upto the mark since first opening where we experienced a few teething problems very friendly and know what their doing a beautiful hotel walkway to the 02 can t fault it ,1
 nothing ,0
 we felt the rooms were small and congested that s the only snag otherwise perfect location ,1
 the room was the size of a shoebox downstairs on its own i felt very under valued as a customer 7am breakfast room not ready and staff excuse was that breakfast was new took 20 minutes to get poached eggs and could not even get my order right did not get even a thank you as i checked out,0
 the staff were unhelpful and charge 4 for things to be brought to the room e g extra towels toothbrush etc there were no slippers or gowns supplied and me and my partner paid for late checkout and were then told we couldn t check out when we d wanted too i d never use again ,0
 breakfast was fantastic,1
 very convenient location friendly staff always happy and eager to assist beautifull hotel sumptuously decorated i had a junior double room which had a large bathroom with bath and shower great for relaxing at the end of a busy day ,1
 bed was so comfortable and the view amazing,1
 the breakfast was not bad,0
 their attitude towards me and friend,0
 when we arrived the hotel had only been open 3hrs brand new the staff were very attentive and friendly the bars restaurant were gleaming and the room was to die for very clean and comfortable ,1
 position is hard to beat slap bang in the middle of the city a 2min walk to the london eye really good place ,1
 very poor staying nevermore,0
 tea and coffee not available in one room room 3 smelled very bad of damp for 360 per night no car parking for nearly 700 for 2 rooms for 1 night,0
 nice and accurate service team,1
 they upgraded me to a suite at 1am i had to ask reception to change the room as the iron stairs in the room kept shaking on their own ,0
 the pic were mis leading and the aminties werent describe very well for what we paid for i could of stay at a another hotel that encluded everything w it very disappointed in the service all around and for three people very sad to say and our room was dirty and a dirty bed sheet we did not enjoyed it we even left a day earlie because of what happen ,0
 location helpful staff,1
 very warm friendly polite and helpful staff i really like them hotel location is perfect walking distance to bus and station you could walk to harrods as well right face to kensington palace i love go jogging there in the morning ,1
 went to see rod stewart the location is ideal for the o2 arena the staff were all helpful friendly and the bed extra comfy breakfast was amazing i would definitely stay again ,1
 breakfast was not included in the whole stay so we had to purchase it separately and in the end it was not tasty all not a big variety of stuff that you can actually eat ,0
 there was a bucket in the lobby to catch drips from the ceiling i was forced to pay our stay in advanced because i didn t have my credit card with me and they couldn t use the one i gave booking com for the non refundable reservation i never expected to have to pay anything after making that reservation every morning i wasted 10m to get to the ground floor because one of the lifts wasn t working at breakfast i was handed a dirty cup and the way food was handled made me lose my appetite there were no conveniently placed power plug in the room the wifi was ridiculously expensive ,0
 lovely reception full of beautiful flowers and the reception team could not have been more welcoming ,1
 the staff and the hotel were brilliant,1
 location confortable price,1
 room was dirty there were no hot water that i could not have a shower and had to changed my hotel the next morning also wifi was not working i wonder how this hotel marked as 4 star hotel in london ,0
 hotel location,1
 pre authorisation payment taken but not told by staff how much i have been told by my own bank it can take several days before park plaza refund that to my account don t fall into the same honey trap that i did the manager assured me they would look at it they did not 190 00 is not peanuts ,0
 location facilities and strange that pork and alcohol not available may not have wanted it but nothing to say it wasn t available,0
 we had an excellent stay at park plaza county hall reception and concierge staff were very polite and helpful we will definately try to stay here on our next break in london ,1
 on the edge of hyde park and minutes from queensway tube station means an ideal location plenty of character and breakfast is excellent ,1
 very comfortable bed quiet room as requested polite and efficient staff ,1
 staff very slow and bad behaviour ,0
 first night we were given room no 1 and from 4 30 am we were woken up by deliveries trollies being pushed and extremely noisy elevator bottom mechanism that was only on other side of a thin wall it was so bad we had to take ear plugs and stuff them in our ears to manage a bit more sleep room no 1 should not be given to guests unless they are seriously hearing impaired ,0
 very noisy uncomfortable bed bed not made properly sloppy housekerping tiny tiny room rip off,0
 the welcome at reception dirty bathroom no decent space to have breakfast in the room,0
 there was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel our room was very comfortable and a good size for a london hotel it was clean tidy and well equipped the staff were first class they were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot the breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality we will certainly pay a return visit ,1
 i was in a basement room with single glazing directly outside was the metal staircase and access point for deliveries which woke me up each morning before 6am ,0
 no value for money,0
 room,0
 when i arrived after 2 days of travelling i was told that my room would only be ready in 24 hours and that i should take a cab to one of their other hotels stay there for a day them repack and move back to the grand royale the rooms are all dirty dust on the skirting boards rooms are painfully small bathrooms are so small you battle to even dry yourself after a shower front office staff were abrupt unfriendly and seemed barely willing to assist with calling the manager one of the worst hotel experiences i have ever had in london ,0
 location with scenes over the river were fantastic and the panoramic view at night was beautiful looking over london all lit up hopefully you can produce a photograph that people can buy,1
 loved the quality of the hotel and the comfort of the beds was impressed with the facilities in our room although the coffee machine did not work at 159 per night it would have been great if breakfast was included overall i was impressed with the hotel and would definitely stay there again ,1
 room size bed too short poor plumbing dirty room noisy towels too thin and small ,0
 very clean rooms with comfy beds ,1
 the location and the easy travelling to where we needed to be as we were in london for a purpose not a holiday ,1
 there is security issue at the hotel since there is no doorman at the hotel entrance so anyone can get into the hotel easily ,1
 noisy and next to public toilet and drains were smelly,0
 staff welcoming and engaging ,1
 location and quality of the facilities available i believe we had one of their refurbished rooms ,1
 the hotel staff were extremely helpful and polite and gave us so much assistance with sorting out the room and charges the bar was light and welcoming and the staff were attentive and friendly you certainly get what you pay for ,1
 everything about our stay in the room was poor nothing like the descriptions given and photos shown dirty smelly and uncomfortable ,0
 very comfortable bed the squishiest i have ever slept in spa and pool fabulous close proximity 5mins walk to the o2 brilliant hotel ,1
 one person at front desk was sullen the room was not clean dirty walls clothes from previous guests still in closet the bed was not comfortable the ac was too noisy and the comforter was too thick,0
 our room was across the street and then down into the basement our view from our window was bricks and a big steel vent pipe we could hear the underground trains and the noise from above was ridiculous the room was so dark the lights had to be turned on as soon as we entered the fire exit green light was broken so at night the whole room lite up green the breakfast was cold and the young lady in the restaurant was useless we constantly had to ask for items to be refilled or replenished ,0
 welcoming and comfortable and clean great facilities in the room comfortable bed,1
 got a parking ticket through the post after a week for staying at the hotel and parking in the carpark whilst providing details on checkin i have disputed and awaiting apology from parking eye who manages the car park and commination between the hotel and parking operatives need to improve ,0
 staff really friendly and professional breakfast fantastic standard room a little small but clean modern and had everything you need,1
 i have used this hotel since 2010 staying with them through their refurbishment process the rate charged reflected a refurbished 4 hotel the room provided was old not refurbished and realistically 2 quality hotel was unmoved to my concern offered no adjustment to the misrepresented facility i accepted the rate for 6 years of customer service is blown i will look elsewhere from now on ,0
 convenient for the apollo and tube short walking distance,1
 nothing to like ,0
 lovely comfy sleep staff brilliant and more than helpful beautiful bar stunning building and interesting titanic connection very reasonably priced meals ,1
 comfortable beds,1
 lovely hotel with well kept stylish rooms,1
 everything ,1
 small room not very clean cold room w o heating only smoking rooms available very expensive and no free wifi in room,0
 staff was accommodating esp when i had super late check in without informing them beforehand beautiful lobby and dining hall ,1
 bed and pillows were really comfy all the staff were very helpful and welcoming lovely hotel ,1
 staff friendly and helpful good food great to have an expresso machine in the room ,1
 bad behavior of staffs receptionists and check in counter desk reservations department all should be trained again and again ,0
 the staff were extremely professional friendly helpful the mobile phone hotel property that was given to guests during their stay was very useful small touches like having a basket of apples a box of tissues at reception gave a welcoming feel also the extra amenities that were provided in the room upon arrival were appreciated ,1
 cleanliness the carpet sofa bed are old and too dirty many germs and mold were on the bathroom wall breakfast was same thing every day and the products were low quality room facilities we were three but they put one of everything in the room room service they brought services with so much delay and also there was no one before 7am to help us for carrying luggages pool was closed and hotel didn t let us know about it before reservation air flow in the room was awful because the windows were fixed we couldn t open them and toilet fan didn t work correctly ,0
 the staff are really rood i called booking also they ignore me and the whole stuation really disappointed,0
 it would have been nice to have been informed of all the building works that were taking place prior to our stay there were builders and dirt everywhere,0
 location,1
 amazing breakfast and the staff couldn t do enough to help throughout our stay ,1
 been at this hotel before and never been disappointed special touch with the receptionist diana who sent a note under our door to wish my wife and me a good night at the concert we had booked what a lovely little touch well done ,1
 there was construction going on starting 9am also for 2 nights the fire alarm rang un the middle of the night,0
 staff great location,1
 cheapest in the area for a reason unfortunately 169 was still far too much for a cramped room with a tiny double bed and a shower that s shorter than me the shabby look i can deal with but the staff staring at us while we were waiting for friends in the reception bar area was a bit off the breakfast tasted of dust but i imagine it s difficult to find fresh ingredients when you re in central london i guess all of the other establishments have scooped them up shouldn t moan as that was included in the price and service at breakfast again reminded us that it was cheap ,0
 the club room was a really tired standard room bed was hard and the sheets were torn booked two nights and was upgraded after they did not have outcrops available when we arrived bathrooms old and tired black hair on bathroom floor when we arrived avoid room 601 air con not working either in our room mirrors in the lift were dirty someone had stuffed a tissue in the mirror and it remained there all weekend ,0
 the reception staff are lovely ,1
 i liked the whole experience from checking in to checking out and hotel is in a good location ,1
 everrything was excellent the staff could t have been anymore helpful as a disabled customer i would recommend this hotel to any disabled traveler visiting london ,1
 air conditioning very noisy throughout night breakfast only warm bacon salty bed creaky and not comfortable stairs and room dusty bathroom smelt musty view non existence,0
 the spa area was awful and the bed was terrible i expect a double bed when i book a room not two singles pushed together,0
 the room was big enough and the bed is good the breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening many people are having picnics and do some bicycling ,1
 staff so rude terms and conditions of pre authorisation shown nowhere before visit skirting board damaged very dangerous cleanliness of room not great i checked in and within 10 minutes i checked out what a waste of money was promised view of olympic stadium got given the view of a different side construction and very loud ,0
 the breakfast food quality is the worst ever internet connection is very slow if you re considering using it for your work purposes forget it towels where worn out and dirty ,0
 rude lazy staff very unhelpful and uninterested ,0
 the receptionist wanted us to park in an expensive public car park cause they were not informed that there is free parking after 1 30pm saturday and on sunday rooms are super tiny and the train noise if so mear as if he would cross the room,0
 no heat or hot water for the time i was there,0
 beds are horrible couldnt sleep all night bathroom needed some maintenance not a 4 class for me,0
 staff rude restaurant meal terrible noisy corridors surrounding area not the nicest ,0
 staff not helpful no one attending the bar area no one helped us with our baggage generally overall useless,0
 staff were nice and breakfast was good ,1
 breakfast terrible failed to clean room one day,0
 i did ask for a slightly earlier check in 12 instead of standard 2pm as i had just travelled from australia they had not received this request i only had to wait for one hour instead of two this was greatly appreciated lovely bathroom for a small room ,1
 this booking was a complete disappointment the hotel is old and worn down with cracks in the walls and stained carpets although i had requested a double bed i was given a room with two singles the desk clerk asserted i had received what i had requested despite being shown my email stating the contrary accessing the hotel requires passing through the pub which is problematic when the pub is closed in the morning after leaving the hotel in the morning around 8 00 to go to an atm i had to knock at the door and wait for the staff to let me back in the free wifi requires entering your mobile number and waiting for a code this doesn t work with a tablet or laptop we saw that the staff had attempted to acquire the code for another customer but the effort was not successful ,0
 the best hotel at london,1
 this place is pretty tired staff is uninspired facilities are drab needs a complete overhaul ,0
 very new modern hotel with great views of the thames ,1
 tyey did not have how water so we could not have a shower in the morning this is not acceptable ,0
 spectacular breakfast and staff and very attentive to guest needs evreryone speaks english also a plus ,1
 the quiet location of this hotel but still very centrally located in paris the reception staff was very friendly and helpfull haven t seen xavier without a smile love the decoration in the hotel room lobby and all other areas ,1
 nice hotel great location perfect for site seeing and there s plenty of local restaurants in the area,1
 small clean room and comfortable bed bathroom clean good towels,1
 i got upgraded for free to a penthouse thanks free wifi and midday checkout was a plus ,1
 no ac and it was written in bokking with ac bad smelling coredoer and room very dusty window and dirty carbit,0
 i requested a late check out and no one know anything about it and we constantly got pressured to leave the room,0
 horrible smell in all rooms we asked to change rooms but the smell remained the same no possibility to open the windows the rooms are tiny and the furnitures outdated ,0
 the room lacked space no extras just a place to sleep overpriced ,0
 clean and modern room,1
 the location was wonderful near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites the public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website that s why i picked this hotel in my price range all the hotel rooms in london were extremely small but the grand royale london hyde park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest the rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious ,1
 the room itself was so old fashioned they are in definate need of a total revamp curtains carpets etc bathroom taps were full of limescale parts missing shortage of electrical sockets i m glad i was only there for one night ,0
 room smelt of smoke room looked tired and shabby ,0
 shower was amazing,1
 the friendly staff the contrasting restaurants and the choice at breakfast,1
 great location lovely hotel ,1
 no food or drink in stock spraying air freshener near the breakfasts the food that they did have random bits i e just chicken no chips or salad was sent back as it was cold and appeared reheated bedroom mattresses were flat do not stop here shocking ,0
 on entry into room which was tiny there were dirty towels in bathroom dirty glass security not good as my friend has someone in her room,0
 the room was too small making it too hot you couldn t swing a cat in it ,0
 very quiet location and convenient to stations,1
 tiny very noisy room traffic ,0
 i booked one superior for 5 nights room too much small room mattress broken refrigerator does not work staff change after 3 days i call few times for this sheets never changed in 5 nights 4 stars hotel for me no sorry for one day the elevator does not work bad hotel and bad services i paid 148 00 euro for nights too expensive,0
 not good in cleaning rooms they put us beside the elevator it was so noisy no water in the refrigerator,0
 everything was extremely old everything except maybe some of the staff the hallways and especially our room felt ancient and worn extremely tired the paint jobs were less than half hearted and the crowning was gaping everywhere the bathroom seemed nice at first glance but nothing in the bathroom was sealed coulked properly so everything shifted even the bathroom counter the room felt like third rate coffee was free but nothing else was complimentary the room was full of extra things to buy the bed was atrocious as soon as i laid in it the only thing i could think i wonder how many countless people have slept her before it was basically two individual ruts once you laid down you were stuck in the rut extremely uncomfortable i know it s not a huge deal but at one point i needed a coffee and it took the barista 15 minutes to make a coffee from an espresso machine but at least it wasn t horrible one of the worst parts terrible conditions aside was that there was this trainee that was helping us now the trainee herself was extremely kind and gracious as there had been an issue with the booking of our room being too small to fit an extra bed but what was absolutely unacceptable was that the other experienced staff was incredibly rude to her she obviously needed a tiny bit of guidance on her first week policies and uncommon things pop up in any work environment and the customer should never ever have to witness another employee belittling his co worker this was outrageous and the employee should be let go behavior unbecoming of any staff member in the least the experienced member wasn t helpful in answering any of her questions or guiding her in what the process was and how to amend it truly unacceptable i would never stay here again not if i was invited back for free ,0
 the location is nearby 2 train stations queensway and bays water there were lots of eateries nearby ,1
 the room was supposed to be a superior double room it wasn t at all the window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned you could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed for this price not including breakfast the hotel was very unsatisfactory a terrible cheek i would definitely want some money back i would never go to this hotel again they are cheats ,0
 lack of access to free wifi in the room it was very discomforting free wifi which one has to refresh every 30mins was only available at the lobby,0
 fabulous room everything you needed complimentary toiletries bathroom spotlessly clean with all mod cons big fluffy towels coffee maker kettle tea coffee milk and a safe in the room big comfy bed pillows very quiet area good nights sleep staff were very helpful happy and friendly location perfect for the o2 sky bar superb views breakfast was fantastic one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in we would definitely recommend ,1
 good hotel friendly staff,1
 staff really friendly and was very nice,1
 room very clean and comfortable although small ,1
 rooms are miniscule the room i was offered was 1m50 by 2m without a window stuffy and claustrofobic when i asked for a better room i got a one with a window yet with a smelly bathroom poor reception tv and it was 2 by 2m with the bed in there there was approx 70cm by 70 cm to manoevre aside from the ally next to the 1m by 1 5m bathroom ,0
 the air conditioning didn t work i asked for a room for three people 2 adults and one child and they give me a one single bed room like we are all going to share one bed and one duvet when i told them i booked a room for three people the receptionist was like there s nothing i can do about it this was just terrible service i was a regular customer going on a monthly basis i m never going again now ,0
 beautiful room warm and strong shower beautiful spiral staircase ,1
 very comfortable room excellent amenities peaceful to step away from london crowds be greeted by the green elephant staff were always welcoming ,1
 room size was horrible and it was on ground floor capturing all street noise not quite appealing and defo doesn t worth 135 pounds a night,0
 clean and good location,1
 everything about this hotel,1
 very nice room great bed and pillows,1
 great location great staff great facilities ,1
 i was given a tiny room with no window broken light and funny smell i mean is it even legal to have a bedroom with no window it was then swapped for a single room with a window but gosh this place needs some serious updating it s not cheap enough to justify the bad state of facilities and rooms ,0
 breakfast is amazing very kind staff,1
 bedroom was a disgrace very very dated old and smelly terrible beds we asked to be moved and the room was less smelly but equally bad on all other fronts tiny bathrooms just extremely disappointing all round air con heating didn t work just a fan blowing that couldnt be turned off ,0
 we had pre booked afternoons on tea this is supplied in miniature compared to previous locations we have been the vegetarian offering was cheese and pickle and tomato and pickle erg sandwiches clearly the chef lacked imagination this was qualified when we took our pre booked 3 course british menu dinner the following day the steak and kidney pudding was no more than a pie which looked like someone had popped out to the local supermarket which was served with salad the apple crumble cake was totally inedible as it was stewed apple heavy on the cinnamon and then wrapped in seriously in baked pastry please do not waste you re hard earned cash rating here there are loaded of great restaurants on the hotels door step so take a walk ,0
 overall stay was very good modern room and friendly staff good location close to lancaster tube,1
 i liked the location of the hotel in relation to king s cross station the staff at the hotel were friendly very helpful and very efficient particularly with regard to our dietary request for soya milk for breakfast i would recommend and plan on staying at this hotel in the near future ,1
 went for business drinks at the pine bar and saw couple of mice running across the floor it was noticed by the bar person too and it seemed this did not create an alert and is regular occurence disgusting ,0
 we had some concerns about the cleanness of the place when we saw a mouse passing through in the breakfast lounge in the morning while having breakfast not sure i will re book again on it,0
 the staff and space the staff asked us to rate the hotel in front of him and we missed our train because if the time he was taking ,0
 staff was unreliable room not as depicted on the website renovation works ongoing we were even offered a room in the middle of them in the first place not yet equipped with basic furniture e g no wardrobe smell of fresh paint access not yet paved and not suitable for 4 people as booked ,0
 extremely small room broken dresser broken chair tv fixed to wall where can t see,0
 location was fantastic just a 10minute walk from the national history v a and science museums and even close to the royal albert hall ,1
 reserved a 28sqm executive double room which would have been perfect site said kids welcome called in advance and was told that coming with two kids 8 and 5 was no problem on arrival manager said it would have been ok if the younger child was 2 or less and appeared to only want to make us pay more at all price felt disgusted and trapped and decided that if i had to pay more at least they won t benefit so we decided to split my wife and kids stayed and i booked a single room in a cheap hotel within walking distance talk about ruined vacation there are lots of other nice hotels in the area i know i ll avoid this one in the future ,0
 we where given a room by the lift and main door to all the other rooms we spent the whole night being woken up by people coming and going in and out of the lift at all hours when we complained the manager lied to my face and told me he had never had a complaint i then googled the hotel and found several complaints about that room and the hotel there was blood on the walls and dirt and grime in the bath room when we showed him he became angry are dismissive i would advise any one thinking about staying to not bother the rooms are small dirty and the manager is rude dishonest disrespectful the breakfast looked and tasted as if it had been there hours rated 4 not a chance is it i wouldn t even give it a 0 rating emailed the company s customer service team and was advised i would hear back within 24hours nothing from them at all ,0
 the staff were helpful especially the bellhops who seem to take on almost every role if we needed something it was taken care of within minutes the rooms were nice only qualm was they are really small we enjoyed the breakfast nothing too fancy but it was nice and also nice not to have to arrange getting our own our breakfast was included ,1
 the room was really completely sound proof we appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes and if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack the superior rooms are equipped with a bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable ,1
 the rooms is very very bad the one they gave us we have a 4 months baby we could not put for him a bed because it s too small we could not let him sleep in our bed because it s a queen size we let him sleep on the floor imagine ,0

 the hotel is not up to 4 stars standards the room provided by the staff doesn t exceed 16 sqm along with the bathroom which is more like a boutique standard not to mention the rate the property was way over priced the staff were very extremly rude arrogant and ignorant especially xavier gay tall guy with light moustache he should be working in a butcher shop instead he has zero knowledge about how to provide normal hospitality services to clients to be fair the property shouldn t be rates more than 1 star hotel this is the worst hotel i have ever visited and definitely the worst and most expensive holiday inn worth to mention that i am a good member of holiday inn chain ,0
 everything ,1
 we were transferred to the sister company paddington court literally down the road because of broken boiler but in return were given free breakfast during our stay the rooms were perfect and comfortable location was good near a station and staff were great ,1
 lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed we stayed in the split level room which we really liked if you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level the oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from you can get the metro close by 8min walk or the tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the hotel all in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central amsterdam we will be returning ,1
 lovely soft bed and the buffet breakfast in the restaurant the theatre bar also looked great but was not open when we where there ,1
 the location is perfect the staff warm friendly and accommodating the rooms are lovely with little surprises delivered daily by the staff high tea is a treat and the lobby bar is upscale and lively this is definitely my favorite uk property ,1
 very very small and crowded for 2 people,0
 i paid over 100 for a double room ended up with 2 singles pushed together with a room in which the tv didn t work for the whole stay l ,0

 loved that we we were allowed to check in early lovely clean and modern room and bathroom the staff followed through with their promise of a a very tasty and beautifully presented cake for my cousin who was celebrating her 40th birthday nice view of the thames very welcoming and helpful concierge staff great location if there for an event at the o2 ,1
 the staff were so friendly and very helpful ,1
 i went to the front desk to ask for slippers but did not give me check out,0
 the noise oh the noise on a quiet weekend i was put in a room above a courtyard with a party until 2am then staff dragging chairs and talking much longer reception too dark could not read forms to sign in check in was very slow after working non stop for 6 weeks i just wanted a decent sleep and though given the price and reviews this would be possible ,0
 perfect hotel excellent staff ,1
 the location was super an easy walk to covent garden 10 15 mins we were always able to get a taxi immediately at the front entrance and it is a two minute walk to russell street tube or a 10 minute walk to holborn ,1
 we didn t book breakfast but was told at check in we were guest of the day upgraded to executive room and free breakfast result rooms on 9th floor are good with decently coffee machine with pods hotel easy walk to olympia where we had a exhibition also easy walk to shepard bush ,1
 everything,1
 they didn t bother cleaning the dust on surfaces carpet floors or used glasses before my arrival if you require a simple plaster to stop bleeding from a small cut it may take more than half an hour and 7 telephone calls for the staff to deliver it as in my case it wasn t a quiet room even though i explicitly asked with regular train construction electric transformer unit noises the usual london hotel behaviour asking for deposit for everything from the room to the umbrella unsecured wifi small annoyances such as the elevator that makes you wait min 5 minutes each time high end room control gadgets that require daily reset which otherwise don t turn of the lights no sewing kit etc ,0

 staff were friendly and helpful from the minute we arrived the view from our room was incredible we were attending a concert and this was the ideal hotel for location when leaving the next day we were unsure how to get back to the station we cannot fault how helpful graham was with advising us to make the river bus he showed us on the map where to get off and was just generally a very nice helpful man thankyou for our amazing stay x,1
 the staff were very rude lack of communication the iron that was given to us exploded causing me to have an electric shock the breakfast facilities were not clear in orientation when arriving back late at night the night member of staff got frustrated at us for not pushing the correct door and was not at all hospitable due to the iron exploding we had a power outage for 20 minutes and although the power was turned back on after this time the sockets in the room either side of the bed were not this caused us to have not have charged phones and therefore we were unable to even take photos let alone post them on social media or even use our iphones for gps upon complaining the manager gave us a pathetic discount of 10 and offered us an upgrade this was despite us exclaiming as clearly as we could without swearing that we would not be staying there again in event ,0
 the location is excellent it s a very comfortable and beautiful hotel with affordable price near you can find russel square station from where you can go anywhere and it s just a short walk from stores and restaurants and the food there is excellent ,1

 the location is perfect and the room view is amazing ,1
 the bathroom and sofa are so good the building style is really awesome ,1
 it was a very nice hotel,1
 fantastic weekend with my partner we would definitely stay here again location was excellent and couldn t have asked for a better area to stay in was so close to the metro and all the shops bars and restaurants room was lovely and cosey and very modern with a classy edge to the facility ,1
 breakfast was good also location ,1
 very small rooms lightblubs out and bed not very comfy,0
 extremely poor hotel mamagement on every level our room had no windows or air con the extractor fan was very laud and the air quality was horrible and musty do not make the mistake at staying at this hotel still no compensation has been given after the manager agreeing with me at the time ,0
 the decor is odd the room service was delivered cold incorrect the room was dark the bathroom had an unpleasant odour the staff were disinterested having stayed there numerous times over 10 years this was really disappointing,0
 small room no door for bathroom less staff ,0
 bed dirty wet had to change rooms late at night made to feel we were inconveniencing staff,0
 stayed room only very convenient to cafes very comfy friendly n helpful staffs,1
 breakfast was amazing and staff friendly and helpful ,1
 everything,0
 the staff was supremely professional and courteous they offered to let me check in a bit early once the room was ready clarified and resolved a minor clerical error in the booking and made sure all was set for my partner who was arriving after me to pick up a key to the room the breakfast cost extra but was well worth it plenty of options for carnivores and vegetarians alike the hotel is conveniently located between heathrow and central london and has excellent public transport connections there are a number of pubs restaurants cafes and shops tesco boots etc nearby i would definitely stay here again ,1
 the room was very clean and had everything needed for a good relaxing sleep ,1
 room was way to small for the money i paid,0
 if was not clean at all bathroom lock was broken ripped carpet in bedroom smell throughout pool was awful reminded me of the terrible pools at school was not given a smoking room as requested 21 overnight parking heating did not work staff spoke little english worst stay ever,0
 reseption staff,0
 staff was very friendly and i would recommend that again,1
 i stayed in this hotel for a weekend away with my partner and some friends it was brilliant that they hold your bags for you before you can check in and when you check out this is a lovely hotel however we was given a single room the beds are nothing like the pictures we got given a single bed for two and they refused to do anything about it i had an awful nights sleep my two friends were transferred to the shaftesbury premier because of electrical faults in there room and that was much better than this one ,0
 value for money s the manager also left a personal welcome note for us in our room along with some little luxury items chocolates wine and soft drinks the children were delighted to have some goodies delivered room service too excellent start to our holiday ,1
 staff were very friendly and helpful nice little bar area just off reception bed very comfortable price excellent for this part of london ,1
 you couldn t open the window in room for fresh air it was too hot at night couldn t sleep due to this and no air conditioning only a fan which didn t do anything at one point it was 28 degrees c so uncomfortable worst night sleep ever the rooms were very tired furniture was scuffed and old when came to check in at 6pm there was a long queue and took nearly 30 minutes to check in stood in a queue it was not good when had a tiring day ,0
 the rooms were too small for the amount i paid per night then we were given a non smoking room but the foyer near the rooms was smelling of smoke all the time the concierge was very very unfriendly and rude no help at all for foreigners like us ,0
 ended up with a silly parking fine when i told the receptionist to take all payments in parking be careful if your going by car no clear signs,0
 hotel description and terms and conditions doesn t match with booking com,0
 friendly staff clean room comfortable bed,1
 room like a japanese pod hotel not worth the money ,0
 staff was great location was decent ,1
 out dated ,0
 this is without question one of london finest hotels i have never slept that well in a very very longtime and i love the duck amazing reception and great facilities ,1
 new decorated just enough space very clean ,1
 location free wifi clean and cosy room comfortable bed tasty breakfast,1
 this hotel is advertised as 4 star the room we booked was a standard room it was small the bed was small pillows uncomfortable no air con and the room was hot if the window was open the noise from the street was very loud problems with the plumbing very noisy,0
 comfortable beds central location,1
 the hotel has gone through a refurbishment and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza previously rooms were a good size and although a little tired were relatively comfortable now rooms have been made smaller presumably to increase number of rooms overall and are too small not even enough space to leave your suitcase somewhere without it getting in the way and overall feels claustraphobic windows dont open so you wake desperately needing fresh air beds are lumpy and it feels like you can feel the springs probably the worst designed bathroom i have ever seen shower tray is elevated and has a rim of about 3mm the shower heads are positioned so that you can barely stand behind the glass shower screen and the end result is that a lake is created on the bathroom floor and the spray from the water soaks everything from the bath mat to toilet tissue i had an issue with my bathroom whereby water was seeping under the walls and created pools in the bedroom carpet staff were very helpful in this instance but i had to change rooms and was upgraded to a club room which was a better size but same bathroom etc and mini bar was locked and inaccesible the hotel has also changed its wifi now no password needed but the connection is not a secure one this meant that my business laptop and applications would not permit me to connect same with some personal apps so as a business traveller it meant i couldnt work buffet breakfast is extremely expensive at nearly 18 pounds if you buy vouchers in advance you get 3 pounds discount but even then it is expensive and overpriced room rates very variable depending on which night stayed but range from around 155 to 285 pounds per night which is high it may be london but its not the west end nor the most glamorous of areas i beieve there is a pool in the basement but as a result the whole of reception area smell strongly of chlorine,0
 it was lovely great view over the river easy to get to tube will try more facilities next time,1
 every thing,0
 the hotel has really dated since the last time we went a few years ago from entering the car park which had old doors scrap bits of carpet and broken glass to the smell of damp in the rooms it s a real shame as to the condition it has turned too ,0
 good price and convenient location for the tube the hotel is next to hyde park so a nice walk through the park to either oxford street or harrods etc ,1
 great breakfast close to the tube great staff ,1
 excellent location right next door to metro chatelet station and easy walking distance to louvre notre dam,1
 the hotel is very close to waterloo station london eye shrek adventures sea life aquarium and other important points of interest we planned to visit ,1

 the staff were extremely helpful and cheerful from the moment we arrived and were helped with our luggage which was even taken to our room while we checked in ,1

 good powerful shower can t hear doors in the corridor ,1
 dirty ac didn t work properly shower head was broken so i had cold showers for a week my complaints were ignored they sent a woman with a new shower curtain in response to my problem with the shower i had 7 days of agony in this place i left with the flu and terrible asthma the last insult was paid wifi the free lobby wifi didn t work ,0
 the people that work there r very rude,0
 everyone was really helpful friendly the bed was amazing so comfortable ,1
 the staff from the hotel messed up the date of our stay and refused to refund the money,0
 good excellent staff very friendly and attentive food was good bad hair dryer barely worked kept tripping out air con didn t work error messages on turning on water for bath was tepid at very best mini bar fridge didn t work mini bar not even checked refilled on room clean not even water previous nights used glasses left in room after room clean tatty room with chipped tables wifi didn t work across multiple devices non black out curtains so light streams into the room early mornings towels for one person in the room even though it was booked for two no info shared on booking of dinner breakfast spas etc points of note rooftop bar only open from 5 30 cant have lunch time visit check in at 3 00pm personal visit was awful and would not consider staying again,0
 the hotel features and furniture,1
 highly overpriced for what it offers designer hotel but really not offering anything special breakfast was ok but given the price i would have expected much better the room was very small and the air conditioning did not work given outside was almost 30 degrees it resulted in a horrible experience ,0
 very disappointed with stay hotel room was very dirty and hotel overcrowded breakfast self service system is appalling would not stay again as other much better value for money hotels in london ,0
 excellent location clean rooms ,1
 excellent bedding mattress and pillows room large and very quiet in the upper floors as requested staff extremely service minded and helpful wonderful location we took the tube from st pancras int l to temple when arriving however we discovered afterwards that the double decker bus 23 stops a few meters from the hotel and goes to the strand trafalgar piccadilly oxford circus etc i e ideal for shopping theatres and activities it was also very easy to go back to st pancras walking north on fetter lane to holborn then taking bus 45 to king s cross next to st pancras int l ,1
 the manager was slightly overbearing seemed to airways be telling her very helpful staff how to do their jobs each time we were at the reception desk micro management syndrome ,0
 the staff ,1
 room very hot and then when i put air con very loud so you had to choose hot or noise when trying to sleep also bed and mattress i can say was the worst i have ever slept in i recently staying in a easyjet hotel and it was basic but i had good night sleep and room clean plus cost half what i paid here the duty manager very good and understanding but said he would make sure room would be as it should next time i stay ,0
 attentive and friendly staff excellent breakfast,1
 the interior design fittings,1
 friendly and attentive staff,1
 for 188 a night this hotel achieves the standard of a travel lodge at best the staff are not as well versed in english as you might expect and i found myself having to repeat myself several times to get them to understand simple things like i took two bottles of water out of the minibar i would not stay there again ,0
 no support from most of the stuff room small and they won t give you two connect rooms separated bath room from toilet parking expensive and sometimes no place to park all detailed in the 4 stars hotels are missing there are no amenities even a slippers not available etc ,0
 staff were great and helpful,1
 the location is close to the underground nice neighbourhood the receptionist was very friendly and helpful good value for money ,1
 location and staff,1
 it was so hot in our upper room we paid extra for a duplex that none of us could sleep up there the bathroom which was upstairs was like a sauna without any bath or shower turned on we complained several times but were not given another room or a discount we only used half of the room downstairs with a family of 4 sleeping together on a pullout couch bed since it was too hot to sleep upstairs one of my sons even slept on the floor it made our experience very uncomfortable and no one at the front desk cared i called many times stopped by asking for a room change so upset i was crying do not stay here if it s hot weather in paris because although they advertise air conditioning it does not work ,0
 the staff were haughty and rude which when one is paying 400 a night is really uncalled for please avoid this hotel if you have a choice it is really not worth the money and as stephanie who can look down her nose at you from about 100 feet was quick to inform me you pay extra for breakfast bend over ,0
 the room was nice shower was lovely ,1
 the bed was really comfy and everything was super clean and sparkly ,1
 the staff were very friendly and the location next to the o2 was awesome ,1
 room cramped and really knackered breakfast was very unappetising and dull have had better in what would be considered a poorer quality hotel definitely not worth the price and wont make that mistake again,0
 the additional payment for the swimming pool the old facilities ,0
 toilet didn t flush well bed was very stiff no air conditioning,0
 location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine especially one lady that was incapable of smiling i felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of paris is not very good ,0
 staff were very friendly and helpful,1
 manager asked me to email a photo of the front and the back of my credit card for fraud purposes as i had booked this hotel and paid for it as part of a xmas present for my brother and his girlfriend my brother was told he could stay in the room as he didn t have the card i had paid for the room on with him as it was my card all very confusing and worrying never heard of a policy like this before won t be staying here again also do not email your credit card details if asked to completely no right,0
 bed was very comfortable and the view from the room was unreal,1
 we were upgraded and it was fantastic,1
 everythinhg,0
 convenient location and friendly staff,1
 room very tired menus dirty and stained depressing outlook,0
 the staff are extremely friendly helpful there are nice extras in the room like robes with slippers a mini fridge the location is exceptional right in the heart of the latin quarter st germain des pres neighborhoods beds were very comfortable the air conditioning worked like a charm ,1
 very comfortable bed great views of big ben the eye on one side the shard on other from the room,1
 the service standard of front desk is poor ,0
 very fancy offered free pool use too,1

 great location rooms ,1
 great location for city or west end quick check in quiet room best hotel i have stayed in in london going back in febuary ,1

 the noise from train station for some rooms,0
 the staff were superb very helpful and friendly the hotel is in an excellent position close to the underground station and easy to get to the room was very clean and well serviced each day ,1
 fire alarm went off 5 times at six in the morning hygene wasen t great staff not very kind all windows were sealed shut,0
 nothing but an old room for almost 400 per night very rude staff,0
 the heat was unbearable and i couldn t sleep with the window open as it s directly on the road so too noisy,0
 location,1
 noise and dirt,0
 this is a tired hotel extremely noisy plumbing uncontrolled fan speed on air conditioning uncomfortable beds common area and room in need of refurbishment priced as a luxury venue don t be fooled ,0
 our room literally looked like a prison cell it was incredibly stark and furnished like a cheap office ,0
 best standard,1
 great location,1
 9 euro for a caf au lait is just not acceptable not even in paris ,0
 the dutty manger she is not helpful and she s only fahaiting with clients i feel i was in police station not in hotel also the internet its was very bad in the rooms with very noisy of working when i ask the dutty manger about the noisy she answered me this not our problem ,0
 lack of hot water in the bathroom at 10am sunday morning mess in the parking spots and not enough spaces to park,0
 the k k hotel is always maintained and staffed to a high standard we ve been going back there for many years now and always enjoy our stay ,1
 the staff have no customer service skills was put in a smoking room when asked to be placed in a non smoking we asked to be moved and was sent to the second floor where someone was bringing up the keys waited for 15 mins in gowns outside the room the resraunt was closed and was unable to eat i strongly urge you not to go to this establishment and i won t be using the company again,0
 1 carpet was very very old and needs to be changed 2 we were in the junior suite and the supplementary bed was like a youth hostel bed 3 the entire hotel seemed old and rickety and in need of updation 4 the paint was chipping off the walls 5 it felt like a 2 star hotel at best 6 hopefully we don t ever stay here again ,0
 staff are largely disinterested the room i had 004 was tiny at the back of the hotel and smelt of cannabis the room service was really bad a very limited menu of about 4 sandwiches which weren t all available the fresh soup was cold in the middle and the homemade crusty bread was two pieces of toasted sliced white bread not what you expect from a high quality hotel at all the first time i stayed here last year it was lovely though i didn t eat there then and there seems to be an overall decline in quality since then ,0
 the room was very small i had requested a room on upper floors and been given a room with no view on the ground flor amenities were really bad dove in this sort of packaging seriously ,0
 very small room not so clean no fridge unhelpfull staff at the reception hotel area you have to wait for chces in untill 2pm,0
 nevertheless there are number of things that can be improved and not all will have an impact on their profitability 1 internet in the room has to be paid most of the hotels include this in the daily rate and even if i paid once for the service i had several problem of connection actually money wasted 2 water in the room 1 or 2 500 ml bottles is a normal practice in good hotels 3 flexible breakfast arrangement allowing the guest to have a breakfast whenever she he wants is to me a better arrangement than obliging to commit all days of the reservation 4 the room service was not efficient and in 2 occasion i had to remind the reception of doing the room in one instance they forgot to do the room and then in the afternoon was too late i also asked twice to have the shampoo and shower gel in both occasion they forgot to supply the material 5 the telephone in the room is not designed to make national and international calls so basically this hotel is not good for business trip when conf call are needed 6 after 7 days having paid a fair amount i have asked for a late check in i had to pay gbp10 for each late hour although i got a gbp10 discount to be honest most of the hotels has given me this for free i have never paid a penny for a late check out 7 when in the hotel restaurants i had to pay straight away rather than paying the difference at the check out very disappointing to order coffee lunch and whatever else and be always with a credit card or cash to pay the balance immediately 8 breakfast not a good selection of food croissants and ham were really bad 9 to access the swimming pool and or the gym there is an entrance fee if i did not misunderstand again most other hotels offer this service for free 10 the bed was with thin mattress and during the night i could feel the springs jumping and making strange noise not very comfortable ,0
 the rooms were modern clean and comfy the bathroom a wet room very good shower ,1
 stayed in a family suite during half term perfect as the two areas meant we were separated from our kids by the bathroom great view of the county hall and london eye staff very friendly and welcoming location is just fantastic and the breakfast was fab too ,1
 the hotel was designed by the person who designed the titanic and the downstairs and architecture was incredibly grand the rooms and bathrooms were pretty small bernard the concierge was excellent ,1
 nice room well maintained yet still with character eco friendly products in the bathroom friendly staff ,1
 quiet and beautifully furnished,1
 my boyfriend and i wanted to spend a special christmas in london and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish london hotel the room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised it was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the 70 s or something the breakfast was 15 pounds per person which is ridiculous the staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare the bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks overall i was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel our room looked straight out of a motel 5 and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move this was not a supposedly a 4 star grand royale hotel i will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in london for the amount we paid we expected a lot more its not as advertised ,0
 stop the bloody constant alarm going off and oh my god let the potential customers know that there is construction happening at the hotel cant believe all the above compared to the expensive price at the same time diagraceful wifi as my 2g network would be far better than their silly snail like wifi disgraceful for them to also charge to use the swimming pool 3 10 rating ,0
 i did not want to come away two days before christmas with insect bites all over my toes and legs to top of thigh arms cheeks and neck the bedroom carpets also had insects which were biting on the feet and legs as we sat on the chair watching the views from our window ,0
 no sound proofing in rooms bring ear plugs to check in and out there s a massive queue at breakfast you re asked if you d like a tea or coffee then you ask for a cappuccino and they tell you you ll be charged the room was cold and there s no mini bar overall i would avoid this hotel ,0
 room so small that one cannot even sit around the coffee table properly,0
 a really nice hotel located close to barrio latino perfect to walk and eat the hotel it s really marvelous rooms nice and artistic the attention at reception perfect and really attentive and friendly and of course professional thanks so much for everything i ll come back for sure ,1
 fairly big room for paris and great location ,1
 lovely grand hotel staff very helpful ideal location the concierge and door boy were very friendly ask for a taxi and the door boy waves one down for you outside the hotel very clean and love the old victorian style a hotel with a lot of history would book again ,1
 location of the hotel was great cleanliness and style wad commendable ,1
 air conditioning did not work 88 90 degrees in the city do not get balcony rooms on low floors if you plan to sleep before midnight very loud interior room is fine overall i don t think this hotel is a good value for the price no amenities and rooms much smaller than other comparably priced hotels somehow the auto rating is giving the hotel a 4 2 which it is not ,0
 clean quiet and excellent location,1
 we had dinner in the indian restaurant on site and as we were finished a mouse ran across the restaurant floor there was also an ant in the teat coffee set up in the room ,0
 the hotel stay was overpriced the breakfast was budget in terms of the ingredients used and not alot was on offer definitely wasnt worth 13 50 the remote and phone in our room was dusty the hotel looks very plush on the hotside but not well maintained on the inside with the elevator smelling of cigarette also the parking 21 for 24 hours are they going to wash it too i would not stay again at all as i dont think i got value for money whatsover the gym is 4 a session too ,0
 everything else bedding the colour of chewing gum mattress wafer thing room extremely small no iron or ironing board in the room bathroom and shower tiny,0
 hotel is in a terrible state i was offered two rooms each with old cracked broken and dirty curtains furnature tiles and carpets woth horrible smell of imdustrial cleaning product one of the worst nights spent in a hotel i slept in my clothes i will never stay here again staff was lovely it is not their fault ,0
 comfortable room good free wifi room service,1
 everything ,0
 very helpful staff room spacious with 2 young children breakfast and room service food excellent located close to london eye,1
 very comfortable and great value,1
 hi this hotel is not 4 stars at all i booked two rooms both of the ac s are not working and the wether is hot in paris a asked the hotel at 7pm to do something about it and went out for a tour i came becouse its too hot to stay i came back at 11 45pm the rooms are still the same i went to the reception to ask for help they sent me the bell boy he checked and said i cant do any thing its not my job i think that this is not an answer for a guest i asked to change the rooms still they didnt do that after going down and up to the room several times still nothing was done after 45 minutes they got me a small portable ac for one of the rooms which didnt work properley and i had to install them not them i was up till 4 30 am cant sleep its tooo hot im paying for four star service im not paying for this service plus the night shift guy was saying in an un polite way i cant do any thing stay at the hot room till tomorrow the technician will come and till my check out nothing was done very bad hotel the rooms are not as the pictures the bath rooms handles were full of rust and the shower pipe was open i had to fix it not an advisable hotel be careful,0
 i could not spleep at all because of wrong fire alarm three times in a night well that could happen but the way how the staff in charge handled with it and treated the guests was simply unbelievable i thought i have enough experiences with incovinient situations at hotels but this hotel gave me a chance to enjoy a negative travel experience beyond my imagination ,0
 the quiet setting in the middle of a beautiful part of the city the feeling of being abroad with the lovely outside courtyard ,1
 great location and value for money stayed her for our anniversary visit to the big smoke when arrived discovered there was a bottle of wine in the room as well as petals on the bed which made our 25th anniversary even more special,1
 too expensive comparing to its breakfast and room condition ,0
 the service is not what you expect from a famous 5 star hotel as the staff were in general looking bored of manu customers they recieve per day tge shooking part was the room cleanliss where i found lots of dirts and bottels caps and toys just after pushing yhe bid little bit i asked for a king size and i got twin attached bids which they took one hour to reareange it moreover tge comfort of the matress is so bad even 2 hostals may offer better matresses wi fi was not strong enough i bearly catch a signal at tge bed corner ,0
 typical soulless central paris hotel,0
 this is no way a 4 star hotel rooms are very small carpets in hotel need to be replaced especially floor 5 very dirty no air con working bar had only i white or 1 red spanish wine no sparkling rose or other country very poor bathrooms no storage or shelf for toiletries large crack across our sink ,0
 rooms far too small climbing into bed wobbly sink tap and stink of drains coming up from sink give my proper switches rather than an uncharged ipad to work the lighting ,0
 good location,1
 the location the staff were excellent the hotel was very clean and comfortable ,1
 left some things in the room which housekeeping apparently didn t find or didn t submit to list n found keeps telling you to call back without a firm response ,0
 brilliant location staff were very helpful and the view from the room was excellent would definitely visit again and highly recommend ,1
 everything the hotel is in serious need of modernisation ,0
 very friendly staff and the room was nice and clean and big ,1
 great breakfast nice rooms handy to the metro ,1
 staff were friendly the hotel was very clean the hotel is in a good location and very easy to find overall it s a nice hotel but be aware of the very small bedrooms and bathroom ,1
 the facilties were excellient the breakfast buffet outstanding the staff were so helpful nothing was to much trouble well done to everyone,1
 super stylish hotel next to a lovely park close enough to the city centre but far enough if you get me ,1

 room was nothing like as advertised not even close to level of comfort luxury or space room also smelt no hot water generally not happy and staff had no solutions ended up moving hotels not worth the money just spend a little more and go to a nicer hotel ,0
 the reception staff were chewing gum as we checked in the room was booked as a club double room stating on your website a king size bed on arrival we we on the top floor of the hotel with the view blocked by a 1 2 wall outside our window the room was opposite a lift which could be heard in our room the bed was only 5 wide and wifi for our room was 10 extra the amount paid was 258 for one night which we consider very expensive for a disappointing experience was this because it was booked through booking com i m beginning to wonder ,0
 the hotel is a construction site noisy constant drilling and the management don t care simply put don t stay here ,0

 tatty over priced could do with a refit ,0
 everything it s amazing,1
 they place the two of us mother and daughter on the street level room we can hear footsteps outside cars and any noise at all 2 nights of bad sleep is it because we are chinese guests we paid a lot of money for the room breakfast is poor cleanliness and service bad we are frequent travellers and this is one of the worst hotel we stayed in avoid at all cost ,0

 the hotel more than met our requirements for our 1 night stay we had booked a deluxe triple deluxe double room for our family of 5 as it states in the blurb the rooms are described as compact and our double was just that but we did not find this an issue and found the room to be comfortable modern and clean the bathroom looked new with modern fittings a lovely shower with an adjustable wall mounted head rainfall overhead fitting we also had ample tea coffee supplies bottled water biscuits and a selection of fresh fruit the reception and public rooms have been tastefully restored and give the hotel real character all the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful finally the location is a real bonus as there are 2 tube stops within 2 minutes walk hyde park is just across the road and there are numerous bus stops however if you don t mind a walk then the west end is about 25 minutes way on foot we also had a lovely surprise when we checked in as instead of the triple room we had booked we had been upgraded to the lily langtry suite which made our stay that extra bit special ,1
 the room was closet size the carpet was stained the lampshades were missing the view was a building the decor was awful for 420 00 a night it was one of the worst places we have stayed and we have stayed in better motel 6 s or la quinta s the front staff was unhelpful the concierge was great take a pass on this under any circumstances ,0

 air condition,1
 never n again the mezzanine room was sub standard it was located in the building next door locks didn t operate well which was frustrating as we had to open 3 doors before getting into the room the heating could not be turned off on the hottest day of the year when we returned to the room at midnight discovered this at 2 am and tried to manage this situation instead of walking out of the building with my daughter complained in the morning prior to having the worst buffet breakfast we had to compete with the staff for food as they were clearing the table and licking their knives in glee they then pushed pass our table to go outside for cigarettes the smoke then wafted in whilst we finished our breakfast i have communicated with the manager who ignored my last phone call and communication as i asked for 50 of the cost to be refunded i thought this was fair as we had the most horrific nights sleep but he refused stating that they could have resolved the issue at 2 am let s start moving rooms sorting out the problem at 2 am hotels need to know that this is unaccepatable service i would not recommend this place to anyone it is a shabby place trying to look good ,0
 very clean simplistic and a huge welcome after a double booking elsewhere nothing was too much trouble when speking to the staff ,1
 good location in a lively part of paris very quiet streets with restaurants nearby reasonable size for the rooms which have been renovated and well maintained ,1
 staff are the best of everything they were their every time you need help thanks to everybody,1
 the restaurant service and food at the breakfast and when we had a late lunch were below average the room had no charm or character it smelled like mold there was the metro noise that was heard all the time the wifi coverage was bad and kept on getting cut the a c did not work and they had to send someone to fix it twice the carpets are ugly in stairs and corridors of the hotel the bathroom is really old and of cheap quality the hotel is large and impersonal it is a three star hotel in a building that once hosted a grand hotel no coffee in the room no extra amenities or personal touch ,0
 excellent location for hyde parke and central london beautiful building ,1
 bed was good no bath towels and it took a couple of phone calls to obtain some ,1

 a lovely magnificent old building and well kept hotel in the heart of london great staff great room a good bed and a nice breakfast i will return ,1
 unbearable heat and stuffiness that couldn t be turned off and the outside air conditioning units were right outside the bedroom window throwing heat and noise back into the room waiter was ignorant and ignored us at breakfast time and kept us waiting too long for coffee which was ordered when entering dinning room ended up not having any overall not a good experience and we will not be returning also an asian wedding reception on the first night so no where to park which was one of the reasons we chose this hotel,0

 we had to wait until 14 20 to check into our room 14 00 was advertised we were taken to a superior room no 109 my wife and i could not move around the bed without bumping into each other only one desk chair in the room asked to move room shown room 128 and this room was similar to the other but did have a sofa bed noisy broken springs completely worn out and caused us no sleep very uncomfortable and not fit for purpose bathroom no hot water in the sink silver fish on the floor wardrobe only four old hangers the worst hotel in london i have ever stayed in not recommended never again ,0
 the location was perfect for an event we were attending in hyde park the room was clean helpful staff who responded to my concern about the comfort of the room politely ,1
 this is the best hotel of shaftesbury group 7 min walk to paddington station ,1
 the staff were very friendly and the hotel had a relaxed atmosphere,1
 the room given was not the room booked the front office clerk was not helpful she told us to write and complain to the management if we are not happy about the room breakfast was a continental breakfast not the expected cooked english breakfast ,0
 location food staff service hotel amenities,1
 everythink,0
 we booked for a king bed room however a twin room with two single beds was provided an immediate change of room could not be provided without paying extra to upgrade the room the room has funny smell which was not pleasant the house keeping staff was kind and helpful who combined the two single beds together to make a double bed however the overall experience was disappointing given the price we paid ,0
 minimal rooms i found lower prices for the same room in a lower price and they don t respect his own best price guarantee air conditioner doesn t work room hot because swimming pool below bathroom tooooo small noisy subway running below i reserved standar double two days and i paid expensive double room for the next five days but they don t gave me nothing bigger advertise says chocolate wine bottle of wat and till now i didn t see nothing ahhh comfortable but small bed and full of old carpets thinking to call uk customers protection advice ,0
 the waste removal from corridors is very very poor calling assistance or room service is to no avail during the weekend the cut down staff too much i believe even queuing for the breakfast and waiting for the omelet takes too much time simply because there is only one chief ,0
 everything,1
 four star hotel but at the bottom of the scale it s all a bit tired carpets not vacuumed in the room communal areas dreary and staff had very poor communication skills 7 70 for two small bottles of water purchased at the bar i felt i was in a hotel in saudi arabia or riyadh would i stay here again no one young lady on reception was very good but that apart this hotel is not up to scratch ,0
 good size room nice and clean excellent breakfast great choice and great food ,1
 if you no that you are staying in 1 star hotel it ok you will not cara about any thing but if you are in 4 star hotel and its bad staff and hotel like this you have to really be mad and you can t meet thr maneger ,0
 the newly refurbished bedroom and shower room were great very comfy bed spacious room excellent shower would definitely stay here again great to have the spa facilities,1
 modern rooms great service nice convenient location,1
 walk in shower toiletries brand nespresso coffee complimentary drink at the bar buffet breakfast choices,1
 food was excellent staff were extremely professional and polite ,1
 the information staff were very rude and of little help to make a cup of tea there was no tea bags in the room and when asked i was given 2 tea bags plus 2 paper cups to drink out of for a high class hotel they really need to lift their game i definitely would not recommend this accommodation to anyone i was surprised that avalon cruises used this accommodation as they always have first class accommodation,0
 small room and toilet poor room service tissues and complementary water not refilled bed is small and uncomfortable old building and only renovated low value for money payment in your own country currency added additional 4 of charges ,0
 stains on carpets broken walls stairs so filthy only part that was clean was lobby,0
 receptionist very rude for a 4 star hotel i couldn t believe how she was speaking to us i ve had better service in a f1 tv so small and far from bed impossible to watch and hidden around a wall so completely impossible for one side of the bed to even see bed old and i was bitten by something 3 times in the night firedoor next to room and as the bed was on this side of room we were woken all night with people in the corridor aswell as metro passing underneath ,0
 the manager concierge i feel guilty that i forgot his name was outstanding and went out of his way to make the stay excellent,1
 the room was a club it was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height the bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room the mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth as a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere ,0
 rooms were not as expected in cleanliness or comfort ,0
 very overpriced for a hotel badly in need of a refit mould in the shower wallpaper peeling of the walls tv not tuned poor air conditioning and no free wifi its 2015 ,0
 i paid for club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit 2 suitcases in it additionally there was only a really narrow small window a friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell the room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay i am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our 4 day stay the carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had 2 different responses from 2 different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure ,0
 excellent location next to hyde park ,1
 our special requests were taken care of nice frontdesk staff stunning decorations there are two underground stations nearby and bus stations as well paddington station is just 15mins away on foot for taking a train to the windsor castle 20mins by underground to victoria station 5 mins walking to a street full of souvenir shops restaurants supermarkets metro stations post office telecommunications shops for sim card great location ,1
 check in took too long hotel is getting old and threadbare needs maintenance condensation from ac drips on you when in bathroom and leave puddle on floor loose wire socket by the bed carpet dusty bed so uncomfortable whichever way i turned spring would lodge in my side awful nights sleep before a very important meeting went to reception to speak to manager was stuck behind an equally annoyed couple already complaining didn t have time to wait to speak to him on the way back from breakfast having to step over dirty bedsheets just thrown from peoples rooms into the corridor bizarre probably the worst hotel i have stayed in ever shocking this is canary wharf hotel needs to wake up or drop its stars and become a hostel avoid ,0
 excellent location staff very friendly,1
 everything,0
 everything,0
 staff are rude rooms are awful location is awful hotel is awful much better hotels around then this,0
 room was 32 degrees when we got there set the air con to 16 but hardly worked and didn t reduce the temperature phoned and explained they said they would send someone up we were going out and expected something to be done and or communicated to us when we got back late that night room temperature was still a very hot and uncomfortable 27 degrees not good at all ,0
 it is a bit far from everything really big building with no pleasant atmosphere rather small rooms with very basic equipment the bathroom was small the toilet did not work properly and staff was not very helpful i came here because it was close to my meeting point ,0
 the worst stay in london the staff are incompetent the facilities are dirty i took a lot of pictures of blood on the side of the bath tub health and safety issues with cords hanging out of the tv definitely not worth the stay,0
 fantastic location and great telephone response pre visit,1
 the whole hotel is clearly tatty and slightly tacky the hallways the doors the woodwork in the rooms are that old dark brown stained bashed up wood used in seedy cheap b bs around the uk they have pipped an artificial sickly sweet air freshener via the air conditioning which makes a dreadful noise when on into the corridors and bedrooms truly nauseating if not a health hazard the shower bath very narrow and difficult to climb into for a shower and slippery had rusting taps and mould between the all the edging the towels and flannels were actually shredded the beds were so creaky you daren t move for waking people up and you could hear everything that was going on in the neighbouring rooms oh and finally if you are into all things brown this is the hotel for you not at all what we expected for a so called 4 star hotel shame on you ,0
 hotel staff lovely shower is amazing great location ,1
 the room allocated to me on the ground floor was previously a hallway the converted room was so small with a locked glass door to the garden the adjacent shower room was extremely tight there was a floor grip where attempts had been made to stick it down ehich in my view was a trip hazard the receptionist did not tell me breakfast isn t served after 9 00 therefore i missed it staff were not particularly concerned this had been sold by booking com as 4 ,0
 our second time staying in this hotel great location and breakfast close to metro station everything was great and we will definitely come back ,1
 the reception stuff was so bad ,0
 we were next to the swimming pool right next to it no window which made the room reeaallly hot we had to put the air con on in december we could hear people in the swimming pool forst thing in the morning the shower was also broken not a great start to the morning we also had to ring reception for extra towels as there was only 1 no remote control for the to either not impressed considering how much we paid ,0
 nothing nice,0
 i did not like the fact me and my husband paid 200 00 for a executive room which had been used by somebody else bed slept in and the room was dirty we was advised that room was clean we have pictures to tell otherwise it was disgusting i have a great deal of pictures to attache ,0
 the view,1

 clean room friendly staff ,1
 lack of cleaning dust and a sticky and unclean floor top up of tea milk and botteled water as promised did not work we had one bottle of water from wednesday til saturday beds were not done during two days and i had to clean the toilet myself a blue detergent was splashed out in toilet but not removed when i checked in at 16 pm the staircase was filled with dirty linen garbage and a very bad smell from suageproblems was dominating the whole staircase after reclaiming most of the problems were solved but it is not ok to use ones holiday on these matters we are not comming back to this hotel it was not a four star hotel at all just very simple all the way through and the price is a rip off 630 pounds for 5 days ,0
 the room the bed not comfortable not clean,0
 standard of room average very tired looking and not of four star quality attempted to connect to hotel wi fi without success toilet appeared to have unpleasant odour the shower bath was very slow to drain so that you would be up to your ankles in water when showering when checking in were advised that breakfast was not included it actually was and was confirmed by this website at the time of booking hotel relented once challenged but a regrettable start to our stay ,0
 room small and roof top var was closed we booked this hotel as the rooftop bar was a key feature,0
 when i booked online i requested a room with a view when i arrived i was offer a upgrade with breakfast inclueded my upgrade was over looking a building site great view wanted a lay in after a concert but 8am was woken by the noise so i shower with only 1 complementary shower gel to share between 2 went down for breakfast to be told i hadn t been upgraded and breakfast wasn t include wanted 17 50 for a breakfast disgraceful as with the cost of room smaller then expect for a superior double and with food and drinks at the bar i spent 275 reception wasn t helpful and i wont be returning anytime soon,0
 the staff were great room was brilliant and services in the room were perfect,1
 really nice location outside of the main tourist areas but good connections cosy bars and restaurants in the vicinity very nice receptionist who gave us good tips on where to eat ,1
 the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay and meal bar service were excellent our room was beautifully clean and comfortable with fantastic views ,1
 curtains sheers and curtain rods falling off the ceiling walls needed painting very badly carpets dirty bathroom tub and shower had black mold between tub and tiles the fact you had to pay for the internet and wifi and it didn t work most of the time would not consider this to be a 4 star hotel after staying in other 4 star hotels,0
 terrible and very rude staff ,0
 lovely helpful staff but room was small,1
 dusty small room carpet worn corridor bumpy floor lift doesn t install customers with confidence in its ability,0

 the staff were great and actually made my stay clean comfortable nice decor and good room service everything one needs for a two night stopover whilst working in town just bring some ear plugs if you are a very light sleeper ,1
 nothing at all this was the worst note i have stayed in it is no way near 4star not even a 2 at best air con didn t work on on repeat of the hottest days of the year so far windows didn t open fully to allow fresh air room size barely fitted bed duvet was dirty mattress stained bathroom unsatisfactory just a complete shambles ,0
 the hotel is not 4 stars fasciitis are below this standard breakfast is fair staff not co operative,0
 very bad value for money room was smelly terrible bathroom and uncomfortable sleep and all this for a rip off payment of more than gbp 450,0
 fab location very central lots of restaurants only around the corner staff very helpful ,1
 i messaged the hotel informing them it was my birthday and our engagement celebration the room we got was literally the smallest room i have ever seen we had to sleep with the window wide open as the aircon did not work and it was like sleeping in the dessert we didn t sleep a wink as it was such a busy street the bed was very short so my fianc s feet were hanging off the end of the bed he is only 6ft i had to request an iron as there wasn t one in the room and i had to sit on the bed as there wasn t enough to room for the iron and me to stand i saw the cleaner in another room which was twice the size so in sure there are bigger rooms we seem to have been given the smallest breakfast was horriffic it consisted of cheese boiled eggs cut in half a plate of bread which when i asked to have toasted it was warm and soft so seemed to have been microwaved lol and considering the reception is in a coffee shop it was the worst cup of filter coffee i have ever had ,0
 room size and style,1
 everything is bad in this hotel ,0

 good food with lots of variety ,1
 air con was broke so the room was like a sauna bleach stains on carpet bed was incredibly uncomfortable staff didn t seem bothered when we aired our concerns about the air con,0

 the room i visited the property with my husband and we couldnt sleep well the bed was too small you can barely say it is not a single bed the rooms need renovation also curtain in the bathrooms is unexceptable for a 4 star hotel in knightsbridge ,0
 the tv didn t work initially and the phone was not working an engineer came and i was awaiting for someone else to come and sort the phone nobody came so i rang reception again was told to go back to reception and i would be allocated another room the toilet in the room had also been used and the bathroom wasn t very clean generally i was also told at reception that i would be allocatedx a river view this wasn nt the case i changed rooms the 2nd room was improved but very tired and the bed was most uncomfy overall very disappointed and the staff weren t that helpful or friendly ,0

 we booked a room for two adults and a four years old child arrived and were told at the reception we had to book a different room because the law does not allow a child to sleep with us what the room was changed without additional charges but i suspect they chose the worst room in the hotel instead it was the first floor windows had bars and practically no light inside outside was a dirty place with lots of garbage bottles wrappings and cigarette butts tons of them we decided not to have a look thru the windows as we were not going to stay in the hotel all time but after the first night we left it was really bad experience seemed the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable then we waked up because of a smell of food it s likely some kitchen were under the room never again ,0

 every thing,0
 we stayed for two nights for the prudential 100 bike ride and had our bicycles with us previous hotels in which we have stayed have allowed our bicycles into our hotel room bearing i mind bicycles are worth several thousand pounds but we were refused they arranged for a porter to carry our bikes to a secure room but in the process the porter managed to bounce it off several things steps wall with the potential of damaging it although our room was supposedly cleaned after our first night half empty coffee cups were not removed and replaced with clean cups on calling housekeeping they did not send someone within a reasonable timeframe so we went to bed only to be aroused by someone knocking on our door which we assume was housekeeping as it was very late we didn t open the door we were also very sleepy having been woken up only to be woken by the telephone ringing on a couple of occasions as this was shortly afterwards we assume this was housekeeping we couldn t work out how to answer the phone in the dark as it was more than lifting the handset the hotel took my track pump in for safekeeping whilst we were participating in the ride and then couldn t find it when we were ready to leave no one was particularly worried about trying to sort out our issues again in a timely manner the porter eventually found it after approx 20 minutes having confessed that he didn t look properly in his cubby hole in the first place that combined with 35 00 for two gins and one tonic was the end of a bad stay ,0
 lack of trained staff horrible room and dirty ,0
 everything about stay was excellent staff accommodation location and overall facilities first class we ve now found a base for our visits to london ,1
 great location friendly staff,1
 room very poor very hot and probably the worst room in hotel at a guess because of discount booking web site bed uncomfortable felt like springs gone left back sore by morning air conditioning not working in a room that needed it to be place looking tired inside price does not reflect value for money far better off staying in travel lodge consistency basic but works value for money ,0
 the pillows the bed the bathroom was very clean iron and ironing board really big help,1
 i was moved on arrival despite only booking that day apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in the hotel i moved to was further away from where i needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere i d have chosen to stay overpriced and dissatisfied ,0

 terrible room was not accurate to how the photos looked at all the room was tiny the floor was dirty and the room was so overused and old i could not believe how much we paid for such a horrible looking badly kept room ,0
 my money was stolen in my room 1530 and i am 100 sure it s was taken by one or some of the staff ,0
 location was ideal for our purposes ,1
 amazing location incredible staff ,1
 small room could not upgrade when checking in despite being promised over the phone that it would be possible bad quality bed kept moving and the head board fell off the air conditioning unit was too loud and kept waking us up,0
 too expensive no service for a 4 star hotel stayed over the weekend and no one cleaned the room tidied the bed in 2 days had my sign make up the room hanged when i left in the morning came back at 15 30 and no one had done the room they knocked on my door at 17 asking if they could do the turndown i said i would be out in 15mn was just out of the shower and the maid said she should have been gone already she was working overtime like insisting on not doing my room i wished her good day and good luck and finished getting ready when i left after 10mn of course no one came to do the room 4 star hotel they call it unacceptable ,0
 ideal location just a stones through from waterloo station clean rooms beautiful bathroom kettle fridge sink which was handy and iron ironing board in the room which was nice two tv s was a nice touch so that people in both parts of the room could watch tv comfortable bed too ,1
 all everything were terrible from the extremely poor standard of the front desk reception at the time of the check in to the elevator smell room stinky smell unfriendly staff etc ,0
 lovely room very comfortable bed,1
 the penthouse fantastic views ,1
 comfort beds and location,1
 noisy area of town very tired hotel and smelt musty ,0
 hotel changed from the one booked meant a much longer walk to the nearest tube station i cannot accept that it was not known earlier that work was underway at the booked site ,0
 room too small very noisy,0
 staff can t speak or understand english there was a power cut for over 4 hours room gets very hot not fan or air condition,0
 the rooms are very clean and your check out could be delayed till 2 30 pm also nearby lot of restaurants and coffee shops ,1
 front office supervisor response to my needs was bad ,0
 hotel was great nice public areas and bar and they have us an upgrade which was nice of them really good selection at breakfast ,1
 none of the spa facilities were working when we stayed here extremely disappointing as this was the main reason why we stayed her in the first place they weren t particularly understanding or helpful ,0
 bathroom and the room was realy dirty and when we are complain on that the lady told the cleaner will comin but never happened ,0
 the booking confirmation showed that room had air conditioning and a laptop safe safe deposit box it had neither unless you count a pedestal fan that sounds like an apache taking off as air conditioning and the safe was present but had no power looked like it had been broken into and was not affixed to anything all this was compounded by it being the hottest day of the year and the room displaying a sign that we leave our possession in the room at our own risk the cleanliness and quality of the rooms is nothing like the pictures the staircases are a hazard as individual steps are sinking and have not been repaired the beds are not remotely comfortable there are no satellite channels available on the tv as advertised and the cooked breakfast was disgusting grease fest stick to the cereal i only booked the place to be near euston station but i ve rated location here based entirely on a tourism perspective there is nothing noteworthy nearby if you don t need to be in this area don t be ,0
 customer service,0
 it so expensive compare to other hotel in the same level,0
 best place warm stuff very helping clean with excellent location breakfast is superb wont think twice for re booking quiet locating,1
 the staff were extremely helpful and paul in particular was always lovely to us ,1
 add 20 euro for a young kid there are two sex shops on the street room has a bad smell the elevator and aisle are really narrow and the wall was painted in pink makes the whole place like a love hotel there is no lobby at all have no idea why this is rated as a four stars hotel to be honest any 3 stars airport hotel is far better than the place ,0
 location attitude of staff cleanliness,0
 very elegant,1
 everything is all i need to say have stayed there twice now and always has what i need great in that it has own entrance to the 02 and for the concerts its so good ,1
 bar,1
 location very good as tube station a very short walk away the underground car park was a plus point the price was acceptable as a guest this considering london car parking charges in general ,1
 the breakfast area was very small table were to close together it was like you were sitting on top of each other our room was very small couldn t open the door fully as bed was in the way also we had two single mattress instead of a double mattress overall very disappointed and wouldn t go back ,0
 good location fair price,1
 the room was booked on a deals website but it wasn t a good deal at all the en suite was not arranged in a suitable manner there was a loud vent right outside the window and the bathroom rattled from the vent the bathroom was muggy and the room allowed very little daylight into the room ,0
 good view smart room and very clean,1
 perfect location close to earl s court underground safe environment quiet environment great service efficient and pleasant staff ,1

 very nice location good service and value for money brill hotel would recommend ,1
 it is very dirty old noisy we can t sleep as there noise every early morning and last day there was leaking from upstairs toilet and the water was everywhere in the room beside no left to some rooms with very very tiny stairs shower is very small can t turn in it and dirty we don t use it ,0
 the room was absolutely tiny i asked for my room to be changed 3 times as each time they kept putting me in a room with a noisey ventilation shaft the second room had the shaft and a smell of sewage i had seen other reviews online but assumed they d had bad luck with the room no apparently a good proportion of the rooms face the ventilation shaft and pretty much all rooms are tiny by the third room i had given up the view was okay except for the sanitary product sitting on the window sill outside the room was so small though that i couldn t open the wardrobe door for the bed the room was actually the length of the bed and so you could only get in one side this is definitely not a 4 star hotel trust me the reviews are spot on the photographs on the hotel site are not ,0
 a lot on walking distance if you re a walker otherwise two underground stations within 2 minutes walk ,1
 the first room was very disappointing with rust in the bath and it was dirty all round so me and my partner moved to a second room and that also had rust in the bath very disappointing trip ,0
 one of the two beds was comfy nice view ,1
 the bed made a crinkley noise everytime we moved the fire alarm was malfunctioning 3 4 nights we stayed and went off at ungodly hours of the early morning the lady at the desk asked if we wanted a twin room even though we fooled a double our free breakfast on out last day we only received because we complained about the fire alarm was cold on our first night there were noises all night from out upstairs neighbor the free wifi was crap we were only given 3 passwords for 4 days that only allowed 1 device turndown service never made the bed i found garbage in the room that was not from us including a condom wrapper we will definitely come back to london but we will meet again stay at the beat western maitrise hotel ,0
 the room was perfect on the10th floor with great views of the london eye and big ben the bed was really really comfortable and the room very quite great location for walking to to sights and especially south bank ,1
 the location was very central with good restaurants within walking distance and lots of tube stations nearby ,1
 front office is not helpful at all pretend to be busy all the time which actually they are not very rude and sarcastic when ring to them for an urgent help can just hang up the phone by telling busy been to many countries and stayed in many other chain hotels but this is the worst experience i have ever had will definitely discourage anyone from staying here ,0
 i informed the hotel that we were staying for our anniversary when asking for a good view from the room and we were upgraded to a balcony with a wonderful view of london staff were friendly and even put our bags in the room ready for when we arrived back at the hotel later in the day ,1
 it was a wonferfull stay,1

 very comfortable rooms great breakfast selection,1
 the reception staff were particularly helpful the rooms were extremely clean and well equipped the beds were very comfy we enjoyed the breakfast very much ,1
 location superb as the underground was so near making travel excellent ,1
 recent remodeling in the room clean and new bathroom with decent amenities the hotel has maintained the public areas with the original decor adds character and a little bit of history ,1
 overall it s perfect nice location and facility the staff was very nice and helpful definitely will come back for our next trip in paris ,1
 very low quality for a 4 star hotel and the price inadequate response of the staff to the problem with running water in the toilet that has been very disturbing without my knowledge they charged my credit card that i gave for the reservation before i checked out probably to avoid paying compensation for the toilet problem ,0
 nice compact double room with good comfortable bed ,1
 room 213 the door to the room didn t open as it hit the bed toilet was dirty pigeons nesting on the window ledge which was covered in bird poo and very noisy noise from pipes in room as other people showed in other rooms was unbearable when i phoned to ask to move room due to the noise of the pipes reception told me it was likely due to people taking showers and then hung up on me i heard other guests complaining about their rooms to management at breakfast ,0
 room was nice and spacious,1
 reception staff were not welcoming and on other occasions when we were at reception they preferred chatting in the back office room was very tired bathroom dated walls thin ,0
 the club room is very poor and the breakfast was not acceptable croissants not cooked properly very little to no fresh fruit and tired looking cold meats additionally the club room is just about the dingiest i was ever in in a 4 star hotel it needs to be closed down and re decorated as it appears to be dirty carpets and chair coverings need to be replaced on the saturday 18th it appeared that whoever was cleaning our room was called away mid clean and didn t bother to return on 2 occasions we had to ask for dirty glasses to be removed and replaced with clean glasses ,0
 location is walking distance to olympia plus has an underground car park ,1
 the room was unbeliveably small there was nowhere to move they served me gone off milk and when i requested to speak to the manager repeatedly told no one was on was actually also told that it was soya milk and that normally curds i offered them to try the milk which clearly they refused ,0
 the alternative accommodation was sorted fast,1

 location right by covent garden and all the shops,1
 clean great room ground floor and bright,1
 unfortunately one of the receptionists was terrible instead of checking the system or asking reservation dividion she just asked me to make all the payment again even though i booked the room with the payment already it gave me negative impression on hotel and the city ,0

 location hi spec rooms,1
 room was small and the bathroom even smaller the photos of the rooms were obviously taken by a wide angle lens to make them look bigger than they actually were i have stayed in lots of hotels when working away and this has to be the worse one yet i was very disappointed because i had arranged this as a surprise weekend away for my wife and i we spent as much time out of the hotel as possible when we arrived on the 22 01 15 we were put in a room where when you opened the door to the room it hit the wardrobe and the toilet door would only open half way before it hit the bed and this was supposed to be a deluxe double needless to say i will not be staying in the shaftsbury premier in paddington again as for value for money it wasn t ,0
 everything,0
 i didn t like the way staff deal with guests bla khas reception in the hotel and normalize breakfast in the hotel restaurant dealings blunt expressly asked me not to reserve again through booking com and we give you the biggest and best room but if booked through them will get a smaller room without any features ,0
 the breakfast was the hit very nice and worthwhile and the italian restaurant is worth a try the beds and room we very comfortable and had a lot of space in for two people room no 723 we slept very well no noise from outside traffic very pleasant place to stay with family and tube station very close very helpfull and friendly staff ,1
 price,0

 breakfast river view from bedroom bar and restaurant location to 02 arena bedroom and bathroom ,1
 the beds were extremely comfortable and the room spacious and well appointed the only meal we had was breakfast which was excellent we were going to the o2 and the best thing was the hotel location effectively you didn t have to go outside to go from one building to the other we will definitely use the hotel again in these circumstances ,1
 no car parking breakfast cannot be recommended they are not able to make a coffee that they have to present a starbucks coffee for you their own coffee is warm brown water i wanted privacy but they disturbed me 4 times after that the staff needed a torch to made the air condition setting the extraction fan did not work overall no 5 star hotel,0
 tiny rooms fine they are compact but taller than 5 foot 10 and the bed will be too small room 216 huge industrial extractor fan right outside the window do not expect sleep ,0
 wonderful room gorgeous bathroom amazingly comfy bed ,1
 they did not commit with my request stated clearly in my reservation through booking the need of extra bed where they charged me more for the extra bed this validate my request and disturbed my budget ,0

 great location friendly staff,1
 location and facilities were good and reasonable for price breakfast was of good quality and selection on offer was good ,1
 we were upgraded god only knows what our room would have been like the rooms are tired and furniture tatty very little comfort given today s hotel standards ridiculously expensive we may as well have booked a premier inn for the amount we paid 180 for one night i d have expected breakfast there are way better and more reasonable hotels in london ,0
 this was the second time we have stayed there very friendly staff room comforts nearby to everything we visited beautiful hotel very clean on our second visit we were upgraded it was a very pleasant surprise and loved the room and view spectacular thank you ,1
 good location easy transport from and to airport,1
 location and good service and breakfast,1
 the car park was advertised as open it was closed they did not advertise that you had to pay for the gym i have never heard of that before in a hotel the lifts did not work and they did not put up a sign saying so we were put on the smoking floor they serve terrible wine at the bar the place is under refurbishment and needs it the whole place needs it ,0
 me and my girlfriend had booked a night at the hotel from the 24th to the 25th of june on arrival just like every other hotel i have stayed at we paid for the room and they add the deposit charge which we were told the deposit is just a holding charge and will refunded back this is completely normal just like every other hotel i have stayed in we were kindly upgraded foc to a master sweet which of course we were very grateful for on departure the following day they requested a second payment for the cost of the room after explaining to the clueless front desk several times i had paid for the room on arrival they were still adamant we need to make a second payment and that the cost of the room and the deposit are just holding charges never heard of this before and nor does it make sense seeing as they have taken the money already on the first day just to refund it back and then pay again great logic there unfortunately i did not have a receipt as we were not provided with one i should have requested one but i did not assume i would need to prove my innocence to them that i have paid already as it would show on their system which they checked and apparently no payment was showing annoyingly barclays bank were undergoing some maintenance so i had no way of accessing my accounts via app or online to show the payment i had made on the 24th the staff were very patronising and made me and my girlfriend feel cheap as if we were trying to get away with not paying in the end we had to pay again as we were holding up their que as i couldn t access my bank to transfer further funds to my account so my girlfriend had to make the second payment this was meant to be a treat for her from myself following a promotion at her work i ve never felt so embarrassed i left feeling very bitter and robbed ,0
 perfect location near westminster bridge waterloo mainline and tube stations and 5 minutes to south bank promenade and the london eye close to all sights and facilities we stayed for 8 nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the shard also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave clean comfortable and great for an extended stay great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers on site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants ,1
 1 star is more than enough for this hotel we arrived me and my husband around 1am and hadnt be late we were to leave to another hotel the second we opened the door it stank of mold and dirt room 103 hadnt been cleaned for decades everything stank even the bed sheets there were fliplops on the floor from previous guest and floor was covered with white bits the biggest surprise was the filthy bathroom where there was urine spots on the stool floor dirty and shower all stained we ended up sitting the rest of the night we couldnt touch anything didnt even take our shoes off simply disgusting ,0
 cleanliness was a problem shofar bed linen was not clean door handle was broken hair on the pillow bathroom floor needed to be scrubbed,0
 close to shops and 2 tube stations,1
 loved the size of the room the huge balcony was amazing with seating and across from the park size of the bathroom was nice too ,1
 room wasn t ready at check in room showed clear signs of wear tear staff were rude and helpful breakfast too almost an hour to arrive was a disaster from start to finish,0
 the room was too small it was not proportional to what we have seen in the website ,0
 very friendly staff beautiful hotel ,1
 noisy guests rubbish security,0
 was not expecting such a large room for the price we paid the room was amazing and views were excellent the location was superb and prevented extra long ques to get in to the o2 we will be booking again very soon ,1
 no airconditioning in the room a fan making noise all the night the worst experience in my life breakfast place underground food no good very noisy my room on the road didnt sleep the night and in the morning at 5 00 am franc prix store start bringing his product with all noisy fortcliff it is less than 2 stars hotel ,0
 the hotel the zone was not clean the service is poor the restaurant is very bad the hotel is ridiculously small to being a 4 stars hotel it does not even deserve 2 stars ,0
 the room was too noisy tv doesn t work and the shaving machine power point also didn t but they fixe it later,0
 i didn t like the unfriendly staff that do not offer help to any of obstacles you face during your stay i couldn t even get room service to mix banana and milk for my baby i m hugely disappointed,0
 the room is very very small the room was not cleaned daily so far from the stations tube and bus it s for sure not a 4 stars hotel as it s part of a residence building ,0
 the staff went the extra mile for us couldn t knock the service ,1
 the staff was disrespectful in the room there was not even a slipper or toothbrush and when we wanted them they didn t give them you have to pay extra for breakfast and there is a lack of options for breakfast ,0
 cold and dated,0
 amazing location staff were friendly room was lovely and breakfast is amazing just booked again ,1
 i booked through booking and i thought what i will get is exactly like the picture i saw online unfortunately the room was super old and smelly and the carpet was dirty when i asked they told me the hotel is under renovation and some rooms are already renovated and the ones i was checked in are the old ones i will never trust the picture put on booking it is misleading and unfair ,0
 the views over the river were fantastic staff were very helpful and were always ready to help it s one of the best hotels i have stayed in the next time we come to london it s the hotel we would book ,1
 everything including service,1
 location,1
 i liked the hotel was so close to the tube station and it was close to central london the bus links were very good,1
 i love this place the only hotel i have found in this part of london where i am treated as an individual amazing friendly service you feel you could ask what you want and the staff would try and help,1
 location,1
 clean friendly not far from kings cross,1
 no bathrobe and no sleepers shoes and when i asked for one they charged me 5 pound the distance between the hotel and the underground station is approximately 10 minutes walk ,0

 staff very helpful as i requested a view of the london eye for my family beautiful view very pleased,1
 stayed friday and what a disaster no parking left had to park in travelodge which apparently was much cheaper check in fine shower was covered in grime bed was most uncomfortable as were the pillows had been bitten by god knows what on my arms and legs paid an extra 36 for breakfast that was absolutely awful the eggs were under cooked myself and my husband have been unwell since saturday evening only now getting over the sickness so glad my nephew opted for cereal shall be making a phone call later to complain and ask for the 180 pounds i ve paid just to be left tired bitten hungry and sick as when i went to complain at check out there was nobody to be seen ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the curtains were black out which made it easy to sleep in good that breakfast was until 11am the staff were very friendly and they even gave us a little birthday cake for my husbands birthday to the room very thoughtful ,1
 no sink in the toilet the lift which requires your throne to use it no on site entertainment,0
 location was perfect for everything queensway tube is really close and the central line takes you anywhere you need to go the hotel is a very short walk to kensington palace gardens and hyde park room was clean staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 locatin,1
 breakfast was cold had to ask for toast as nobidy came to our table by the time it came we had ate our food bar was exspensive and staff advised us to order out and we could eat it in the bar bar area was over run by screaming kids from the private function i would not say this was 4 star dirty cups and glasses in the room and not much of a view see photo s ,0
 fantastic location we were going to the 02 for a show and it was so convenient loads of restaurants close to underground station hotel was perfect upgraded to a room with a view as it was our anniversary guest relations provided desserts delivered to our room beds were so comfortable highly recommended we will be back ,1
 expensive wifi rooms looking tired cheap bedding and pillows,0
 we reserved a baronne room with breakfast for two nights for 368 euro but unfortunately without explanation from the staff the hotel withdrew 453 92euro ,0
 hotel with character ,1
 it s an amazing historic building only good energies and the staff was sooo delightfully helpful ,1
 fabulous hotel family room was spacious and comfortable from start to finish this hotel ticked all the boxes location was fantastic too ,1

 rooms are bad,0
 very friendly staff,1

 being next to the 02,1
 firstly the breakfast service was really poor rude staff ordered eggs didn t arrive until an hour later second morning ordered a vegetarian breakfast did not arrive we had christmas dinner for 12 really small portions for 75 per head and our starter bruschetta was full of salt not tasty at all we paid over 800 for a christmas meal which was awful will never be returning to yourselves,0
 very near the tube so travel good ,1
 quality of staff food and location ,1
 clean spacious,1
 the room was not of a standard advertised very small with double bed pushed up against the wall desk adjoining the bottom of the bed therefore sleeping on left hand side of the bed blocked in on three sides very disappointed that this was described as a four star room was set up as a single and really should be classified as a single,0
 quite disgusted to find the bathroom full of mold in a hotel ranked as a 4 stars hotel,0
 tiny rooms old building go somewhere else,0
 rooms very dingy and old fashioned breakfast average staff miserable very unhelpful in reception and don t know the basics of the area would not stay again as in modern day hotels it is not up to general standards beds hard as rocks,0
 rude and unprofessional staff dirty room poor breakfast,0
 very central location convenient ,1
 efficient service bit of an issue with the 1st room as it was not tidy but immediately a better room was given it was actionec quickly ,1
 location staff was very nice and helpful bar was nice but wished they had a restaurant beyond breakfast,1
 having stayed here a couple of times before i was beyond disappointed this time around the location is ideal and there is parking and leisure facilities however upon check in we were given the keys to someone else s room thankfully no one was in the room when we opened the door we then went back to reception and were given a new room there were stains all over the carpet of the new room only 3 tv channels worked the extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work the seals on the windows were broken so the condensation meant you couldn t even see the spectacular views of the city which is factored into the room price we weren t offered any hot drinks at breakfast on both mornings of our stay we had to try and find a waiter who would respond or made the mistake of making eye contact with us otherwise they were all doing their best to ignore us and try to get on with what they were doing eventually when we did get someone s attention they brought a fabulous latte and a cold flask of hot water for a cup of tea with no milk we then had to find a jug of milk ourselves as the waiters yet again disappeared it might have been quicker to go milk a cow we resorted to taking one from another table the changing rooms in the leisure faculties left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness i walked into the changing room with my two year old daughter to be met with a mound of dirty used towels i would have estimated perhaps 80 or so my daughter was more than thrilled at the sight of towel mountain but i on the other hand wasn t the humidity and stench wasn t a good combination further upon getting into the pool the floor of it appeared to have sand all over it free foot exfoliation i would expect that at a beach resort but not an indoor pool all in all not the best experience at a hilton by far and i ve stayed in many worldwide very disappointed ,0
 spacious suite and ample bath swift repair of faulty tv excellent breakfast,1
 friendly staff,1
 view the amount of usb ports sockets by the bed,1
 fantastic food,1
 great location the metro station is right in front of the hotel quadruple suite is nice cozy clean and come with all amenities good wifi ,1
 worst hotel inhabited it everything is bad ,0
 check in was good very helpful staff and upgraded to a study room meal in the italian restaurant was good and staff very friendly,1
 attention to detail was spot on specifically things like toiletries which included items such nail files tooth brush and tooth paste rarely seen quality shampoo etc everything to make you feel comfortable extra large bed and soft duvet covers ensured i had a very comfortable sleep view of the river and o2 was impressive location to the o2 couldn t have been better literally a 2 minute walk once you get out of the lift lots of bars and restaurants ,1
 the outside courtyard,1
 staff were amazing and attentive from the moment i arrived at reception desk the guy at reception was checking 3 separate groups in at once so nobody had to wait got me a room with a bath as i asked for gave me late check out the next day i have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world for alot more money and the service here was one of the best i have ever experienced ,1
 room was much too small for two ,0
 staffs attitudeto peoblems,0
 we were asked to move rooms twice it was difdicult as we were staying with a toddler and elderly parents they took extra money from us and it took so many calls to get our money back the staff at reception dint know many things,0
 excellent if attending events at theo2,1
 nothing,0
 v comfy bed close to hammersmith station,1
 the beds were pretty uncomfortable and the pool too crowded with children the breakfast was ok the only thumbs up is for the location the stars are calculated and not given by me max 2,0
 i booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it the room was tiny literally the smallest box room i have ever stayed in the bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided the shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet there were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult i resorted to using the tv to see my reflection as i blow dryed my hair the room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened altogether an awful experience and i will not be staying there again the pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got very very disappointing ,0
 excellent hotel definitely coming back ,1
 good location spectacular views bus literally in front of the hotel backs onto waterloo station superior rooms are very spacious good hardware like huge tv flexible and helpful staff beautiful materials ,1
 not value for money rooms are very small and they charged 8 pounds per day extra for internet as internet is not free ,0
 room was lovely and compact rooms a good size ,1
 i never usually bother to write reviews however i had such a bad experience i have decided to make an exception this hotel if it can be called that is responsible for without doubt the worst nights sleep that i have ever had having spent 12 years in the army i m not exactly a princess about where i sleep either the bed was terrible sleeping on the pavement outside would of been more comfortable i have never felt a bed so hard my back still hurts now an its two days later the shower was also terrible with only luke warm water breakfast is served from 0730 which is no good when you have to be somewhere early when it is being served its horrendous hardly any selection stale tasteless croissants served with bitter coffee also the reception is not manned between 2300 0730hrs so if you do need anything you can t get it anyway i would never stay here again i have no idea how this place has had good reviews poor poor standards ,0
 evry thing of this place i can t name horlrel to this place was wrong and out of repair all lamp were nt work 2nights i got cold in cold room ac not working i so sorry for my self that i had to spend my time in this ruin place 4star hotel has nt refrigerator ,0
 location the quality of breakfast,1
 i had a room without a window this what like a prison ,0
 comfortable bed we were booked into the park grand paddington however transferred to the nearby park grand paddington gate we were offered complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience the hairdryer was promptly replaced when asked as the one in the room wasnt working properly ,1
 my room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building the room i was given was enormous and very comfortable i wish i had been staying for a week not just one night ,1
 best overall hotel from our three week trip around europe ,1
 bar breakfast we had to wait 40mn in the queue cool system flowing on the ground family room too small tv couldn t be seen totally from the bed i will never recommend,0
 excellent staff teams,1
 staff quite rude and unhelpful ripped me off on a second night stay booked the first night on booking then needed to extend another night and seriously increased the price then i was sat in the lobby area and overheard somebody walk in and book there and then much cheaper complained about this and they said they couldn t do anything as the rate fluctuates not a good way to make somebody want to come again rooms a bit on the small size,0
 price of 270 per night for a tiny room was not comparable with other local 4 hotels,0
 the bed was super comfy kitchen fab and room was quiet the reception staff were great with our children and very helpful ,1
 when we arrived very late after our flight we just wanted to shower but there were no toiletries in our room not even hand soap we had to call the desk and wait for a while before they were brought to us and nobody said sorry about that then our wash basin sink had a very bad drainage problem so it took so long to drain and was very inconvenient also a couple of towels had black spots on them ,0
 fantastic location phenomenal staff gorgeous room it was a very luxurious stay i almost didn t want to leave the room i walked everywhere the hotel is in the middle of it all ,1
 very poor repair and law conditions,0
 good location staff welcoming friendly professional ,1
 beds were extremely comfortable and room was immaculately clean check in staff were excellent ,1
 no hvac too noisy old small cramped falling apart worst hotel in a long time ,0
 hotel room is old and dirty staff was not friendly the wifi password did not work and the staff acted like i did it wrong turns out the wifi password expired and they didn t even say sorry ,0
 the breakfast,1
 friendly staff great location good size room clean lovely comfy bed good facilities and a great bloody mary in the cocktail bar ,1
 our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day not very comfortable and not good value ,0
 not being informed prior to booking about the building works going on cramped room not being given the room we reserved the most uncomfortable bed i have ever slept on would have found sleeping on the floor more comfortable bed was like concrete and pillows were too big with no cushioning ,0
 best location for the o2 literally a 2 minute walk perfect ,1
 room extremely small 5m2 overall very uncomfortable bed it is not what you see on the advertised photos absolutely horrible breakfast i had the worst breakfast experience staying at a hotel an asian origin lady apparently the boss is running her dictatorship at the restaurant first thing you hear when you walk down to the restaurant for breakfast is what you cannot eat waitresses are super stressed there s an obvious tension on the floor nobody smiles you can t even sit where you want in the restaurant felt like north korea wifi terrible it takes you few mins to connect then it hardly loads anything had to use personal mobile data overall i felt ripped off definitely not value for money avoid staying at norfolk ,0
 everthing not clean and dirty not comfortable noise of next room ,0
 the location is very central and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly,1
 we have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms there are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special our room 065 was just gorgeous ,1
 deceptively bad location its in a perfectly nice part of paris but theres a consistant crowd of homeless and alcoholic people right outside ,0
 dirty carpet awful room too small beds too smelly ,0
 facilities very out of date need a good refurbishing very cramped compared to london way too expensive for what they offer poor wifi ,0
 the property was disgusting ,0
 location and staff,1
 great location good breakfast clean and modern hotel some mentioned the rooms to be tiny but i thought it was a good size room for london room got a bit cold but the heater in the room worked really well unlike some of the reviews i read also the front desk called to check in and see if the room was alright nice touch of customer service ,1
 great staff really helpful good location,1
 kettle did not work not even a sorry but a smart remark asking if i switched it on tape on the wallpaper ,0
 bed really comfy room was perfect temperature great selection at breakfast ,1
 great location close to the underground staff were very helpful and lovely to deal with,1
 the location is really the best there are lots of places to eat and close to the metro as well you re a 10 15 minute walk away from the notre dame as well our room was lovely comfy beds and enough space for 2 girls with way more luggage than necessary we also had a view of the eiffel tower which was a super surprise when we looked out of the window perfect ,1
 the staff really looked after the customers in a very polite and professional manner ,1
 the hotel is in a great location and they upgraded my room ,1
 elegant hotel a block away from banks two subway stations one stop from paddington train station and near restaurants nicely decorated rooms and has an elevator breakfast rooms are auper elegant and breakfast is outstanding full english breakfast buffet for 12 per person prepaid staff is very nice and helpful they have a nice bar area and a reception area with computer and printer area it is a great hotel and right across the street from kensington and hyde parks ,1
 room was lovely over looking river bed was one of the most comfortable i have slept in i visited with my daughter and she loved the bath and the shower was amazing staff were friendly and attentive and nothing was to much trouble my daughter and i were attending a concert it was lovely that the hotel had a corridor to the o2 arena so we arrived at the concert relaxed and refreshed when the concert had ended we didn t have to worry about rushing to get out check out was easy would definitely visit again and recommended to others,1
 the hotel charged us 12 5 for continental breakfast because we made the booking through booking com if we had not payed for breakfast in advance the price would have been 9 50 just those small things thar irritates you when we pointed out the strange in this they would just shrug it of without giving any refund so it seems if you book through the any site they actually try to get some extra out of you just makes me mad ,0
 the room was incredibly luxurious and clean the staff were friendly and attentive the location was brilliant a perfect hotel ,1
 my wife i had spider bites on my arm forehead chest the hotel should keep the room safe for clients i will never stay there again,0
 overall great place to stay good staff,1
 location quiet ,1
 staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble rooms have everything you need very clean and comfortable very quiet love the ducks second stay at this hotel last was at christmas stayed in the same room comfortable walking distance to st paul s south bank and covent garden to name but a few will definitely stay again ,1
 i was in a room directly under the very noisy boiler room which was extremely noisy,0
 we went there on the day terror attacks happened we couldnt leave the hotel as our uber wouldnt pick us up the bar closed early we was suppose to have a riverside view room and never got it either ,0
 you can here all sound from corridor when you walk sound coming from floor bed is not comfortable very soft i need to pass by the bar each time i need to go to my room,0
 the room was very small and sheets towels were dirty ,0
 things wrong with the hotel room 1 no matter where you set the heating the room was cold 2 room 697 is at the end of a long corridor and the hot water for shower took several minutes to reach the room 3 the kettle only worked if you hold the switch down with your hand until it boiled 4 only one of the 4 lights in the bathroom worked 5 there was a crack in the sink that stretched from one side to the other when i go to a hotel i want it to be right when i arrive rather than after i have brought to their attention a list of problems i did go to reception to complain but there was a queue and only 1 receptionist i didn t have time to wait ,0
 nice hotel clean comfortable good location and most important thing is an excellent friendly helpfully staff,1
 was a lovely comfy bed and they gave my daughter a birthday cake as we came london for her 13th birthday nice clean room and lovely breakfast,1
 everything was just a disgrace to be honest will not stay or recommend to any body,0
 fabulous stay at the russell an ornate hotel in a great location staff very welcoming and all with a smile on their face loved it will be back ,1
 food was not good at all have to pay room service for water,0
 we upgraded to a larger room had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep i ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds ,1
 the bed was extremely comfortable and the room spacious the location is ideal just a 5 10 minute walk from covent garden ,1
 too old and not clean at all ,0
 fantastic staff that could not have been more helpful friendly and professional,1
 we had a good stay but pls inprovise ur indian items in breakfast and cuisine thnkssss,1
 very helpful staff friendly and welcoming good room service great shower quite stylish room if a little soul less sadly had to leave early before we could sample the breakfast ,1
 we were asked for id on arrival but had already paid for the room breakfast was sparse and we had a club king room which was tiny there was just enough room to walk round the bed ,0
 i had booked a deluxe tower view room and had made contact via telephone to guarantee optimal room for a wedding proposal plan turned up was given access card to a room that was already occupied and had people in the room where out baggage and engagement ring had been sent to then there were no rooms so given a disabled access room 2 floors below overlooking the football pitch nowhere near what i had booked or paid for and pre arranged once given that room bose sound system didn t work and had to call to replace it the maintenance person just let himself into our room and my partner was getting into her robe it was one thing after another and i will list my full experience in a detailed complaint i had set about writing a detailed gym review and have this featured on my site but unless invited back to experience a stay i should have received i have completely given up on any such report ,0
 the price of the room declared on the website is not what you are going to pay i booked my room for two nights for 465 and prepaid it online but really was charged about 490 it turned out that the hotel before charging converted the eur amount at which i booked a room into the usd at a much higher exchange rate than the real one then they charged my eur bank account with an increased usd amount when i wrote to them asking to reimburse the difference they refused to do it apparently they consider that each customer is an idiot and will not notice that or they make you pay for the commission charged by their bank or payment system even though 6 is too much of a charge it is not even for the money but the attitude which is astonishing never came across such a hotel in my country that would be called a fraud and would make a case for the police a customer should not be cheated like that i can only image how they fool people if they do it with everyone paying online really for a 4 star hotel that charges 230 per night that is a shame ,0
 big rooms super facilities two tvs espresso machine cups and dishes with splendid soft bed and comfortable bathroom highly recommended for families with kids great location near tube bus stops museums london eye ,1
 we got a great deal through booking com called the shopping package fabulous value for two nights a good breakfast friendly staff and beautiful building ,1
 whole stay was excellent,1
 definitely not 5 quality maybe it was just our room but then charge 3 rates for the smaller noisier room would have expected a room like this in a travellodge very noisy with our room right next to the stairs to the breakfast room and a public toilet right outside our door not ideal ,0
 foyer was a mess only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two we had a very cold spell and it was draughty the first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights the second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair the hotel states it is four star but is not it feels like a up graded backpackers it is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max i thought i was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was the hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking it was very disappointing and embarrassing as i had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms ,0
 they gave me a smoking room which was not really clean with plenty stains on the room carpets and passage which i specifically said i did not want a smlking room when i tried to change they said they were fully booked i asked for an iron in the morning took over an hour to come to my room ,0
 friendly welcome stunning interiors nice quiet room so we had a good night s sleep we found the location to be ideal and the parking very nearby,1
 good service friendly and helpful staff location was nice close to hyde park have a few shops and restaurants around the corner hotel and rooms was clean and well maintained ,1
 everything they just grab your money,0
 the beds were perfect service great bathroom fantastic good location to take the train from paddington station loved it ,1
 the front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant,1
 i stayed in the property for three nights where the room was noisy and staffs has disturbe ne alot with bringing the security to the room for late check out staff was unpolit and i had been promised by the front desk manager to resolve the issue and i am still waiting no reply be careful of staffs at this hotel,0
 great position lovely having breakfast overlooking beautiful garden which you could have a walk around or seat and relax staff were very helpful and friendly ,1
 quiet yet very handy location for a number of london theatres including the savoy although we didn t use the bar it looked very inviting with the option to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine ,1
 position of the hotel very noisy indeed due to the main road little sleep obtained initially staff put us in a standard room instead of superior room this was rectified once we highlighted the problem food in the restaurant was appalling my daughter and i both left all of our main meals wet carpets in the bedroom not enough tea milk on the second day there were several areas of dried vomit just outside the hotel door this was offensive and should have been washed away ,0
 the fact we had to pay for the facilities in the hotel the hotel was very shabby with the lack of investment in the hotel very clearly on show ,0
 no television,0
 great location beautiful old building ,1
 i would like to thank the kindness of mrs rocio of the restaurant and manuel of the bar they was very polite and nice ,1
 very organised great facilities,1
 the style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom our kingsize was very comfy and spacious the hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings all of the staff spoke english perfectly just like most people in the city and i couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places hotel arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to centraal dam square rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring it s also right next to oosterpark so i can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in amsterdam as it was mine ,1
 the location was fantastic a two minute walk to kensington gardens we felt very well located and had everything we needed nearby the staff was exceptional and extremely helpful and friendly we highly recommend ,1
 the facilities are tired and begging for renovation the novotel coming up opposite the hotel will take away a greater number of her customers ,0
 extremely small rooms service doesn t match 4 stars hotel ,0
 small room not modern and very scruffy shower didn t work properly drafty window,0
 the room and the beds,0
 wifi location room service early checkout the staff making nosy at 9 am to make check out,0
 they dont clean well and they didnt clean the mugs and cups since i came whenever i want a clean mugs i have to call and they keep it in the room without cleaning the staff always angry and not kind i was really disappointed ,0

 everything,0
 nice breakfast,1
 staff were incredibly friendly an helpful rooms were spacious and comfortable breakfast best o any hotel so far location and proximity to metro superb ,1
 everything the staff were rude and not helpful at all cancelled my booking before i arrived and had to rebook not worth the money ,0
 atmosphere staff location and decoration,1
 staff was the rudest ever seen by me they were not ready to speak in a good way and in evening you have to wait for a hour to checkin because no one will be available on desk if some one is there than expect that he will entertain you in a hour this is normal for them,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful,1
 our junior suite was exceptionally tired a challenging room very noisy and cold not at all restful in any way wires hanging under the tv poor standard of decoration especially in the bathroom taps in bath overbath shower very stiff and difficult to regulate no water or hot water on the final day dirty walls in bathroom poor recognition of problems by staff zero response mouldy bread in toast bin at breakfast ,0
 a great central location within walking distance of many of london s attractions ,1
 the staff were great and made me feel very comfortable as a lone female ,1
 room was small and noisy the air con sounded like a tractor and the noise from outside was constant all night if you want a good night sleep don t stay here we had an executive room so for the extra cost you get a dressing gown which we didn t use 2 bottles of water which are not replaced for the second night and some shower gels the room is small and has no drawers for clothes we won t be returning,0
 they gave me room and air condition not working and they brought a small air condition with out benefit and the duty manager not ready to help or change the room since i m regular guest to the same hotel since 5 years twice a year and they don t want deal with me as loyal gust ,0
 no breakfast included the bed was really comfy and room really great,1
 excellent location next to a metro station beatiful victorian architecture close to restaurants highly recommended ,1
 great staff polite friendly sky club eighteen had amazing views beds very comfortable ,1
 room was too small the wifi is too poor they have give me an upgrade to a smaller room this hotel is 3 4 star at max,0
 as we were up for a function in middle temple hall location could not have been better very comfortable room and very obliging staff,1
 great location pleasant room free candys ,1
 a very very tired tired looking hotel stained carpets peeling wallpaper chipped and stained baths worn and scratched furniture it was also rather noisy it was fairly well priced to be fair but i wish i d spent a bit more somewhere else ,0
 we selected the location for easy access to amenities transportation etc but the elegance of the property made us look forward to returning home at the end of a hectic day ,1
 reception staff incredibly attentive helpful and approachable,1
 tram right around the corner and biscuits with the tea in the room lovely touch,1
 see above,0
 we inadvertently booked two rooms instead of one we had to pay the full amount as the hotel made no attempt to rent out the extra room in our confirmation email the two room booking was not mentioned they also got the date wrong and has us booked in a day early which i did see and draw their attention to the shower drain was also blocked ,0
 staff poor parking terrible do not have enough parking spaces for the size off the hotel ,0
 hotel russell is a lovely old hotel with a wonderful location minutes to the british museum and with the tube right around the corner the standard double was fine clean comfortable and roomy enough for our week in london my wife especially appreciated the deep tub in the large bathroom ,1
 the rooms were extremely small and dirty the bedsheets were not clean and there was a spider on the bed we ordered room service on 2 occasions and it did not arrive and there was no apology from staff when we called to cancel the order 2 hours later there was a bathroom leak and we had to get our room changed the second room we were put in was smaller all this when i informed the hotel months ago that we were celebrating my mums 60th let alone provide us something complementary they ruined the stay for us with poor service ,0
 the web site said free breakfast i even took a photo the staff said no free breakfast at 200 a night i would expect breakfast my family and i have stayed in your establishments all over the country and never had such a bad experience and being told no you have to pay more ,0
 the reception team were welcoming extra helpful our superior double was very comfortable with a great view of the river ,1
 unexpected complimentary room upgrade upon arrival ,1
 nice room ,1
 nothing,0
 eventhough stated very clearly in our reservation we have not been allocated to the big frontal rooms even the staff has promised to change our rooms in the second day they not changed our rooms for 7 days also for 3 consecutive times in two nights there were fire alarms going off and no reason what so ever was told us the management of the situation was awful and unprofessional the rooms are really small and not useful the breakfast is expensive overall we have not been happy at all with our stay i will not stay in this hotel anymore,0
 next door to and linked with the o2 parking reasonable for location and easy access to and from hotel,1
 their robot style system ,0
 location of the hotel was really good i was heading to a concert at the 02 and what i found great was the hotel had its own link to the arena so we did not need to walk 14 mins to the arena the room was so nice we got an upgrade to a conner view room which was lovely definitely will stay there again i would stay longer than one night ,1
 location,1
 mattress worn o,0
 like all britannia hotels this one needs some refurbishment why do they never wash there windows charging to use hotel facilities e g swimming pool parking very uncomfortable beds but i suppose they were the most reasonably priced in the area,0
 amazing room perfect view and lovely helpful staff ,1
 front desk was very rude upon check in they asked for payment even if they have my credit card as guarantee they immediately asked for my cash payment they say it s their policy for first time guests and reservations made through internet if they don t trust internet booking they should be deleted from any internet booking group very strict with number of people very noisy since beside a construction site ,0

 peaceful location overlooking a pretty little park yet close to a number of good cafes and restaurants ideal for visiting our student son living nearby we were upgraded as we had mentioned when booking through booking com that it was also a special wedding anniversary we had a lovely corner suite with 3 large windows and a good sized bathroom ,1

 location central to everything this trip was for a birthday and we even got a small cake in our room,1
 the shower was terrible merely warm the first 2 days the carpet underneath the air conditioner was soaked very noisy unfortunately would not stay there again nor would i recommend it ,0
 the room smelt weird it was pretty small room a random alarm went off in the middle of the night which flashed red and blue no windows so no view and it was really warm even with air con on was extremely disappointed with my stay ,0
 bad customer service some of the staff in the front desk and duty manager were not helpful at all and female duty manager was rude and laughing and making fun and not trying to help us we arrived around 10 30 am and we had to wait for long time and didn t get our room till 4 pm after a long flight and hectic day they were not helping or giving any alternatives or possible solutions and it was very unpleasant experience we were very disappointed ,0
 modern look and feel clean good tech entertainment in room and a comfy bed ,1
 room was dingy and old fashioned bed was ancient and uncomfortable musty smell in the room ,0
 we asked for a room with a view stuck us in front of parking we asked for a ride from the airport and did not even respond small room with no room to lay clothes a noisy air conditioner the entrance of a staff woman into a room without an invitation to a room when we were inside pretend to make sure everything is all right the bathroom sink was not cleaned all the days we were there somehow they got 4 stars we would give 3 max make no mistake and be fooled by the name hilton ,0

 easy access to 02 lovely comfortable beds friendly modern hotel ,1
 friendly helpful reception staff room comfort was better than other similar priced london hotels i ve stayed in recently ,1
 excellent staff friendly helpful and attentive quiet area opposite a small park but close walking distance to bars restaurants and tube ,1
 no relaxing lounge with comfy armchairs settees no where to chill out in comfort have a little peace quiet pretty clueless reception staff overcrowded slow service bar restaurant more like a noisy staff canteen with ridiculously overpriced drinks even by london standards poor value poor quality breakfast located right on a busy noisy main road with poor sound insulation,0
 great location large comfortable rooms,1
 fantastic no other words needed,1
 a great selection for breakfast myself and my son were able to drop our bag in early and our room was ready too the staff were friendly close to bayswater and queensway tube stations and a few minutes walk into hyde park,1
 smelly wardrobe and the curtains i could not stop sneezing ,0
 hotel had lost our room reservation even though i had a confirmed booking made approx 12weeks prior to arrival selection of toiletries in bathroom was very poor soap shampoo gadget in shower almost impossible to operate lift was not working no explation given and did not look like it would be functioning any time soon ,0
 poor customer service and extremely rude duty manager,0
 the staff were very poor they were rude and difficult they required a 50 deposit even though the full amount for the room had been charged already ,0
 everything except the location,0
 soundproofing is a disaster staff at counter useless breakfast tray dusty,0
 the bathroom was utterly discussing and dirty as my pictures show there were stains all over the tap lime scale everywhere layers of pee and human waste in the toilet seat fixture some diy repairs and just dirt everywhere stains on the shower curtain the bedding was falling apart my fingers were getting tangled in fibres coming out of the covers there was a burn mark on one of the blankets and the sound knob in the bathroom with dirty and not working the ventilation in the bathroom didn t work and when we all took a shower in the morning everything got steamed up and the room became very hot the staff were unpleasant and that s out mildly the pool was also dirty and the staff was unpleasant to all the guests the breakfast area was chaotic it was like wacky races the floor was covered in food it was scary at times our room wasn t cleaned on daily basis and we had to used wet towels the next again day i feel we were ripped off it s a hovel and not a hotel please avoid at all costs ,0

 the staff were fabulous very courteous and helpful always very cheery and making one feel at ease the rooms were very comfortable and the bars restaurants were all top quality the walkway to the o2 was a brilliant addition if going there for a concert i could not find fault with anything at this hotel ,1
 restaurant is dual purpose good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff breakfast very ordinary i am afraid food from the cooked options cold toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options eggs benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service ,0
 the wifi didn t work the double room was so small it was difficult to walk around the bed the ensuite was again very small no hot water only one powerpoint on the other side of the bed which made it very difficult to put up an ironing board which was a waste of time because the iron didn t work ,0
 some of the staff were very rude,0
 comfortable bed and a good sized room able to make hot drinks and having an ice machine in the hallway was a bonus water and sweets were left for us on arrival staff dealt with problems with the room quickly could to see part of the london eye and big ben from the window so we enjoyed the view laundry room was useful when you have a longer stay ,1
 central location clean friendly hotel ,1
 location size of room quality quietness considering it was in the centre of london,1
 nice comfy bed very luxurious bathroom,1
 the fire alarms seem to work staff are pleasant and professional building full of character ,1

 returned to find a man with a knife in his hand going through our bags reception didn t care and didn t think it was worth notifying police also suspect reception skimmed our credit card,0
 the location was next to the metro and many cafes but the room was quiet tight on space but had everything we needed ,1
 the staff were so professional kind and friendly breakfast wise the food was amazing ,1
 the staff were the friendliest most helpful people they couldn t do enough for us the room was really clean and the bed was so comfortable thank you and what a view there is a walkway to the o2 so it was great to be so close to the venue ,1

 breakfasts reception staff very helpful,1
 not worth it very dirty waste of money,0
 everything this was not 1 2 miles from the o2 bathroom was filthy staff was unhelpful tried to order room service for 30 mins and they kept picking up the phone and putting the phone down ,0
 everyone specially the chef was very friendly and helpful the passage to o2 arena was really useful going to the concert and coming back was unbelievably easy and comfortable ,1
 all of it should be condemed,0
 the man at reception was very unfriendly didn t seem to make an effort with us at all when we asked him questions regarding the room and other information he was not helpful and seemed arrogant he was very blunt and made us both feel very uncomfortable the bathroom was also not very clean i could see mould around the floor and tiles ,0
 room really cosy and clean,1
 hotel is very bad staff is dirty no safety no meals or food,0
 the location is superb close to sights restaurants and metro the room was cosy but clean and well serviced,1
 they did not give us the type of room that we had booked ,0
 the temperature in the room was too high summer time it was poorly air conditioned and it felt like i was in a sauna because of that sleeping throught the night in this hotel was the worst part of my trip to london and it s a 4 star hotel yeah right,0
 the staff was not helpful for 6 days and did not fix the path rooms after 8 complaints and the managers refused to see to discuss my complain but after insisting he met me twice unless he knows why the parking is very poor and the team is not organized every day during my stay i do self parking in the hote and they are charging a valet parking price last time to stay in this hotel,0
 our stay at the fitzrovia was a frustrating one we booked a double room and initially the toilet did not work we called down and the staff instructed us how to fix it and later that evening the toilet was completely broken the next morning we were woken up to construction with no heads up about it we contacted the front desk in the morning regarding the toilet and construction and kindly asked to change rooms they told us to come down and they would sort it out once we came down we talked to the reception who told us we wouldn t be able to change rooms until at least an hour later this was after the took our room key for the room we had we explained to them that this was all very incovienent as we had literally woken up and headed right downstairs the reception then asked us if we had nothing else to do until our room was ready honestly this was insulting we are entitled to stay in our hotel room all day if we wanted to we asked about breakfast and the lady told us we could pay 18 we sat in the lobby where we asked for a glass of water which did not come until over an hour later our room was ready the room we changed into was pretty much the same thing we emailed the manager of the hotel regarding this whole ordeal as the service was truly horrible we felt unappreciated unwelcomed and uncomfortable something that should not happen at a four star hotel the hotel manager called our room and then proceeded to apologise and said how she notices we were interested in the breakfast i am actually appalled i did not send an email to get a free breakfast but to ensure this service does not happen to any other guest very insulting the hotel itself is fine but the service is questionable will not be coming back ,0
 location very convenient walking distance to tube station room clean and comfortable size staff very friendly in hotel ,1
 from the moment we arrived the experience was first rate leo i think offered a warm welcome and went that little step further than than usual check in you d expect the room was modern comfortable and spacious we didn t get to use all the facilities but the general assessment was of the highest quality throughout the staff were brilliant breakfast was like nothing i ve had in other hotels and everything in the hotel was immaculate we were visiting the o2 for a lionel ritchie concert so location was perfect being literally next door ,1
 a truly excellent hotel and a wonderful place to stay with great facilities but the hotel had quite clearly hiked up the prices for the event which i was attending across the river at the excel not happy with that at all ,1
 size not modern not value for money,0
 beautiful hotel fantastic staff kind helpful friendly knowledgable great breakfast selection beautiful common areas perfect location for our needs ,1
 great bathroom very good breakfast and great location just 5 mins walk to hyde park lancaster gate tube station and a few nice pubs ,1
 it was a well kept hotel in a lovely area the staff and services offered were excellent we felt it was a great value our beautiful room with a view was a bonus ,1
 near the tube good breakfast,1
 most of the hotel,1
 i was given a room on the top floor and was not made aware by the reception staff that very noisy works were going on above me to extend the hotel upwards there was noise when i got into the room at 5pm and an unbelievable racket commenced at 8 in the morning so much so that you could not stay in the room the rooms on the top floor are not fit for occupation under these conditions and should be not made available or sold at very discounted rates there is also no natural light into the room due to a canopy over the central atrium so it feels like constant night time when you are in the room ,0
 it has been only 2 weeks this hotel has started to perform it was really good experience with good staff professional service and unique interior design location is very central rooms are very clean i really recommended this hotel for your paris trip thank you panache team ,1
 clean comfy refurbished and well located,1
 being new in this area the conceierge service is excellent special thanks to mr francis who was on duty and helped my colleague and myself several times throughout our stay ,1
 layout of the room shower bathroom facilities ,1
 we stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation it has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings would definitely stay there again ,1
 at past midnight on 25 june front desk staff on duty a gentleman with short hair stubble beard was rude when asked why there was no one at the front desk a guy was checking in and no one was around he knocked at the door around my 16yr old son was waiting for 15 mins as well to get his luggage for deposit while we were off to scotland the next day front desk stout lady replied why don t you work here to know what it s like in the hospitality industry this is a no no sad for my innocent son to face people who don t have a passion for what they do ,0
 everything you need to make a short break easy a decent hair dryer an iron that gets hot and you don t have to wait an hour for the bath to fill simple things that many london hotels still cannot provide in 2016 cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in and very comfortable almost 5 star ,1

 i loved everything about this hotel the breakfast was amazing the bed was really comfy the rooms were stunning and everything was really clean the staff were so friendly and helpful when we needed something,1
 the rooms was so so small double room was too small for us and noise everyday morning but j don t know from where i will never stay in this hotel again becouse i paid 268 pound for nights which did not worth 100 pound it was a very big disappoint for me and for my neice ,0
 comfort and location ,1

 slow and not well informed staff light in rooms is terrible reading light in blue led ,0
 everything,0
 the room was very hot when i arrived the sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective the inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows i asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was i assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while i was out however they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night made for a poor nights sleep ,0
 old fashioned lots of outside noise itchy sheets and thin towels poor tv signal,0

 hotel is located in very rough area of the paris due to that we had to order unhealthy take aways unable to explore and experience local area travel via uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet ,0
 very old and unrefurbished furniture a very small hotel with poor service delivery,0
 nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light a lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction ,1
 the room was so small i couldn t even put my clithes on properly it was part of the landing that got sectioned off and made into a room this was not fairly reflected in the booking process and the price was xomparable to other places i have stayed in where the room size was much better breakfast was served in the basement with very little ventilation which made the breakfast hall unbearable to sit in no wi fi in rooms either which is atrocious ,0
 no power plug near bad street is under heavy construction ,0
 very clean and easily accessible to the earls court tube station,1
 staff were helpful well informed and took the time to answer questions in detail re travel time to allow etc the hotel was scrupulously clean smelling fresh ,1
 good location across road from the tube station about 10 minutes from central london ,1
 i admit that i was tempted by the very convenient price but this comes with a price the hotel is the classic charter mass tourism place buses continuously offloading million of noisy and hungry tourists the hotel itself appear sort of old england style up to the first steps and then it becomes a monks style environment especially the bedroom cell definitely a never again ,0
 there was refurhbishment work going on air con not working the first room we were offered was an airless oven the staff moved us to another room which was ok but still no air con there were workmen on the scaffolding outside so not much privacy noisy plaster dust outside the room although the room itself was clean a bit of a disappointment but we were only there for two nights so we decided to put up with it breakfast disappointing although all the staff were very friendly ,0
 the room i was told it was easy access infact it was a disabled room ,0
 room service food stained carpet musty smell in room,0
 had to move rooms extra bed broken when we mentioned the broken bed was told we know no bed linen for the extra bed breakfast was cold on day 1 portion size was small i counted 9 beans on my plate we won t be using the hotel again ,0
 issues with the water pump in the bathroom lead to no sleep all night we were told there were no other rooms available and the manager also confirmed the issue with his plumbers the next morning even so he would only offer us a room upgrade and a complimentary breakfast the next time we stayed for the inconvenience caused none of the staff spoke very good english either,0
 really nice hotel and room and staff,1
 room was a match box could barely pass end of bed and the wall ridiculous for what i had to pay would never return ,0
 horrible bedding polyester blanket on top of a sheet not even covered worst ever ,0
 the breakfast was very good and plentiful for 10 euros,1
 location comfy beds nice staff apples in reception ,1
 first day first room very poor just a bed and tv no balcony the second room ugliest and dirty the second had a terrace sea full of mold cockroaches and spiders room dirty floor unwashed smell bad i spoke to the receptionist but he told me that i have to stay in that room until the next day i resisted until 12 at night i felt sick i could not breathe my tongue numb and feeling faint had to go there in another room or another hotel receptionist gave me another room better it had air conditioner so better on another day the staff from cleaning forgot to pass on my room to 5 30 pm another day one of the staff originally from sry lanka with a gentleness invited me to go out with him for a coffee or a drink another staff asked me if i have to give him a cigarette when i left the hotel the receptionist said if i want taxi i have to pay 35 euro or the taxi it was 12 euro,0
 smalllest room ever for 2 persons two different elevators and lots av walking within the hotel corrido by corridor to reach the room 663 had to back in the room because of idiotic door construction will not recommend you can have a similar room for half the price 75 steps away ,0
 all of the staff were friendly and room 1119 was excellent our evening meal in the italian restaurant was delicious ,1

 location facilities car park on site,1
 restaurant food terrible hotel undergoing renovations the lifts were rubbish we waited for 11 lifts going up and down and ended up using the goods lift to get down,0
 the groove was very friendly and forth coming,1
 the hotel is really old fashion looks like 1970 s lobby is very dark checkin time was 15 minutes for only 3 customers in front of me a business guy came late and passed in front of everybody else thanks to his premium membership this is offensive and makes you non premium member feel miserable the room was okish but the decoration is old looking and dark the table is full of bumps and glitches the mini bar was empty the airco blowing noise and cold i could reduce a bit the fan but not switch it off so the next morning i had a headache the restaurant is in the huge lobby quite dark and not cosy at all so i went across the street to the trattoria bellagio last but not least the wifi was free but useless as the speed was near to none i turned back to my 4g overall the experience was far below expectations and not reaching the level hyatt regency deserves ,0
 clean comfortable room in large friendly conference hotel with plenty of facilities and great location ,1
 very small unclean rooms and uncooperative staff parking is scarce ,0
 great location close to 2 underground stations nice sandwich shop around the corner for a light breakfast close to grocery shopping and dining bar in hotel ,1
 location hotel decor room decor and cleanliness bathroom breakfast swimming pool everything is comfortable and makes you want to stay longer will definitely stay again ,1

 very pleased with this hotel stayed there for my wife s birthday and they decorated the room for me with balloons and happy birthday message on the window plus a little card ment a lot was upgraded to a studio for free with veiw of london eye will stay here again,1
 the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when i reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working i stayed there 14 days never again ,0
 bathroom incredibly small room facing a pub which meant noise throughout the night way to pricey for what it is upon arrival was asked to make a pre authorization on my card with the amount of the stay 50 so when i made the payment the following morning i had payed twice the price of the stay plus 50 even if it is just a pre authorization on your card it still means you won t be able to use that money for 7 days doesn t make sense why don t they ask for the payment upfront ,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful to accommodate our stay the location was great within walking distance of the tube station which was great for our young ones little legs ,1

 the room was horrific ripped carpets with stains all over grubby bathroom and furniture all burn marks and stains ,0
 food service ,0
 false advertising which said the room was soundproof that s why i decided to pay extra to stay here it was a complete lie the walls were paper thin a woman next door was drunk and ranted and yelled at her boyfriend for hours then she started throwing things i complained to the concierge a couple of times finally he came up and tapped gently on the disruptive woman s door she didn t answer and he left without talking to her fortunately she quieted down around 1 a m probably because the alcohol put her to sleep the concierge still should ve talked to her to discourage such behavior in the future the next morning a different concierge double charged me for the room instead of simply adding breakfast to my bill he also added the cost of my room and insisted this new total would replace the old total i was skeptical i said the bank had no way of knowing how many nights i stayed he acted condescending in the stereotypical parisian way as if i was an idiot who didn t understand the nuances of banking well i was charged for two nights and it took multiple calls to the hotel and my bank to straighten it out incompetence and rudeness is a combination that s hard to forgive ,0
 client can t turn off air conditioner the other one is very tall but taken to a room with small bed fell down to ground in the deep sleep their bathrooms are not clean enough to stay compared with their past experiences in hilton said would send a solving e mail to us haven t received until now ,0
 construction work and drilling all day manager very rood beware of this hotel ,0
 the ridiculous run around i was given by yourselves and the hotel when trying to pre pay for the room du to the fact that i would nt actually be staying at the hotel the fact that it took 3 viewings for my party to find a room i pre paid for 2 breakfasts only for my party to be told that they could nt have breakfast at 6 50 7am in the morning with regards to a refund they were told to speak to the manager who of course was not working at the time ,0
 the room was very poor towel had stain duvert cover was wear and tear at side very cheap furniture in room bathroom was simple and plain there was a construction outside so you can hear the building noise at very early morning the room just like b b type ,0
 breakfast very good great selection of food and drink great breakfast room ,1
 broken bed,0
 took me three rooms until i was satisfied the first room was like a bunker no windows it said deluxe double the second wasn t finished it looked like partially finished the third was better but i should not of had to complain very disappointed for the money i paid for staying i would definitely not be back there ,0
 very nice location within walking distance of all the main attractions and theatres the view from our window was the icing on the cake overlooking the london eye and the houses of parliament the staff were extremely friendly and helpful with nothing being too much trouble ,1
 it is a begging xx century building with very comfortable and warm rooms the building was conceived by the same architect of the titanic elegant restaurant ,1
 my business trip to paris was cancelled due to a french air traffic controller strike no flights available the hotel was completely unhelpful and rude when i asked if i could change my reservation to the following week but had no problem charging me the full room rate ,0
 took the english breakfast and found it was a good way to start the day the front desk lent me an adapter so i could recharge my north american laptop and this was greatly appreciated found that the heathrow express which i had booked wouldn t work for me and the staff arranged an early morning taxi again greatly appreciated ,1
 staff were so friendly and efficient great location fabulous breakfast club room very spacious and modern,1
 total disaster this hotel barely would deserve a 1 if in london there would be a real star classification system small room looking like it hasnt been refurbished since 1950 ,0
 all staff,0
 the room the first room i walked into smelt like someone had been smoking in there the carpet had stains all over it and the bathroom was basic nothing like the pictures make it look like the wooden tv cabinet and the like had mug stains all over them and were very unappealing the deal breaker for me was the seamen stain on the corner of one of the bed bases i walked down and asked for a refund and to go elsewhere as this was booked through booking com they could not do this they upgraded me to a satisfactory room which still looked outdated the only nice thing was the bathroom in this one my room was also only made up on one of the 3 days i stayed despite leaving a make me up sign on the outside of the door wouldn t stay again ever the rating on booking com swayed me to book this place next time i ll do more research ,0
 solid allrounder,1
 the beds are amazing here the room view was awesome we overlooked the o2 and the river bonus of a tassimo coffee machine and sound system in the bathroom there is even a private walkway to the o2 from the hotel ,1
 the district very close to the city center but a quiet place,1
 the hotel nowhere near a 4 star,0
 julian the reception front desk guy was super rude and incompetent in his job when we check in we handed our passport to him he misplaced if for nearly an hour he then realized it was under the computer shouted at us and accused us not giving him the passport when our passports emerged he throw us the room key instead of giving us the key never ever stay in this hotel no cctv zero service ,0
 the breakfast was superb with all the hot food piping but amazingly not over cooked the ambience of the building is amazing and as a history buff i love the historical associations ,1
 poor lift small room loads of noise from neighbouring rooms floor squeaking convos etc poor customer service at breakfast poor parking shocking door for the bathroom all in all really disappointed with this hotel which is allegedly 4 worst booking i have made on this site ,0
 excellent location 5 min walk from queensway and central line tube clean room with all you need comfy bed tea coffee facilities hot water for a good shower hairdryer tv very friendly staff ,1
 the complete lack of transparency of this hotel and it s policies and it s staff i ve never seen in all my trips and hotel stays a hotel that takes a pathetic deposit at checkin to then only start taking money during night shifts from my card without my authorisation because to their own admission they want to make sure people don t leave without paying this is truly lame not ever heard of pre approval to not mention the impossibility to have in the room fridge any drinks as its their policy apparently to not service tower rooms with that another incredible one was second evening the shower was and remained cold impossible to do shower attitude of staff not fit for a hilton if you want to save yourself grief do not book here ,0
 the artisan restaurant was absolutely amazing,1
 super shower,1
 staff very rude kept on being harrased on time of check out plus spoken to by one staff member very badly ,0
 comfortable pleasant staff excellent location ,1
 while we stayed for 5 nights and on the third floor there was no elevator working the bathroom faucets were broken in the bathtub including drain shower rod kept falling down shower curtain had orange mildew on it the air conditioning was very loud we paid for a deluxe room and slept in a hard old double bed poor lighting only lit one side of room no view other than large rooftop ventilation system the pictures posted on your website did not come close to what we experienced this is definitely not a four star hotel by our experience ,0
 just great ,1
 very poor in need of refurbishment the pool had no changing rooms the sauna didn t work the heating in the bedroom didn t work the hotel had no supervisor or manager a young lady was running the hotel alone very unsafe in event of a fire etc we left early due to the experience the hotel cost was refunded after various arguments with the lady who couldn t contact the manager who was in spain ,0

 exceptional hotel with incredibly attentive staff in a beautiful location we had a wonderful break and will absolutely stay here again when we return to paris ,1
 so we got to the hotel and found the room is not at all like the pictures they provides we found out the room is very dirty and the bed cannot fit my legs and we complain about it to the receptionist and her response was you can cut them ,0
 the hotel is in a very central location but tucked away quite discreetly so it feels private the room was very comfortable no sound carried over from the rooms or hallways allowing us a decent night of sleep the bathroom was beautifully luxurious and clean we also had a drink in the hotel bar which was very good ,1
 the bed was clean very comfortable and a big king size the bathroom was clean perfect i ve stayed many times in different hotels in london some are bloody noisy in the morning with rubbish trucks or noisy kitchens below this hotel was ok great location for the city busses and the tube remember if you are over 65 bring your bus pass from home i m from liverpool we could use ours for free bus trips after 9 30am,1
 the room smelt like ciggerettes,0
 staff when we checked in anna felt us feel like home i always think that reception is the heart of a hotel the bed first seemed to be hard but ending being so comfortable and the shower was amazing great location near hammersmith tube station ,1
 i was not informed that the entire hotel is under renovation at time of booking if i had known i certainly would have booked elsewhere for the price the staff were not sympathetic to the situation however did say they were lodging a complaint with booking com because it was not clear at all that this was renovation taking place the entire front entrance was blocked by construction walls no lobby no tea room something we had planned to enjoy no spa available despite the advertisement that one existed way too much money for a 5 star hotel in this condition we could have stayed in a 2 star hotel and had a better experience will not book this hotel again may not use booking com either as this was misrepresentation ,0
 great location close to the tube british museum and in a nice leafy setting ,1
 we loved the hotel the room was great and the view from it on the 9th floor was fabulous the staff were all were helpful and everywhere looked lovely about a 5 min walk to the tube station which is serviced by 4 lines as well as the bus station the amazing westfield shopping centre is 2 stops away on the tube ,1
 executive studio had a great view comfy bed great bathroom tea coffee facilities excellent no street noise on 12th floor very clean great location for a base not luxurious but practically perfect really ,1
 staff is fantastic on request to bring in room more coffee and few extra cups we were surprised with knocking at the door less than in 5 minutes ,1
 the room was run down with dirty and loose wallpaper only one tea bag and one coffee sachet were provided limited view and noise from the lift ,0
 room to small staff not to social and as a guest y was not feeling comfortably,0
 staff were very helpful and professional at all times room was compact but of a good standard good selection of food at breakfast time ,1
 facilities at the room was not fully functioning and i had to change my room 2 times to have a good air conditioning breakfast is not at the same value of money i think with less money you can get a better place in paris ,0
 the staffs are really friendly and helpful pool and spa is great my girlfriend and i also love the bar on the 1st floor and 18th floor ,1
 terrible checking in process arrived at 3am to the property and mentioned to that fact to the hotel prior to hand they decide to log me into a room that is in a different block had to walk with my luggage in the rain with an incompetent bellboy who was literally taking way too much time closing the umbrella before going in while i waited in the rain the other rooms are ridiculously far from the main property room was terrible ground floor and not clean hair in sink lobby light into the room too much noise and just a terrible experience asked to be moved and had to walk all the way back into the main hotel in the rain to be given a room grade which i initially booked it just seemed that at the middle of the night that was the only room available asked to speak to the manager which was not communicated until he saw me checking out and asked about my stay overall would definitely not recommend the hotel for future stay as there are tons of other hotels in london that offer proper services at equivalent prices including other 4 star hotels ,0
 location breakfast and ambience,1
 i had realized if i booked my room through the hotel i could ve got better service and better room from my experience i realized everytime i booked through booking com i get the worse room in hotel i bet you if they have room in the basement they will give it to me because i booked through the net i have to argue to get a better room and i still did not ,0
 personnel was be very good ,1
 loved the location and the staff were great the room was very impressive ,1
 the room was to small and needs a better decoration the lift to small too,0
 check in,0
 stylish boutique on the charming place de la sorbonne best spot in paris on the left bank and walking or metro easy distance to everywhere wo want to see and do in this gorgeous city i have been staying at this hotel over 30 years and enjoyed the benefits of 5 makeovers ,1
 comfortable bed good location quiet area even biscuits in the room as well as usual tea and coffee ,1
 booked a twin room and on arrival found twin room was actually a double resulting in the other person in my party having to move to a room with no facilities whatsoever more space in a wardrobe lift out of order and narrow stairs unsuitable for disabled person staff at desk very unhelpful ,0
 reported our lights flashed like a disco within minutes of arriving in the room no action taken curtains too small for the window so light coming in from sunrise toilet cistern dripping all night not much sleep one bottle of complementary water for a 3 person suite reported and no action fire door reported to reception on check out that was coming off the hinges informed we would be called by the manager waited 10 days and still no contact ,0
 the location extremely cheap in comparison for the level of comfort location,1
 old building dirty horrible hotel,0
 i booked a room only deal so didn t use the restaurant for breakfast however otherwise i loved my room it was clean comfortable and atmospheric the staff were polite and helpful altogether a lovely old hotel please keep it that way ,1
 had to cut my stay from a week to couple of days due to emergency but they still have charged me in full and were not willing to discuss any solution whatsoever so be prepared for poor and unprofessional treatment ,0
 friendly staff good location ,1
 the hotel is really overpriced it is not a 4 star hotel the room smells of dirty the carpet was full of spots and is was really disgusting in the rooms the facilities were old fashion and needs renovation the room is small the breakfast was awful for the rate of the hotel the cleaning lady was cleaning the next room at 7 a m which i think is unacceptable the beds were not comfortable and there was a repair work early in the morning so we could nt sleep at all as we complained on the reception we were told it is not coming from our hotel but we saw the boys next to our room the airconditioner was not working properly the wifi connection was very bad we were really dissapoined at the end when we were leaving we asked for a taxi and with all the kids and the staff we were waiting the car for 50 minutes it was really a disappointed stay ,0
 we booked a club room however on arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite on 2nd floor well the bathroom was so small that when you stepped in door opening out into bedroom you were virtually on the toilet no room to swing a cat when sat on the loo my partners knees touched the door frame there was mould in the tile grout in the shower and the rain forest shower head dripped all night the heating in the room had no thermostat and as a result the radiators were on it was 21 degrees outside the air con didn t kick in to compensate the light on the telephone flashed all night saying there was a message eventually we put it on the floor with a pillow over it as we couldn t stop it even though we cleared the message the pillows on the large bed were lumpy like cotton balls inside the receptionist was very rude on the phone when the following day i queried a payment of 30 taken on my debit card for expenses it wasn t cleared off when i payed the bill as i had been told it was my job to phone the bank to put a stop on it ridiculous ,0
 totally outdated needs immediate refurbishment or close down ,0
 upon arriving at the hotel my immediate thought was wow this place looks nice then i got to the front desk what they saw was a person with a shaved head missing tooth jeans and a hoodie not a former ice hockey player who is now a director of a software company upon seeing this it was insisted that i pay for my room up front in full but was described as a deposit the term desposit according to the dictionary is to give as security or in part payment upon taking issue with this i asked for a manager to clarify why a deposit of the full balance was required when it is standard practice to pay on departure the manager couldnt answer the question without his long period of hesitation and put it down to my method of card payment now where i come from peterborough by way of birmingham both uk a visa card is a visa card so after proteacted dicsussion i reluctantly paid the full ballance and then went up to my room i then ordered room service which took them a while to get what i was asking for which was simiply a burger and wasnt allowed to charge this to my room and again had to pay up front again i have no issue with this typically but given the issue i had at the front desk a theme started to present itself when the burger came it wasnt the warmest of food even though it was freshly prepared room staff then pretty much forced their way into the room and then spilt one of the drinks all over my floor i am surprised they didnt try and charge me for the replacemet all other evenings for food were ok except one where the food was stone cold however a hot replacement was provided then the second day came and my room key had been deactivated upon going to the front desk i confronted the manager again who advised me that he personally had put a letter of apology in my room with a new key that would work for the duration of my stay great how do i get a key that has been put in a room that i cannot access ,0
 the bed was awful the most uncortable thing i ve ever slept it the bathroom didn t have a lightbulb i asked to have it changed three times and still wasn t done ,0
 1 too small for a hotel not comfortable at all 2 breakfast was not good 3 no facilities,0
 paid for a double superior room but it certainly did not feel like a superior had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the bedroom and there was hardly any space to move around the price of the room was too much for what we had ,0
 i booked a delux room and got a rabbit cage worst room ever in a hilton,0
 very comfortable and a great location very close to the underground and the british museum ,1
 the staff,1
 1 elevator was not working 3 out of 4 days 2 the room was the smallest room i ve ever slept in a 4 stars hotel 3 the bathroom door was broken for 3 days and i told the reception and they kept told me they will fix it and nothing happpened 4 window doesnt open 5 ac takes two hours to cool the room ,0

 the air conditioning in the enitre building did not work i had to move room three times the staff were not helpful and did not seem to care overall one of the worse hotels i ve stayed in and could not wait to leave ,0
 absolutely nothing i will never return to this hotel in my lifetime and will strongly suggest guests who are looking for a 5 star experience do not waste their money,0
 booked in october for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in january it was around 20 cheaper staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom back of bathroom door was very dirty very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel ,0
 it was a very tired hotel people seeing it for the first time would think it is nice but the standards have slipped it really needs up grading 22 years ago it was on par with the grand hotel in brighton,0
 poor staff uncommunicative and just not bothered,0
 poor water supply in evening and no hot water in the morning formal complaint and refund request submitted to best western,0
 good clean hotel very comfy bed good location not for from main train station ,1
 i would never stay here again nothing in the room worked properly and you would get better facilities at a hostel ,0
 when calling the front desk there was not always someone to answer the phone ,1
 gym spa sauna steam room rooms were very clean and done daily,1
 the area around this hotel boasts numerous restaurants that were very easy to access and had a variety of different cuisine the hotel staff were extremely friendly and very helpful not to mention the fabulous array of food for the buffet breakfast every morning outstanding overall a fabulous stay and somewhere i would definetly return to and recommend ,1
 the staff and atmosphere at this hotel is the best i have experienced for a 4 hotel this is my second visit and i would most definitely stay there again ,1
 excellent customer service we had been moved from grand royale to this hotel due to maintenance issue good communication from hotel beforehand very comfortable room and full english breakfast provided free of charge for the inconvenience ,1
 seemed superior to other hotels of a similar price excellent location near to restaurants and underground stations the hotel has wonderful wood decor and comfortable lounges ,1
 the location was fantastic for getting around easily the staff were very pleasant and the area was excellent ,1
 i disliked everything generally about this hotel first of all the photos on booking com were very misleading this is not a 4 class hotel i would rate it as a 2 class hotel it was absolutely poor value for money ,0
 great staff lovely breakfast ,1
 the room had an awful odor the room wasn t cleaned i found stains dirt and hair on every surface mold in the shower and brown stains on the towels provided ,0
 it s not the known premier inn it s another hotel premier notting hill so don t expect the same value for money,0
 friendly efficient sraff location price ,1
 place was flooded in the middle of the night no water in the hotel no toilet no shower nothing manager was very rude when confronted and did not have decency to reply to email not worth staying there better hotels and cheaper in the area,0
 it was a wonderful location for theatre land interior fabulous,1
 my room air condition didn t work and they didn t know how to fix it and i could n change the room very disappointed compare with the price the hotel is over price,0
 horrible location felt vulnerable as a single lady d cor old shabby and room cramped and uncomfortable not at all like the photo s on the web ,0
 the reservation staff was unhelpful and even unpolite for a 5 start you would expect to deal with better trained prople with a decent education that cand offer at least a trace of sofisticated service i hope i will not visit the hilton chain again in my life ,0

 the hotel is in major need of renovation the place is very old the room and bathroom were not clean at all the bed mattress was not comfortable but i had arrived in the morning and was too tired at night to care i was glad i was only there for one night the reason i stayed at that hotel was because it was next to my friend s flat which is where i spent the remainder of my stay in london ,0
 we had the penthouse suite for the night the views were out of this world the bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on the clouds the view over paris rooftops from the bed was like a dream highly recommend with the penthouse comes a roof top and that is so incredible ,1
 warm welcome at reception well located for visiting central london and west end comfortable and modern bedroom ,1
 room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need bed was very comfortable as well the surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road,1
 we met with the hotels manager to discuss several issues regarding the bad service and are still awaiting a resolution ,0
 bed very comfortable room quiet and peaceful restaurant staff efficient and welcoming they were doing their very busy job well whilst maintaining a calm unhurried atmosphere in the breakfast room well done there was an air of quiet respect no clattering of crockery etc the staff clearly take a pride in their work ,1

 rooms were very very hot inside changed rooms twice due to the rooms being stuffy and hot i also started getting heat spots and notified reception over 6 times and nothing was ever done air conditioning machine did not work room is to small and compact they claim to call it an executive room there was nothing executive about the room all a marketing spiel do not fall for this trap,0
 everything exceeded expectations ,1
 no room service every things you need it you should go to reception to collect bad staff on reception they don t have customer service skills prices so expensive overall hotel view train station,0
 the design of the rooms the wifi,0
 my room was number 23 the hotel was hosting christmas party s on both friday and saturday night the rooms aren t properly insulted and we heard music all night long ,0
 your staff s attitude at reception told to go to tesco for food due to technical fault in kitchen and no food available refused a refund and option to checkout and left without food in hotel your underground car park is a shambles and had to kick a rat away when parking the noise from the train outside is terrible and can be improved with proper windows the position of the tv on the wall is stupid from when you are in bed too ,0
 rooms were way too small the head board area had a small shelf that we hit with our head while getting in and out of bed,0
 hotel hallways and rooms putrid smell air condition noisy not able to sleep need major overhaul carpets horrible room full of dust and not clean,0
 room and view was lovely,1
 the breakfast choice was wonderful and if you book before the day its only 12 per head the hotel is very close to a tube station on the central line making transport to various locations ideal ,1
 a great place that is stylishly decorated the beds are really comfortable and the shower is fantastic the room we had also featured a lovely little loft with two chairs a desk and a tv the extra space made the place a lot nicer than your standard hotel room ,1
 room was very small even after paying for a privilege room linens including sheets and towels were of the lowest quality view was horrible breakfast wasn t of quality ingredients ,0
 room cold dirty and smelly no minibar no snacks no 24hr roomservice,0
 extremely expensive wifi ridiculous staff were rude and unhelpful ,0

 problematic staff attitudes house keepers and luggage staff very rude and inefficient poor breakfast ,0
 view breakfast no tv remote so couldn t watch ,0
 staff were very friendly and helpful the bed was very comfy and everything very clean ,1
 hotel is having some construction work done this i can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down i thought,0
 the room is old and worn out moreover the bathroom was miserable i have requested from the receptionist to change the room or upgrade and i will afford to pay the difference but unfortunately the hotel is full as the receptionist told me i could hear the person in the room beside snoring had construction in the room above for 2 nights starting at 7 30 am i have complained the first time and they told me it won t happen again and they asked if i would like to change the room for the last night i refused and requested to delay the construction till 9 30 am and off course what i requested didn t happen i contacted the manager and the manager all she could do is provide me with 1 complementary breakfast for the last night very terrible hotel and very terrible costumer service ,0
 no free internet the staff very bad specialy resption staff the bathroom very bad,0
 dirty room pictures were a lie discourteous staff very very expensive not worth of money please stay away from this property hopeless breakfast ,0
 very kind and helpful staff great service 5 ,1
 well it starts from the extremely dry unwelcoming and somewhat rude front desk staff and the non existing concierge i would have at least expected someone to ask me if i needed help with my bags since i had to deal with 5 of them now after checking in we had to wait for around 10 minutes in a somewhat hot reception to get the service elevator since the other 2 are under renovation everytime it stoped it was full of either staff of workers when we finally reached our floor it smelt like a worksite some airfreshners would have been nice the room itself is nice but was located near an emergency exit that woke us up everytime it slammed when closing later that day after comming back from a walk we were then greeted by boxes almost blocking the hallways and minibars on the floors in front of everyroom this was followed by a maintenance person knocking on my door to check if he could install the fridge may i just point out that he must have been the most polite employee i encountered during my stay as he apologized for the mess and inconvenience anyways im glad i only booked this place for one night i understand hotels renovate and need to work around guest but a few smiles some signs in the service hallways and a bit of courtesy doesn t hurt ,0
 the rooms are a disgrace need refurbishing and a good clean,0
 the single room was very small and extremely hot making sleeping difficult i had to change my booking on a non refundable rate and whilst allowing me to change to another date i was charged 50 more despite my reason for change was an unexpected hospital appointment for my wife s cancer seemed mean to me allowing the date change at the same rate was all i was asking ,0
 the smell of corridors,0
 the room was spotless but very small i would have liked it to be a larger room for the rate the hilton up the road was a similar rate for a much larger room the staff were vet friendly and helpful ,1
 location too far from city center no close tube station,0
 room very smelly with air conditioning that only worked occasionally no alternative room available and all i was offered was one complimentary drink not good enough at over 300 a night ,0
 the location was great the hotel had great character and the staff were friendly ,1
 great location for olympia very comfortable beds and friendly staff ,1
 no mini bar in the room no brush teeth the most inportent people they dont stop nok the door for check out from 9am till 12 to insure that we ate linving,0
 elevator not working,0
 location good facilities good location near the subway good neighborhood located next to a nice park ,1
 closeness to metro station and chick appeal of restaurant,1
 bed was awesome,1
 attentive staff,1
 the front desk staff was not welcoming upon arrival but paled in comparison to the rudeness of the front desk reception upon departure the room was not made up during our stay although it appeared at some point a staff member entered the room to leave a madeline which i assumed was part of the turn down service they did not attempt at any other housekeeping interestingly the first night there was no turn down service at all which would have gone unnoticed had the mystery cookie not appeared upon check out the receptionist insisted we wait in a long line at the desk pay the city tax although we showed her proof that it was already paid on booking com also the room was extremely small having stayed in paris quite frequently in a range of hotels this was definitely the smallest room i have ever seen ,0
 i was disgusted with the hotel staff and the way i was treated by them one of the worst hotel experiences of my entire life absolutely appalling ,0
 location and parking,1
 dirty bathroom and sheets,0
 tv cable broken tiny room swimming pool not open needs total refurb ,0
 very bad location small room ,0

 very rude night staff poor service as was not able to sleep because my room was next to a party and had twin beds put together instead of what the page specified as a double bed couldn t sleep and ended up with backache and neck ache worst experience ever never again ,0
 a very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding ,1
 had to change my room 3 times 1st time air condition didn t work then after 2 days in the 2nd room they moved me out problem with water pipe moved me out in a bad way 3rd room air condition didnt work and they didnt care to fix and was tired to even talk to them hotel bar lobby small and the bar most of the time reserved you can t work or have a drink more important people reserved it than you are and no were else to work and you cant sit in the lobby and have a drink even the bar is closed you cant work in the lobby if you open your laptop to work and then you went to stretch your legs or toilet you laptop will disappear with all your stuff a security guard will remove them as its not allowed to leave your stuff in the lobby for more than 30 seconds other wise they will take it and throw it out too expensive for this kind of service so stay away from this hotel also it needs refurbishing tv keeps hanging must plug it on off and small tvs,0
 tiny dark basement room waste water noise broken tap in bathroom woken by someone hiccoughing and knocking on the door at 06 00 hot stuffy small breakfast room with not enough tables poor breakfast,0
 the hotel is really bad total loss of money value ac not working elevator not working and restaurant is smaller than my kitchen and can t take more than 20 guests at the same time very old hotel and very bad,0

 2 single beds pushed together not acceptable for 165 per night rooms tiny and dated decor ,0
 1 the receptionists are not professionals one day before the checkout i have asked the night shift receptionist to proceed with the payment for the reservation the told me that the payment has been taken through booking website at the time of checkout the morning shift receptionist told me that the payment has not been done yet he refused to contact booking com to make sure he kept insisting on paying the reservation regardless to what i told him then he has been trying to join the night shift receptionist by telephone finally the night shift receptionist had responded he claimed that it was a pre authorisation he did not apologise about this mistake i think that the night shift receptionist was not in wood to work so he had fabricated the story of the payment the funny thing is the morning shift receptionist kept saying it is not the problem of the receptionist he did not apologise about the behaviour of his colleague and he refused to give his family name i asked to join the manager he also refused 2 there was no place in the hotel to leave the bagages for a coupel of hours after the checkout because the available room to keep the lagauges was full of covers and blankets 3 the receptionists do not give a damn to whom enter the hotel even at night time so it does not seem secured ,0

 such a beautiful hotel very well located tube very close rooms small but clean and comfy i loved it ,1
 the view was stunning ,1
 the ground floor room was the nosiest i have ever stayed in because of the air conditioning piping and very small our shower was broken and there was not enough towels for 2 people upon entering our room the porter told us that he and hotel staff are usually given this room to stay in never again will i stay at this hotel having stayed at several other double trees this hotel really did not live up to the standard i have seen at sister hotels if you are offered a ground floor room then refuse ,0
 i booked a single deluxe room when i entered the room i was very shocked by the size of the room which was like a shoe box there was no closets in the room and the single bed which they said was a queen size bed which took up the entire room and there was hardly any room to move around the bathroom was very tiny and hard to move around for the rates they are charging like 160 pounds 200 pounds per night the rooms are very much disappointing and later i had to pay additional money to upgrade to a bigger room i will not stay in this hotel anymore a the rooms are tiny and they charge way too much for the rooms it was more like a 2 3 star hotel and radisson brand needs to upgrade the room sizes in this hotel if they want to maintain their standard very much disappointing ,0
 there was no access to movies the wifi required a complicated login tv was too small and outdated too many staff standing around doing nothing no seats of any kind in lobby in usa this room and amenities would be valued at 80 for the night ,0
 easy to reach covent garden soho and city however the hotel is quite far away from westminster room is clean comfy and nicely designed very nice couch good bath,1
 the room safe was broken they were inflexible in either offering a room change or a practical solution one of the purpose to get a hotel was to leave my valuables in the room the entire purpose was lost and i had the stress of carrying my passport jewelry etc all over london also the room was very small ,0
 this is how good the service was i asked a member of the concierge team the quickest route to the greenwich north tube station he kindly quided me to the limousine and drove me to the station ,1
 staff was attentive and jr suite was spacious proximity to paddington station was short walk ,1
 the room is far away too small than we though and the picture shows the facility is old in the room the sink and drainage hole of bathtub broken and worse we change the room more than one time enduring the rest of our staying ,0
 comfort of the room is excellent especiallly the technology sky tv and good quality free wi fi the hotel was quiet within and outside especially if you specify a rear facing room ,1
 staff was rude and unwilling to help with customer service ,0
 toilet bowl was not flushed when i checked into room which spoilt the whole experience ,0
 there was a huge leak in the room it shut down the electricity and ac they had no technician the receptionist tried in vein to fix it with a screw driver he stopped the leak and restored half the power i ended up with no ac and no lights in the bathroom for the duration of my stay it was the hottest night of the year i had a very important meetingh in the morning and couldn t even comb my hair as the bathroom was blacked out no replacement room or any compensation was offered i demand a refund i have used booking com many many times this is the first time i have requested a refund but i must insist or i will have to change to agoda ,0

 hotel close to restaurants tube station hyde park hotel clean and quiet,1
 i booked this hotel for a few people who were on a business trip and the comments on their return would not make me want to book with that hotel again it was very date drab and not particularly clean the rooms were extremely small and cramped one lady couldn t even open the door all the way because the bed was there one person was told they weren t upgraded to one of the better rooms which was what the lady was in and was taken out of the building and along the road to another building this is not the sort of hotel that i would book for a business trip so consider it was not value for money i would definitely not recommend it the website does not show the hotel in it s true light so is very misleading ,0
 i originally booked for four nights and was asked to upgrade to a suite for an extra 30 a night i had to leave after two nights and was charged the full amount for four nights including the suite upgrade complete rip off plus the suite had a tiny bathroom and the air conditioning did not work i won t be staying here again nor using booking com ever again,0

 customer service was appalling,0
 overly soft bed caused my back to spasm leaving me in pain sleeping on the floor a c wasn t working properly even after maintenance by a staff member bath has been built raised up and so i could not gain access or egress without hopping into and out of the bath this is a serious health and safety issue internet wasn t explained when i checked in paper ordered at the same time never arrived not enough staff working on saturday 01 august a day the hotel was full of people like me doing ride london and so despite being out for breakfast for an hour and then out for a further two the room 734 wasn t made up room service tray of another room was left in the corridor for over 12 hours ,0

 breakfast worst in the world for 50 a day per couple heating not working in london during february an you imagine had to talk to 5 people for 2 days before getting a heater on the last and 6th nights there unacceptable if this hotel was in the states they would have jumped for a solution again do not believe the ads ,0
 service was worst as i have ever seen in a hilton property public water has gone for 4 5 hours in the hotel room was ok but the bed was uncomfortable not like a hilton quality standard we stayed 3 person in a room but housekeeping didn t put 3 pairs of towels slippers and toiletries in the room we had to ask for them ,0

 hair in the bath and showerhead mould on ceiling located in an unsafe region of paris ,0
 our lovely room and the friendly yet professional manner of all staff ,1
 beautiful grand building good location next to tube ,1
 location although i had an upgraded room room furniture room facilities room cleanness bathroom,0
 staff were excellent rooms clean good value for money,1
 the staff was just unpleasant the stairs 3 floors with no help from the staff this place is far from any tube station ,0
 i was taken to a room with very small windows facing a construction site i assume all west rooms are facing that construction since noise was getting to the room even with the windows closed i asked to move to another room staff advised me to keep that room since the noise was only from 8 am to 5 pm i kindly insisted and was given another room facing the opposite street i spent four evenings asking to have the air con fixed for four eveneings the hotel said they could solve the problem right away from the reception only to find out by chance that the air con of my room was broken all along and i had been made a fool the rooms facing east have street noise so you must keep the windows closed horrible experience i felt really disrespected as a customer ,0
 couldn t fault the price for the quality and location of this hotel ,1
 the room was amazing shower was the best part of the room ,1
 free chocolate and wine,1
 location suited us and staff were very helpful ,1

 when i book a room in the internet it was looking good but when i get there i was surprised that they gave me the worst room i have even been it is like a prison also i pay a lot for this room what you will in the internet you will not get it in the hotel they try to give you nice looking and luxury but later you will find something totally wrong place ,0
 location view clean and big rooms,1
 room 205 small single room was only as long as the single bed and floor space approx 2 x 6 ensuite tiny but clean room was on a half landing so staircase directly outside bedroom door which meant i could hear everyone coming and going door didn t lock although accessed only on key card wifi signal didn t reach room no mattress protector on bed just a thin sheet with blood stains see photos net curtain was a grubby grey and roman blind was dusty where it hadn t been hoovered for a while head end of bed right next to window so very draughty all night decided not to sample the breakfast after reading reviews so went to euston station instead ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep room was very spacious and had a lovely view from our window staff very polite and friendly outstanding features throughout the hotel very pleased ,1
 staff always extremely helpful,1
 overall this hotel is very tired and in need of refurbishment bedroom bathroom facilities are meagre and basic for a hotel of this stature restaurant reflects the same feeling that this hotel is no more than a very large cheap bed breakfast ,0
 the building was beautiful full of character it was clean and current,1
 bed wasn t extra comfy room temperature was adjustable the view from the room looking towards the thames was amazing the staff were highly professional and friendly the spa was great with good facilities ,1
 cleaning staff too loud,0

 great location very friendly staff ,1
 took hours for room service and is more of a 3 star hotel,0
 the staff,1
 terrible renovation of a beautiful older home into what they consider a trendy chelsea hotel small rooms very little hanging space for clothes mickey mouse washroom could have had better selection for breakfast disappointed overall ,0
 bad security ,0
 convienent location on the picadilly line gives you direct access to heathrow coventry garden and leicester square just a few blocks from the british museum we had booked a superior room but were informed prior to arrival that due to renovations it would not be available provided us with a rebate for downgrading to a standard room and gave us free breakfast the room we got was much bigger than we expected which was a pleasant surprise the staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay the breakfast was great although i don t know if i would spend the 19 50 per person if it was not included ,1
 the worst bathrooms ever small rooms very small tv with limited chanel dengerous area,0
 my bags where stolen in the hotel lobby when i ask them to see the recording camera try told me it was not working ,0
 the staff didn t do any thing i ve requested for example when the first time i arrived i found no facilities on the tv movies then i told them that no movies on the tv and since that time and i m every day request the same from the staff and i found no response till the checkout also their was a leeks in side the bathroom after all this hotel doesn t worth 5 star 3 is fair,0
 very nice location near hyde park perfect for runners close to the tube station very nice atmosphere in the lobby ,1
 bad services particularly by night as the concierge was very rude and unhelpful rooms are very small and not comfortable the kinky decoration is ok but doesn t present any interest very bad hotel and bad experience overall,0
 ordered delux room was upgraded to basement too noisy walls and windows paper thin room was next to kitchen could hear staff shouting and laughing at crack of dawn when preparing for breakfast heating cannot be controlled from that room have to phone reception bed was tiny ,0
 the place is under renovation there is no parking space for my car on site i had to park my car in a different hotel and walk three to four blocks back urine smell in the rooms,0
 bed was hard damp smell carpets in very bad condition pool and sauna small and had kids swimming lessons going on dirty scum marks around top off pool ,0
 everything they tried to send us to another hotel we also heard them say this to three other people however because we made a fuss they miraculously found a room it was tiny bashed about the air conditioning didn t work bed was 4ft not double my husband had to climb over me to get out of bed the shower leaked and tv had terrible signal we were moved the next day to a club room which was adequate we paid for a deluxe room it wasn t even the club room was basic the bedrooms need a complete makeover and generally better customer service the staff don t acknowledge you when you walk through the reception we never complain but feel that the hotel s poor standards put a real damper on our weekend away and people may like to know that they could try to move you to a different hotel if possible we think it may be in case of footfall bookings ,0
 location is perfect nice view spacious room shower and bath being italian i was very happy to find a nespresso machine as well ,1
 location,1
 i asked for a double and got a twin the lady wouldn t change are doin the parking took forever as spaces were to small to fit a car the prices for drink was way over priced the room was boiling even with window open and was risky awaken by cleaners in the morning and was way overpriced for the wrong room in the first place,0
 almost everything the hotel needs an urgent renewal the furniture were super old and they were in bad state the bathrooms belong to other times and the carpet was old and full of dust besides all the doors made of wood were totally scratchy the communal rooms and swimming pool were always crowded and to be honest taking into account the state of the rest of the hotel we didn t dare to go into the swimming pool besides the communication with the rest of the city is not the best one ,0
 having stayed in five star hotels in london before i can honestly say this was along side them it was a truly memorable stay with great facilities ,1
 room stank of sewage bedroom v small lift access slow,0
 i loved it all,1
 camere con vista london eye e big ben,1
 pool free wifi,1
 great location,1
 unresponsive ness of staff especially front desk staff on some occasions calls to the reception are not picked the front desk staff apart from one lady that is a manager are unmoved and certainly unwilling to assist for eg i almost missed my flight because i was at the reception begging them to detail a staff to help me with my luggage as i was checking out they just mopped at me helplessly i was forced to take a trolley to my room and started carrying my luggage contrary to my doctors advise i have been in pains since then ,0

 very clean and central hotel heart of london friendly staff and comfortable rooms excellent for a family ,1
 room was tiny not as advertised tv was tiny and obscured by the door carpet was dirty just a typically overpriced hotel based upon location no food facilities no bar or available refreshments very disappointed,0
 the amazing staff especially razan so accommodating helpful and efficient ,1
 rooms are too small and need investment,0
 excellent location nicely appointed small rooms but very well laid out staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 the so called superior double room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated club room and not a superior room also we checked in at 11 00 hr and returned at 23 15 hr to be told that there was a minimum of a 1 hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available we also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered ,0
 clean comfy and a great location for us ,1
 i am a very frequent hotel user and a reputable operator such as the mellinium should be of a much better standard location of the hotel was excellent staff were inexperienced they were charging multiple credit card authoritiions wrongfuly and charged payment for room one day prior to checkout without our consent housekeeping was poor on different levels ,0
 dirty staffs no smile ac was crazy,0
 i ve been bite by spider more than 30 times beds are really dirty ,0
 the bedroom was very small and was only just a single not double as booked the bed was extremely uncomfortable and left no space to move around there was an issue with check in where the room we were booked into was not ready and so we were put into the small room i was asked for my passport which confused me as i am english the receptionist gave us the barest of information referring to a scrap of paper trains were passing the room so could not have the window open due to excessive noise ,0
 great location nice and quiet inside well equipped room good wifi ,1

 no place to move in the room less space then in a prison,0
 they dont make up the room and they take 2 hours to bring your order from the room service,0
 the loacation is very good ,1
 we arrived at the hotel and was checked in quickly by one of the lovely staff our room was on the 6th floor and we had an amazing view of river thames and the o2 we returned from the event at the o2 and ordered room service and the steak and chunky fries was so delicious the bed is one of the most comfortable beds that i ve slept on ,1
 excellent location a lovely outside terrace where you could sit and have a drink or eat breakfast in the sunshine would definitely come back,1
 staff were somewhat rude entered the hotel through the cafe which is a bit off putting breakfast was abysmal small rooms,0
 everything was great except that the shower door only went half way across so water went onto the floor they let us check in early which was great nice tv decent wifi new looking rooms ,1
 property is substandard furniture is very bad for every small thing we had to phone and ask like tea bags soap etc worst thing was plastic tumblers for drinking water ward robe door was broken ,0
 everything perfect ,1
 appalling housekeeping we waited in vain for a rotten pear to be removed from the fruit basket bathroom was not properly cleaned e g watermarks on basin surround not removed we could not sleep due to the rattles in the air conditioning,0
 bed very uncomfortable making a squeaky noise each time we moved one out of our 3 rooms was double booked which forced our other family to crash on a sofa of a friend that stayed 30 minutes from the hotel we were devastated with being separated and our week end being ruined very arrogant management with no customer skills,0
 breakfast was very nice ,1
 the staff was extremely friendly it was my birthday so i got a room upgrade bottle of wine and a bday card and balloons in my room amazing location too ,1
 location and overall cleanliness,1
 service was terrible had to order drinks from room and then bring down to lobby ourselves disgusted with attitude of some staff parking was free outside and was encouraged to purchase 37 00 overnight parking ticket which i then stopped soon as i wa told by kind security staff ,0
 good shower and toiletries air conditioning big window and pleasant outlook towels and sheets clean and good quality apples available at reception iron available from reception desk ,1
 very good service beautiful place location was superb ,1
 excellent property no matter what the reason your stay in london if you wanted to be close to many of the tourist sites this is the place the life of the city this is the place and in walking distance ,1
 a well situated clean and comfortable hotel ,1
 1 the staffs of hotel are not kind and smooth to check in out 2 authorized attitude to customer and laughing between staffs using the other language as i check in out 3 i will never stay here,0
 bad location no parking space available staff not friendly small elevator ,0
 the internet is very very slow you can t upload or download any images the room is very very small not like the pictures there is no lift,0
 on arriving at the hotel reception advised due to booking com there had been an over booking and that they had organised a room for me at an adjacent hotel the hotel was satisfactory but not to the same standard as the pictures of the norfolk towers hotel would indicate very dissapointed to be messed around like this ,0
 about the staff,0
 rooms very small extremely noisy from the road and doors banging into the early hours of the morning no bar or lounge and dining room not big enough to accommodate all guests at breakfast breakfast also very very early only available until 9am ,0
 pictures on booking com left much to be desired the room was very small and very poorly cleaned definitely not worth the value if you like a nice bed and clean facilities look elsewhere the staff was also quite rude and unwelcomeing ,0
 the breakfast that we had to make up for being sent somewhere else,1
 perfect stay lovely staff ,1
 the staff were extremely friendly the location was good the hotel as a whole was excellent the facilities were superb ,1
 the hotel needs total renovation everything was out of date the bathroom was tiny and really bad smell the staff young and not professional ,0
 amenities are great big ben and westminster abbey are within 10 mins walk ,1
 the staff and the communication was very bad the rooms was not clean properly and still had rubbish from the last guest ,0
 very convenient location and very welcoming staff ,1
 it was central for 2 get where you wanted 2 be it was nice clean staff were helpful polite ,1
 the hotel faces a nice small park with a number of good cafes and restaurants alongside ,1
 unfriendly unhelpful staff,0
 finding yourself in a room with one window that overlooks the indoor swimming pool where a large number of children are understandably playing noisily and where there is no mobile phone signal is not what i expect for a business booking then to be advised that there are no alternative rooms but later a different view is given to booking com and i am accused of requesting an upgrade that i had never asked for and when seeking to cancel and get a refund that was refused that wasn t a great experience ,0
 bed great,1
 they want a payment for room service even though i didn t need it so i had to pay 30 in advanced for smth i didn t use the food was really bad the vegetables not cooked at all the room very cold and noisy the hotel was very old and not renovated really bad quality price,0
 the bed was amazing close to bercy train station which we needed staff throughout the complex amazingly friendly and helpful ,1
 dirty uncomfortable and useless staff,0
 there was construction going on all around the hotel when i arrived the staff felt like they didn t really acknowledge me at all when i arrived and were far too busy in conversation with each other the room itself stank of dampness and smoke and the corridors we literally taped up with water running down the walls overall a very poor experience will not be returning ,0
 they changed the price when we arrived,0
 rooms are tooo small as well as toilets the room was for 2 adults but the bed us acually for one person as it tooo small ,0
 hotel is very central we had a room with a view of big ben and the london eye lovely bar area and decent food we went for our anniversary and the staff made a real fuss of us they d left us a bottle of wine and a card in the room when we arrived ,1
 everything was amazing the decoration the room the bed the staff we are very happy to have found this hotel and we will recommend it to all of our friends ,1
 the front reception was available only one person with many people waiting thing gone wrong a lot with unacceptable services,0
 never slept all night noise and vibration from exterior air con units spent most of night walking the streets,0
 poor welcome very week wifi bad room service basically it was bad experience at that hotel ,0
 staff were welcoming and friendly,1
 staff couldn t do enough the hotel felt like a home and the breakfast was superb the location was perfect and the stay was best value i have ever had ,1
 shabby even dirty in places the room had a terrible stale smell sold as a suite i ve paid less for doubles that have been bigger toilet bathroom door arrangement ridiculous ordered one bowl of chips on room service and waited an hour to be brought a bowl of crisps ,0
 only one lift in the hotel and only one man for the luggage,0
 great location just round the corner from earls court station easy access to all main attractions comfy room breakfast excellent choice staff very friendly would definately stay again on our next trip to london ,1
 after a booking glitch i was made to pay for a night even when they had a week to rebook the room not customer friendly and very greedy most of the fittings in the bathroom needed maintenance don t have happy memories of the experience,0
 definitely not a 5 star hotel in room wifi didn t work room was noisy and very basic amenities and d cor staff weren t particularly helpful or interested ,0
 brilliant room layout king studio,1
 spacious affordable,1
 the staff were very polite and courteous and made us feel very welcome they wrote a happy birthday message on the window of our suite as it was my wife s 50th birthday she was very touched by this ,1
 at check in was told the hotel had moved client to an annex room was very very noisy heard water all night sounds from adjacent rooms and rooms overhead terrible experience ,0
 good breakfast location,1
 modern and upgraded,1
 helpful and friendly staff food was extremely good room was clean and comfortable ,1
 you booked us in as a couple and not as a couple with a young child no bed booked for our daughter she had to keep with us otherwise we were on the street staff ther were awful ,0
 the hotel had a weird smell,0
 it was a great location clean and friendly staff breakfast was good value too ,1
 room allocation not as requested,0
 the bedroom was spacious and comfortable particularly impressed with the bathroom that had a good sized bath and separate shower cubicle my daughter wanted to take home the pillows and duvet as she said it was so comfortable room had a good view out over the thames it was good to have the dedicated route into the o2 which definitely saved time ,1
 in terms of value for money this is one of the worst hotels i ve stayed in ,0
 loca ia,1
 horrific i stay in london every week in 4 or 5 star hotels this isn t a 3 star in my opinion dirty dated and grubby shame for such a beautiful building ,0
 junior suite was nice would have prepared bath great shower was nice and clean ,1
 the air conditioner was broken the building was incredibly hot it wasn t worth the money at all ,0
 the air ventilator made noise all night we told the reception but no one bothered to come and check ,0
 great location few steps to underground lots of food and there is a coop shop aldo,1
 breakfast included but they offer you just the continental breakfast very poor and they prepare in another table the english breakfast eggs bacon salad etc but you have to pay for that no sense all peopole just had the continental one with disappointment elevetor they didn t repair the elevetor so you have to do 3 floors of stairs with your luggage they don t offer you help be careful at the rooms under the level of the street they are very noise i don t suggest more for the service than for the structure that could be good,0
 heating on constantly in room room too warm giving humidifiers in room but couldn t sleep with the noise ,0
 friendliness of staff who went above and beyond to make the hotel feel like home ,1
 very comfortable and clean room balcony was a little plus ,1
 when we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels 15 minutes away the boiler had broken in the hotel they did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem they also had us sign a paper committing us to full 4 night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move we were then transported at 11 p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full 4 night stay without inspection of the room or area at that hour we had no choice but to make the payment we were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a 20 minute rail ride away we asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request we called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels we then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location around 1 p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel although i was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the 2nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an 11 year old child the room was tiny much much smaller than most small european rooms worse yet it was filthy dirty the carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled the courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside we have pictures to support this description it was shocking that we were not released from the reservation we have used booking com in the past but never again they should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment ,0
 stains on the bed dust on the above bed curtain and window curtain musty heavy odour in the whole room and across hotel s corridor ,0
 very comfy beds and helpful staff easy walk to the tube station price we secured was very good access to computers and printers very helpful ,1
 need 24h room service no cleaners after 4pm meaning if u need clean laundry and etc you will have to do it yourself hotel has no facilities other than breakfast lounge which is very small with no variety overall this is a 2 hotel at best ,0
 the location very close to hyde park for pleasant walking and to queensway tube station for the underground s central line to oxford street and shopping and local restaurants shopping etc and notting hill gate ditto,1
 room was very smelly some of staff were not friendly and helpful ,0
 no breakfast available internet just too slow impossible to download file from email lobby to small room too small clearly not a 4 stars,0
 single rooms are very small blocking money from credit card and not returning it ,0
 location,1
 excellent location can walk to many tourist attractions metro near by only 45 mins from charles de gaulle airport beautiful park near by and very helpful staff,1
 location central period features nice bathroom with a bath friendly staff,1
 i like the quality of service room decoration staff was friendly moreover they provided me storage option which was very comfortable specially if you have trains to heathrow overall i had a great experience staying there ,1
 the staff was very rude and we booked the room through booking com when we reached there they didn t provide us with a room which was unacceptable,0
 the staff was very friendly and accommodating the location was,1
 french staff dun speak english not helpful the lamp was out of order no one fix it for four days not very clean room ,0
 reservation staff awful reception didn t know what was going on beds were uncomfortable rock solid ,0
 most of the stay,0
 the location very helpful staff,1
 great location and breakfast,1
 the staff doesn t know much about how to move around in london eg we want to go to majesty theatre at west end the don t know how to go and which train station to alight how much the train cost am surprised as west end is a populate place in london ,0
 this hotel was fantastic i even asked for a large mug as i drink lots of herbal tea they found one in staff room the location is first class amble down qeensway early evening very eclectic and vibrant we seen every sight there is to see and more within a 5 to 25 tube ride gave us an upgrade as we were on honeymoon now please remember its bang in the centre of the area you need to be i have seen comments about room sizes being to small remember it s central london the room was great shower brilliant a large head shower can t say enough good things about the property or staff 5 plus the decor stunning i am in the travel industry this is the best at the best you will find so read this then hit book no money upfront either in case your itinerary changes thank you for a wonderful 5 days oh buy an oyster card 6 60 per day unlimited travel tubes and buses ,1

 never again ,0
 absolutely loved this place everything was perfect location staff very helpful facilities spacious room massive choice for breakfast would love to bring the family back with us ,1
 this is the first time booking com have let me down this is not worth the money i paid 290 for a standard room for 1 night is a joke when the next night was on offer for 67 and then up to 147 the next day just because a concert was on awful hotel dirty smelly fusty room aircon broke 32degrees outside windows in breakfast finger prints all over staff at breakfast very rude i arrived at 9 50am and half the place was closed off nobody to greet me show me where to sit couldnt find table with cutlery or cups got hot breakfast sat it at table to get toast and fruit time i got to fruit area was 10 01am gone taken away staff hovered over waiting on my plate to whisk it away complained at reception to no avail ,0
 the hotel was under renovation so the first floor was not accessible felt restricted to my room the carpet in my room was freshly washed and still wet i asked to move and was told they were fully booked went online and found availability i was eventually moved the room service food was awful but to be fair i only had one meal ,0
 good value,1
 great staff quiet room ,1
 mice running everywhere my bed was two twin beds pushed together room was overheated,0
 room was good and comfortable shower was great food was very good ,1
 everything a1,1
 we arrived at 1 am and there were no rooms available yet we mentioned that we will arrive late,0
 this particular room is next to the generator which keeps you awake all night i am not sure it s possible to sleep in this room i had a similar one here before i asked the receptionist how i could make a complaint about it she said she would raise to manager but i have yet to hear anything back ,0
 we were put in annex at the back of hotel,0
 for the price we pay we didn t get much small room compared to the pictures hallways are dark and creepy feels like you are the only one staying there you can hear noises thru the walls especially when maids are cleaning rooms on certain nights you can hear restaurant music thru thin window glass tiny bathrooms stinky elevators 6 for bottle of water no thank you ,0
 location to o2 beds breakfast and the bedroom view friendly atmosphere and a great nights sleep easy access to the tube into town in the morning only a 5 minute walk ,1
 the room was on the basement and had no natural light only a window that lead to a covered patio full of garbage they offered us to change the room on the last night but we refused because the packing and unpacking would interfere with our plans although the heaters were disconnected the heat was unbearable and we had to sleep with the window opened in the middle of december we couldn t sleep after our upstairs neighbors woke up because of the sound and trembling provoked by the footsteps i m not even sure if the ceiling is in a safe condition although it claims to be a 4 star hotel the room didn t have a minibar or even a safe ,0
 the whole hotel needs to be modernized or the rates reduced much much more our entire floor smelled of cigarette smoke we left after 1 night of our 3 night stay ,0
 clearness money value of the rooms will not recommend the hotel to any ,0
 rooms where tiny beds very uncomfortable rooms where unbearably hot and breakfast was inedible sausages where full of crushed bone,0
 great position comfortable room well insulated from noise nespresso coffee machine a nice touch,1
 the room was comfy the location great and the staff friendly and polite ,1
 we were upgraded upon arrival staff were incredibly friendly helpful and professional the room was very clean and comfortable and convinient to the apollo we will use again and recommend ,1
 upgrade and one free drink each,1
 had a non smoking room but room smelt of cigarette smoke partner is registered disabled with a paralysed left we were therefore surprised to be charged full rates for parking so wont be using this place again ,0
 the front staff service nobody behind front desk at times anyone can walk in from the street hotel seems very lonely and desolate the construction infront of the hotel was an eye sore i checked out 1 day early and they still charged me still waiting to hear from the manager,0
 the room was small but clean and comfortable the staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was very good with traditional english breakfast food the hotel was conveniently located near waterloo train station westminster via a short walk over westminster bridge as well as the london eye and numerous restaurants coffee shops and pubs the gym facilities were very nice with the added bonus of a sauna and steam room the concierge and bell man services were very helpful and professional ,1
 you are paying for the location obviously convenient for the 02 and well worth as a one off treat ,1
 location was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful we ll definitely be back ,1
 horribly overpriced tired dingy bedroom slow lift before going to the bedroom i was that i had been upgraded unbelievably small room rubbish shower,0
 our room was much more stylish than most hotels in the paddington area we were moved from a hotel down the street because of problems with the hot water but the alternative was great the staff at the hotel was amazing and we really felt welcome and we would definitely recommend a stay here ,1
 the beds were georgeous and have never slept so well the lady on reception was so nice and even organized an upgrade and cake when she found out it was my daughters birthday staff were very attentive ,1
 the air conditioning did not work we complained this on the first day they refused to repair it they refused to give us another room they refused to give us any kind of compensation very small rooms even the higher categories size of rooms not mentioned on room descriptions,0
 the hotel is situated in the worst area of paris as the black cab driver i used from outside the station informed me as he charged me five times the going rate for dropping me there the kube hotel is situated up a dirty side round with timber boarding across the front in the day and 3 4 doorman in the evening the ice bar in the hotel looks nothing like the advert on their website ,0
 friendly staff comfortable bed good breakfast ,1
 excellent hotel great staff beautiful room excellent facilities loved it absolute luxury ,1
 helpful spacious even with very large group,1
 almost everything i was very disappointed the pictures on booking com were very different from the actual rooms rooms are old incredibly small i had to choose between using the bed to open my bag or sleep in it there was no room to open my travel bag i ve travelled to 53 countries so far and been to hundreds of hotels around the world this hotel does not deserve 4 stars staff dont speak good english and are not that much helpful the stairs in the room the amenities everything is below what u find in 2 stars in other places highly not recommended ,0
 tiny room lumpy bed very uncomfortable ,0
 the bed was great and comfortable value for money is great for paris hotels this is a newly renovated hotel and it was great,1
 location is ideal for the appollo and it is clean ,1
 having to cross a busy road to get to our room noise level outside room paying 20 for breakfast which was abysmal inedible paying out extra money for breakfast elsewhere checking out was not very professional overall would not recommend this hotel at all ,0
 very close to the o2 arena and greenwich north tube station spacious room large bathroom ,1
 in fairness the amount paid for the room type was no better than a travel lodge or premier inn in fact i would go as far to say the 2 mentioned have better bathroom facilities and sized bedroom,0
 felt more like a motel than a hotel a single check in person not a welcoming lobby no restaurant or room service no conditioner or lotion in the bathroom felt a bit cramped ,0
 friendly attentive staff makes all the difference ,1
 the bathroom ,1
 happy friendly staff ,1
 room was awful constant buzzing air con room was dark and cramped booked a luxury deluxe but the room felt like a standard no iron in the room overall bad experience ,0
 h tel very hold hotel its look like 2 starts small room bathroom dirty not functional ploukistan hotel ,0
 staff very helpful and friendly great customer care excellent breakfasts ,1
 very nice bar and restaurant staff is nice and helpful ,1
 big gap between entrance door and floor so noise travels in corridor also windows need to be more sound proof,0
 the staff really do go that extra mile from the second you arrive the food is fantastic especially the english breakfast we regularly stay and have never been disappointed the family rooms are very spacious which helps when you have cots prams to fit in we find the location great for walking to various museums parks restaurants the area around the hotel has a really nice vibe we always manage to find a family friendly little cafe or shop that our boys will want to go back to again and again ,1
 everything was class from the staff to the rooms ,1
 very helpful staff,1
 the place was immaculately clean the staff was friendly and went the extra mile to make us feel welcome we would not hesitate to book again ,1
 lovely room ,1
 black decorations tiny lobby poor breakfast variety small room staff with no experience the location the hotel from outside doesn t look like a hotel definitely i would never come back again ,0
 lovely room friendly staff ,1
 location,1
 the room was so small i mean it i know there are standards in hospitality industry it is unethical to put deluxe double room on the website and put people in a capsule ,0
 everything feel ripped off ,0
 this was a very modern and high tech hotel very comfortable bed and easy access to greenwich and london as well the staff restaurants and bars were excellent ,1
 not informed of building works ,0
 breakfast in room perfectly cooked and very hot ,1
 the first room was a complimentary upgrade to a triple room which was down in the basement next to a fire exit workers entrance and smoking hiding spot and in the first 5 minutes of being there 4 people came crashing through the fire exit door you know the one that should remain closed i asked if we could be moved and the only room available was opposite the elevator and hotel entrance that s right you here the door open then 30seconds later ping going up this room also had blood on the walls half the lights did not work and the curtain rail was broken letting a bright beam of light through from the main entrance across the bed where your head lies now i then checked their website and they are advertising deluxe double rooms for that evening at half the price with a free breakfast the rooms are small that is well documented however if you are 6ft or above like myself good luck fitting in the shower this place is definitely not worth the money oh and both booking com and the hotel fail to inform you that there building work being carried out from 8am 6pm ,0
 we checked in we were given a room in the gatehouse section of the hotel now i know the hotel was not busy it was boxing day and only one other guests car in the car park yet we were dumped in the cold damp section of the hotel probably best only used for the busy summer tourist season the wallpaper was splitting at the seams and peeling from the wall there were cracks all over the ceiling the bathroom although recently refitted was obviously done by cheap unskilled labour i could press the large tiles under the mirror and they would bow and flex into the void behind them though i did not do this too much as i feared the large mirror would come crashing down the grouting was terrible too or even completely missing the small wooden threshold bordering the bedroom carpet to the bathroom tiles was bowed so every time i stood on it it would flatten down leaving the nail head to stick up very nice for when you walk into the bathroom barefooted but most of all it was cold and damp we stayed in the room an hour and a half but we could not get heat into the room and were not only not satisfied i was annoyed at being mugged off i complained and one of the ladies on the desk seemed a little snobby to start with though she did show us two rooms inside the main building and eventually gave us a free upgrade to a superior room which was warm and comfortable and well decorated but why do hotel do this i thought it was just me but the more people i talk to this seems common practice to give out the crappy rooms first the second lady on reception even admitted she did not like the gatehouse room when she helped us with our luggage yet she was the one who had initially booked us in and chose the room i have a rule now if i have to complain about the room i never use the hotel again the other thing though minor compared to the room is they have no hot breakfast just a continental breakfast ,0
 tiniest room terrible amenities not worth the money ,0
 location of the hotel,1
 the welcome from the staff as soon as you walked into the hotel was great and the overall look of the hotel was welcoming as well ,1
 located just above the bar thumping music until midnight lots of loud people noise the room so tiny no space for a table or small chair had to store work items in bathroom terrible food not well staffed only one person at desk and often not even there so no service or help with bags ,0
 good central location and good helpful welcoming staff nearby restaurants ,1
 the room was very small the decor was old and not well maintained nobody except the receptionist spoke english the location is not close to any major attractions and it s a considerable walk away from any metro station as well ,0
 very neat nice and comfortable ,1
 location was great,1
 the hotel was excellent with well trained staff good food and well appointed rooms the stay was too short to test the facilities ,1
 the room was expensive small unattractive the bed was queen size not even a double low ceilings all in all very disappointing given what we paid for it ,0
 had to call the bar every time we wanted ice bathroom had mold in the shower asked for business office and the computers didn t work ,0
 the is a lot to like at one aldwych the room was large comfortable and well appointed the staff are corteous helpful efficient and cheerful the private lounge available to guests for use after check out is a nice touch that in our case made a late evening flight much more relaxing there were many small touches too many to mention here that added to an aleady excellent atmoshpere and the location is excellent ,1
 i booked a triple room the room is quiet large and has a balcony the location is really nice near the paddinton station just about 5 minutes walk and hyde park the staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need i order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice i will definitely choose this hotel again when i go to london next time ,1
 the worst hotel i have ever experienced in my life the room the spa the food quite unbelievable that a hotel like this can stay open the owners should be ashamed of themselves ,0
 great breakfast friendly and helpful staff comfy firm bed fab location for transport links and access to londons parks shopping ,1
 excellent central location helpful friendly staff and very comfortable beds we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely stay at the select again ,1
 the mini kitchen bar,1
 i am pretty sure this place is run by children ,0
 really clean and modern quick check in and check out ,1
 location shower was good,1
 the room we had was tiny but after complaining we were moved to a larger room directly above the bar which had a squeaky sign hanging outside the window our first room didn t have a remote for the tv and our second room we were too far away from the tv for it to work the first room had a faulty shower and lighting system and the second bathroom was so big it echoed would i stay here again never i would rather stay in a tent on wimbledon common ,0
 location,1
 very nice comfy beds lovely staff lovely pool and spa area really enjoyed my stay nice views watching all the fireworks going off on new year s eve ,1
 staff was helpful breakfast at hotel is nice hotel is old and we liked that ,1
 the rooms ,0
 friendly staff clean and quiet room lovely food all in all a great stay,1
 i stayed in the hotel for 2 days the heater in room did not worked for both days despite complaining about it since first day due to this i had clod and flu the room is very very small and there is no space to even stand in the room wifi signals were too weak and room was very dusty ,0
 we were not appreciative of the high cost of the breakfasts that the room was so small that while it could not take a full sized double bed you still had difficulty walking round it that the lift seemed to be in the wardrobe and so was noisy that the windows were floor to ceiling so the only way to get privacy was to draw the curtains so the room was then in darkness and that there was a bus stop immediately outside ,0
 no real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one bit confusing secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to amsterdam ,1
 hotel s location is the best thing top floor city view is breathtaking on a good sunny day near to 2 train stations luxembourg gardens 10 min walk latin quarter eateries 15 mins walk notre dom 15 min walk ,1
 excellent breakfast,1
 absolutely fantastic place to stay me and my partner didn t want to leave the service was amazing so friendly and willing to help in any way to make your stay that much better we stayed here because we were going to a concert at the o2 and loved the fact that you could walk straight in from the hotel the bedroom was lovely very high end finish and could tell that your comfort was top priority when it was designed and built talking about comfort the bed was the best iv slept in and when i got home my own bed felt inadequate will 100 be staying here on my next visit to london ,1
 rated as 4 to 5 star hotel yet can t possibly be more than a 3 very small room and bathroom particularly yet called a premier room spa very substandard as is gym with often wet floors and no towels far too many other issues which we reported to management we would never stay here again ,0
 very noisy and disturbed my stay in sofitel,0
 paid the room at the start of the week when checking in another 100 was taking and we were not made aware of this it was later explained when i asked about it the next day my bank ring fenced the payment so i was 200 down and not told i explained i had bank charges because they did not have me sign anything upon checking or even explain the process first room given was not what i paid for it was not until i raised a complaint they changed this ,0
 first night terrible given a no aircon room 216 and next day changed room to 877 but additional fee of gbp40 ,0
 food so bad the furniture scratched and very dirty wifi suck and not free room too small towels is too consumed,0
 the assistance of arnor was a real pleasure throughout the staff at the front desk were also very pleasant ,1
 bed extra comfy room great temperature staff very helpful ,1
 i asked for the toilet to be fixed at 8am by the time of checkout at 12 it had not i had to use a communal toilet in the meantime which was extremely frustrating,0
 neat and tidy,1
 everything,0
 room inside is dirty,0
 good breakfast free wi fi good bar lovely room with a nice view to the hotel s garden great bathroom with a very good shower excellent location,1
 it s a very new property ,1
 despite the agreement with the travel agent about charging his credit card the hotel charged the client for the stay ,0
 view was fantastic staff very friendly ,1
 old need renovation ,0
 very clean great location,1
 the balcony was never cleaned in the 5 days we were there the first day coffee and tea were left including water but as the week went on they became less and less the carpet wasn t hoovered only 1 chair the wifi was rubbish and we only managed to connect on the last day no information pack at all nothing to guide you the rates should include the buffet breakfast the reception staff were not overly friendly and appear very aloof for a brand new hotel there are many things they need to sort out before i would even think about going back ,0
 we went for my husband s 40th birthday the manager kindly arranged for a complimentary birthday card and beautifully wrapped box of chocolates to be left in the room for a fee they sprinkled rose petals from the door to the bed where they put the petals in the shape of a heart there were more around the bath too a lovely extra touch we were given a free upgrade too without even asking the staff couldn t do enough to help they even gave us a second free duck as we said we had two children the room was really clean and modern bed extra comfy shower fantastic the details of elemis toiletries and free jelly beans and pringles were an excellent bonus i cannot fault it and would definitely stay again location is excellent close to blackfriars tube station excellent excellent excellent ,1
 not a five star hotel in my opinion,0
 i m afraid our weekend trip to london was rather spoilt in the end by the hoxton hotel my wife inadvertantly left her kindle in the room upon check out within hours she realised and we were able to alert housekeeping who had promptly cleaned our room but had not found the 7inch x 5 inch tablet my wife and kindle remain un united be warned ,0
 everything fantastic ,1
 as a regular hotel user or guest i would strongly suggest you avoid booking this hotel unless you are confident everything will run smoothly which as we all know it s not always the case and things do go wrong sometimes the staff are simply rude and disengaged regarding any issues you have been warned ,0
 great location walking distance from paddington station and lots of dining options nearby safe and secure area few mins walk to hop on hop off busses hyde park is 15 mins walk away staff were all helpful ,1
 poor location poor breakfast and service at breakfast,0
 overall i d highly recommend this hotel especially for those coming into waterloo with a young family fab upgrade to a penthouse fantastic views and very kind and helpful front desk staff children made very welcome ,1
 booked a double deluxe room and i was given a single room and very noisy,0
 the staff to arogan especially ms ike duty manager she is look bossy and doesn t need customer ,0
 upgraded us because it was my partners birthday,1
 staff location,1
 great staff especially trainee consiage,1
 there was three of us staying in the same room and the receptionist let us all pay our own share which made it easier,1
 the staff were unfriendly and the hotel is getting very old for a 4 star and highly rated expensive hotel in chelsea ,0
 we were given a room which was in a very old part of the hotel the furnishings were tired and shabby with broken drawers missing handles chipped edges and dilapidated armchair a small dirty georgian sash window framed a view of a dirty entrance portico below we won t be back perhaps they stick the booking com customers in this part of the hotel ,0
 toilet not draining the water through out bathtub not available need cooler air conditioning and more facilities such as fridge bath shoes new bottle of mineral water ,0
 i liked the comfortable bed and the small bottles of wine in the room on the first day the staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them they took the trouble to show interest in what our plans were during our stay ,1
 nothing,0
 clean well maintained hotel and helpful staff ,1
 the staff were very helpful welcoming the room was clean and well equipped the location is perfect and the hotel itself is very comfortable and stylish ,1
 the room was small with damaged and marred antique furniture definitely not hyatt standard ,0
 the staff is worse and cleaners take time to come the treatment was worse the other manager was fantastic but no ,0
 service horrible pas aimables ils entrent dans la chambre ou frappent meme avec le do not disturb chambres tres bruyantes et odeurs dans la salle de bain awful serice at this hotel really noisy you can ear the coffee machine from your neighbours and also what they do in their bed the bathroom smells awful the crew knock at your door anytime even when you put the do not disturb and they also enter to your room even if you mention do no disturb and nothing to fix all of that ,0
 everything else,0
 we waited a good 5 mins at reception with no one there despite ringing the bell 3 times my room g2 was a cabin i could touch the walls with my arms outstretched i m just under 6 foot tall my feet were hanging off the bottom of the bed my head almost touched the shower head the view outside was of some old sofas and an aluminium ladder dumped outside it was right next to the extractor fans so i was woken by those starting at 0700hrs and then everyone having to walk past my door to get downstairs to the breakfast room i know the rate is only 75 night but these days that can get you a decent premier inn not impressed ,0
 i don t know who gave such high value to this hotel i booked it just because i saw the reviews but when i checked in i felt so desperate the room is super small even no room to open our baggage the bathroom door is just 20cm to the bed nothing near the hotel we need to walk like 10 mins to find a small store really disappointed ,0
 great friendly staff,1
 location was just excellent staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for paris really very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting paris again ,1
 the room was very small on the booking info it is written the superior room has 14 m2 that was so not true the room had 10 5 m2 bathroom included when i have raised the issue with the hotel personnel and i said i want to speak to the manager they said they can offer another room but was basically the same size the manager never showed up and they never answered to the email i sent them the room was not clean i found hair in the bed and the floor was super dirty as well as the closet there are 3 rooms on a very small corridor you can hear everything from the other rooms definetely i will not go there ever based on my own experience i don t recommend this hotel the hotel is close to the metro trocadero but it is not a nice neighbourhood to walk in the evenings very dirty street vendors all over the area in clonclusion not a good experience ,0
 i took my students to that hotel and it was great very well located with plenty of affordable restaurants two good grocery stores and access to the subway system with two easy access to it there were lots of staff to assist you they were courteous and doing their best to accommodate our needs i will certainly go back again next time i have to stop in london ,1
 location was excellent rooms were nice and the bed was lovely staff were all friendly and helpful,1
 giulia who checked me in very helpful as were all the other staff the room was outstanding and had lots of extra equipment like a microwave and coffee machine ,1
 staff is friendly rooms are clean and the location is perfect ,1
 we have been told lies about the free private parking facilities and most importantly didn t mention about their current refurbishment on the website to be noted that the manager and the staff were so useless i also got a penalty charge of 110 because staff gave wrong information about the parking in manor road where i have been told to park my car during my stay there overall it was the worse hostel i have attended in my entire life ,0
 well looked after,1
 the staff we met notably french speaking concierge were outstandingly friendly helpful personable efficient funny and a great credit to the hotel ,1
 they charged me 20 cash for extras and i didn t take any extras and they didn t refund it ,0
 customer service was appalling some members of staff were rude and antagonistic which seriously needs to be addressed the hotel looked dated and in need of updating definitely not a four star hotel ,0
 the staff,0
 the room had recently been refurbished and was in excellent repair we also arrived to complimentary soft drinks and a snack in the mini fridge which was lovely the value was fantastic with breakfast included ,1
 everything,1
 noise of plumbing in bedroom made sleep very difficult ,0
 excellent location lovely ambience friendly and efficient staff overall a very pleasant experience ,1
 very small room and bed for three persons ,0
 so central and good restaurants along the south bank near tube etc,1
 this is not a 4 star property they do not even have q tips when i ask for them there is no slipper or robe provided the room is small and not enough hangers just 4 the first two bottles of water are not even free and have to be paid the exterior of the building looks like a luxury boutique hotel but they do not provide some basic the lift was broken down twice within one week the staff didn t even inform us ,0
 took 2 room changes to get what we asked for air con was rubbish asked for an early book in and didn t get to our room until 4 40pm possibly the worst hilton we have ever stayed in that includes bath which was truly dreadful still trying to work out what the metropoles idea of executive room is ,0
 the area was very poor and room was also scruffy with black markings all over the walls ,0
 too expensive didn t think the customer service was very good i ordered room service twice went to order it last morning for my breakfast was 5 mins before the end of breakfast and they wouldn t deliver it i was discussed as i had paid for it not happy as we don t get a refund why have yo pay that much money for breakfast if we can t get it back if we don t have it should be able to use it another time at least also couldn t get wifi up needed it for two days i was there and didn t work ,0
 the rooms where just too crammed up a cubicle fitted with toilet shower wardrobe,0
 good size room iron provided in the room was useful hard bed suits me maybe not others good flexible workspace quick room service good breakfast for the price liked the fact it was 5 mins walk to both local tube station and the office ,1
 bed was so comfortable didn t want to get up,1
 feel bad smell of old and dirty carpet everywhere till the room,0
 we thought the hotel was lovely and the staff were helpful and friendly,1
 the friendly staff,1
 rude unprofessional staff at reception,0
 the cleaning products used were overpowering extremely strong scent and lingered throughout our entire stay even without having housekeeping come past the 1st day ,0
 the bathroom,1
 the bed was very comfy,1
 extremely small washroom room very tiny very basic room,0
 the state of the rooms is horrendous they pretend to be a 4 star hotel but it is more like a hostel you can barely get changed in the standard room as it is tiny and they charge 200 pounds for it the rooms are noisy badly equipped with old stuff lamp was held together with tape to top it off incredibly small and uncomfortable beds i am 5 11 and my feet were hanging out the pictures they use are decepting,0
 very helpful staff breakfast was very good indeed food for room service was delivered very hot and food portions were great windows had secondary glazing so the room was nice and quite even though on third floor near to main road very handy for eventim apollo ,1
 left luggage service once we checked out was useful and saved us money nespresso machine in the room was great soundproofed rooms were indeed soundproof,1
 room is not clean fan in the room is never cleaned up staff is rude and not helpful at all they need some training on their communication skills especially the two in the evening shift on may 31 when we checked in safe box cannot be opened even though i requested them doing something and they let me wait and wait and wait we checked june 3 they don t bother to fix it room is noisy outside and inside very bad simply they don t offer much service ,0
 1 when we check in the receptionist told us all rooms were occupided and we upgraded you to an apartment eventhough we booked a room the aprtement was okd fashion and not clean so we did nt accept it after all there were rooms available so it was a lie 2 the rooms are very old fashion and not clean with a ugly view 3 in the middle of nowhere ,0
 the exact location where we needed to be ,1
 the checking in process was long and tiresome we where called and then ignored for 10 15minutes the rooms were appalling very little space with old appliances littering the room 1980 s fridge was our tv stand room cleanliness was at best 3 10 for a conclusion location was great however the hotel was not especially for the price that they charge will not go to this hotel again please look somewhere else ,0
 the rooms are dated and dirty not what i expected the room service staff were rude and the food was disgusting,0
 very small and uncomfortable beds ,0
 the room wasn t clean there was no refrigerator the television was very poor and it was a basement room with no view despite having a window the wallpaper was damaged and there was a huge mould or damp stain on the ceiling ,0
 it s proximity to waterloo station transport links and to london eye and other tourist spots,1
 the room first night the room was horrible they gave us room that is not the same from the site it was downstairs there is no air conditioning no wardrobe as described on the site the room was too small and short we could not sleep because of the heat and there was only one small window which is not enough in the morning they changed the room again not from the picture i could not recommended ,0

 the staff breakfast and hotel itself,1
 the rooms was excellent value for money,1
 the location was very good the room was of a good size the bathroom was excellent the staff were helpful,1

 we are a couple with 2 kids and we rented an apartment it did not work the tv the refrigerator the toilet the windows did not close at the reception the only solution that gave us was we stay in hotel separate rooms not accepted we separated and 22h said there was responsible person who wanted that we could not go to sleep the other hand the problem is we had already paid advance they were very rude and arrogant more inform you that the apartments are away from the hotel and that there is no mention of this and that the apartments have no lift ,0

 had a very depressing dark room in the ground floor the hotel is very basic and breakfast was standard the price is too high compared to the quality ,0
 i found a cockroach at the bathroom i stays for 9 nights at the hotel and when i asked for 2 hours late check out thay refused ,0
 excellent stay best hotel to discover london and its districts excellent staff excellent location totally recommend it ,1
 we complained about the smoking of other guests despite it being a non smoking hotel the management obviously could not impose this policy as we had to suffer the smoke that came into our room through the aircon vents all throughout our stay aside from the smoke smell the toilet was on one side of our room junior suite and the sink and shower on the other side it was not a pleasant stay at this hotel definitely not worth the money we paid ,0
 if you are looking for luxury this is the hotel for you the staff were incredibly attentive the location was literally next door to the o2 arena the food was beautiful i couldn t find fault ,1
 size of the room continiuos noise for 24 hours treatment of the general manager when you complain,0
 really very good hotel and locating the bad things i had only the room size was really small ,1
 room in need of updating shower was only working on jet position of mirror for drying hair useless no facility to sit or place hair products staff at check in not friendly ,0
 the location the hotel itself and the staff great buffet breakfast in the bar area next to the reception wonderful concierge ,1
 comfy bed tasty hot chocolates,1
 unfriendly staff especially reception bad food especially room service broken phone in room alarms going off in hotel no explanations from staff breakfast felt like we were herded in like cattle left dirty milk jug on our table from previous guests power outage in room no power key slot in our room rooms not made up until late afternoon,0
 the room and the lovely staff and the free upgrade to the penthouse ,1
 too many things below standard,0
 we actually got moved very last minute but it completely worked out for the better everyone was helpful and we got a bigger room extremely happy ,1
 good breakfast,1
 we 2clup room but they give very bed room and dirty rooms,0
 very pricey for the quality of the hotel compared to others of better quality for less money it has old character but is in need of some rejuvenation stale bread at breakfast ,0
 close to paddington station hyde park is in walking area friendly staff and supportive ,1
 staff were extremely friendly and helpful room was amazing and very comfy ,1
 a quite charming boutique hotel,1
 very bad value for money expensive and micro tiny rooms very limited food choice,0
 courteous staff clean environment 24 hours services delivery absolute value for money ,1
 overpriced hotel cleanliness wasn t up to the standard and same applies to the hotel facilities the staff looked passive and not well trained to handle customers issues without a management support on the site too the breakfast was another disappointing part of the stay not only in terms of choices but also in terms of the presentation and services ,0
 old and dingy hotel security very rude expensive internet access poor service,0
 it was probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed in so small unclean and tatty,0
 from the minute we arrived the staff were so helpful polite and friendly we received an excellent service the hotel bars are relaxing with great views over the city i highly recommend this hotel ,1
 the staff were excellent the lovely room off reception location perfect price good ,1
 this is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay there is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history also the shower was incredible ,1
 toilet and sink dirty no window noisy room very small ,0
 great location very clean and neat accomodation and helpful staff twin adjoining room for kids was big ,1
 room configeration we had two young children with us,1
 nothing ,0
 location near olympia good for conferences and exhibitions attendees clean nice lounge bar rich breakfast,1
 the hotel staff were not accommodating,0
 staff were rude and unhelpful also couldn t understand simple instructions,0
 staff is very unfriendly and rude specially the asian lady on the reception rooms are so small that there were no place for keeping my shoes even what to say of bringing my luggage inside it was the worst stay of my life ever plz dnt waste your money here there are couple of other hotels in the same area stay there,0
 no view from the room at all which was very disappointing very disappointed to be honest i wanted to book something special for my wife s 40th birthday so chose this hotel based on reviews won t be doing that again and the staff service at breakfast was woeful not acceptable in any way shape or form they did not seem to care i have had better service and certainly better views i could have booked a holiday inn or premiere inn for half the price and got better service and maybe a view ,0
 location staff price,1
 complete chaos at the reception i was given an occupied room twice and got stuck in the elevator in the meantime light switches were very dirty and the room was small and noisy my colleague had the exact same experience not worth the price ,0
 we accidentally booked the wrong dates and the hotel was completely inflexible by refusing to change the dates and charged us full price such bad customer service over an honest mistake booking com were very helpful in contacting the hotel and trying to remedy the problem for us but unfortunately the hotel refused ,0
 didn t enjoy cold showers in the morning as the hot would run out before 9am the air con was set on 14 degrees cel when you complained to management regarding issues nothing was done about and you were told there was nothing wrong,0
 the location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help the breakfast had more items than i expected for example i don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea to my surprise they had both regular yogurt and greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the eiffel tower that was a totally unexpected treat although i also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small it could barely fit 1 person i don t know how the bellman got our 2 suitcases and 2 rolling carryons into it i imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor 4th ,1
 lovely spacious room which had a comfortable bed we also liked how close the hotel was to the o2 ,1
 facility of the hotel comparing the money i have paid room service was not that good fair,0
 the staff at reception were incredibly helpful the room was very comfortable with a great sized bathroom with bath tub this was the first stop in a month long trip and it was a great way to start very central location and within easy walking distance to all attractions we have already recommended the hotel to several people in the uk europe ,1
 lovely reception bar staff clean room and beautiful destination,1
 good choice of hotel good room facilities clean and spacious room ,1
 i found the attitude of the staff disgusting i have photographic evidence that pre authorization and pre payment was not required however they did a preauthorisation for the full amount which blocked money on my account and then they did it again a couple of days before the stay when i rang to query why they had done this twice whoever was answering the phone first tried to tell me they hadn t done any previous preauthorization i asked about what if i wanted to pay cash for my stay and she stated that they would then refund my card so essentially i was expected to pay for my hotel stay prior to going there in general just found the whole hotels processes shoddy and not customer friendly at all and was so put off i didn t even go and stay there and found a decent better hotel with friendly staff elsewhere ,0
 the hotel itself is extremely tired i stayed twice over a two week period for work so saw several rooms i changed because the first room was so noisy there was building work something that i hadn t been informed about in all rooms i saw 3 there was paint peeling from walls and windows old furnishing with marks it was clean but this gave the overall impression it wasn t and that you didn t really want to touch anything however the bathrooms seemed to be of much higher quality than the rooms themselves in addition although the staff were always friendly polite and eager to help sometimes service was a little slow i called to ask for the room to be cleaned which it was but they didn t remove the room service plates or restock the soft drinks in the minibar requested an iron which they said would be sent immediately but it took several hours and i d already left by then for me the gym is really important when travelling the claim was to have a state of the art gym however there was limited equipment the rower didn t work properly and one of the two running machines didn t work there were also no weights or resistance machines at all only cardio given a choice next time i wouldn t stay here again ,0
 nice big room breakfast was ok great location,1
 the location,1
 excellent location hyde park just across the road restaurants of queensway round the corner the lounges and bars are very atmospheric in a jacobean sort of way panelled and dark but very relaxing the staff are pleasant and generally helpful the price is reasonable given the location ,1
 character of hotel location,1
 the customer service was perfect every member of staff was delightful and went out of their way to help ,1
 the pure fact that your in walking distance from a lot of the beautiful sites ,1
 receptionist could see i was a regular park plaza user and gave me an upgrade very nice ,1
 although we were in a basement room it was very quiet ,1
 bar shuts early no ironing service rooms are tiny so so small we had a club room supposedly bigger you couldn t open the wardrobe and exit the room or enter the bathroom over space then bathroom my guess 1m2,0
 there is no hounisly about money and deposit,0
 the toilet bubbling up and spewing up raw sewage over the bathroom floor whilst in the shower ,0
 staff was very poor facility also,0

 gorgeous rooms amazing staff and great location,1
 the hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves i booked a double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that i was checking in late there was no room for me when i showed up at midnight there was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing they moved me down the street into a single and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room booo don t just walk run away from these crooks ,0
 having stayed at your hotel for 1 night on saturday 1st october room 632 i wanted to express my concerns i asked for these comments to be passed over during my stay but wanted to confirm in writing as the lady in reception could only say sorry having paid just under 150 for 1 night i was extremely disappointed in the quality and standard of the room provided on arrival i was required to pay 25 to cover anything used from the mini bar but then to my amazement the mini bar door would not open i was also very disappointed with the cleanliness of the bathroom especially the shower screen in the bathroom this made it extremely difficult to take a shower so had to stand in the bath as we were in a rush to get out as we had prior engagements there was no time to report this to get it sorted to reception and to be honest i didn t feel it was something i needed to do or my responsibility in such a high standard hotel which should have been at a high standard anyway on my arrival there was also a fault with the toilet on numerous occasions the cistern would not fill up so there was a constant hissing sound and unable to flush i also received a number of phone calls to the room early on sunday morning which i did not request a broken night s sleep was not what i wanted i have stayed at your hotel on a number of occasions previously but have never encountered any of the above issues i am also very disappointed as this was a surprise treat for my daughter and felt this was not good value for money as is the most i have ever paid for a double room too ,0
 bathroom and shower was dirty and damaged floors,0
 location of hotel was very good just off the main bayswater road so not too noisy but just round the corner from the underground,1
 in the presentation is written as it renovates reception but they are renovating also the restaurant breakfast can be taken in a sports bar minibar is empty windy besides windows the rooms are destroyed ,0
 i ve had a wonderful time at this hotel the room i was assigned was amazing and made me feel like home i absolutely loved it staff was helpful and happy i did not want to leave ,1
 location ,1
 very nice locale well equipped comfortable but not spacious fitness center very convenient to waterloo station which connects to central london well went for larger room which had nice sitting area and worth the extra price ,1
 this hotel is just fantastic a magnificent building spacious and luxurious rooms great park view the stuff was so helpful and polite everything we were looking for was there we would rate it as a five star hotel ,1
 the hotel is very close to 2 different metro lines and thus you can easily get anywhere in london also the hotel is very nicely maintained and the lobby with its old sofas and wooden walls is simply beautiful ,1
 location,1
 very poor management office managers and general manager don t give a dam about any requests or complain you might have they give you the impression that they don t care about your business or you coming back ,0
 very clean comfortable,1
 great room great bathroom fantastic breakfast staff friendly attentive but also totally professional especially happy to discover my window could open did someone read my previous review ,1
 over priced old furniture small rooms this should be a 3 star hotel,0
 a super location just few minutes from the london eye houses of parliament and restaurants along the south bank the reception staff were very helpful and friendly we also enjoyed a very nice meal in the hotels italian restaurant excellent service from our waiter this was a visit for friends jointly celebrating 50th birthdays the birthday balloons and wine were a very thoughtful touch we had a great weekend and will definitely visit again ,1

 the staff were not friendly at all no smile and not even a nod for greeting the people ,0
 great location very good staff full sky sports package ,1
 stunning hotel beautiful bedrooms with lovely personal touches for example a small atomiser left on bed to aid sleeping ,1
 the staff were rude incompetent and did not listen to us they charged extra even though a refund was given they made no effort to apologise for their mistake the hotel also takes quite a long time to respond to queries completely unprofessional given that the location is in the heart of the financial district with a lot of business customers ,0
 payment taken before i arrived my booked room had been taken the room they offered in exchange was dirty the room they finally found for me was in the basement with no windows hot tiny 2m x 3m including the ensuite claustrophobic and barely had room to open the door the essential air con was noisy i woke with a headache the double bed was short enough that i had to sleep diagonally the ensuite was so small that it was hard to bathe and dry without banging elbows and knees 0 6m 1 5m for miniscule loo miniscule sink and miniscule shower ,0
 nice hotel large and clean room no noise,1
 the hotel was beautiful and in a great location the room was first class ,1
 room wasn t what we expected on arrival we was told to pay 244 up front which we wasn t told you had to put 50 deposit incase of using the room service facilities which we didn t besides that im still waiting for my refund five days later for facilities we didn t intend to use ,0
 unique decor great breakfast room easy to get to ,1
 very poor hotel cramped room unable to see through window as the bed was in the way dated furniture and dirty marks on the walls very disappointed as it was a treat for my husband s birthday not worth the money been in better hotels for cheaper ,0
 there were no vending machines the rooms are dirty as hell bathroom was nasty with nasty looking markings on the toilet the room was often cold the receptionists were not bothered by any requests to have the room cleaned my stay was less than favorable i will not be returning to this property my earnings are worth some type of politeness and respect i will be filing a formal complaint ,0
 the location is very good only 5min stroll to paddington tube the staff were very friendly helpful the room was spotlessly clean very warm with beautiful furnishings the wine fruit was a lovely touch ,1
 rooms are ridiculously small breakfast quality is awful ,0
 location staff breakfast clean room,1
 good location friendly staff nice breakfast,1

 light didnt work wifi didnt work couldnt print boarding pass,0
 horrible rooms old the room finished before u enter it ,0
 excellent location close to more than metro station nice staff lovely decorations at the reception ,1
 convenience and size of rooms,1
 allocated a room on the basement floor next to the kitchen not only did the room smell and very filthy hairs in the shower sticky carpets and dust the walls were not sound proof hence it felt as thou you were staying in the kitchen itself ,0
 ac wasn t working in my room when the repair man came to fix it he couldn t and then told me that it s winter and people don t need the ac room was uncomfortably hot check out was a nightmare my cab driver was waiting to take me to the airport twice reception told me i had money to be owed however this was untrue after they checked their records i had the same problem at check in bell boy took over 20 min to bring my bags down from my room wouldn t reccomend this hotel ,0
 the staff were and are extremely racist and very rude,0
 the night club noise which kept us awake until 2am when we had planned a relaxing stay even worse when we complained and were told we would be upgraded to a suite if we stayed again the manager then refused to honour this needless to say we won t be staying again also the spa was really dirty sauna was dropping to bits we had planned to use this hotel for our wedding a few years ago and are so thankful we went to the renaissance chancery instead,0
 everything could have been better management just watched the chaos unfold the waitress had a tantrum in front of the customer the other waiter didn t understand a word,0
 staff and amenities no room service no vending machines no access to food all night,0
 room was comfortable but very small more intimate than private but clean and tidy shower difficult to use and poor screen means it leaks on the bathroom floor compact sink but all in all everything you need and hotel affords a great location ,1
 very good bed ,1
 rooms poor not heated dirty linen and poor managerial service,0
 great location large rooms with real windows that open rare in london ,1
 rooms are definitely not like on the pictures its dirty and it smells pretty bad in there the reception is partly nice but not able to actually fulfill your needs rooms are super small,0
 the whole place including staff were so extremely lovely and helpful and just generally amazing there isn t one thing i can say against the place brilliant ,1
 easy walk from euston buses and tube all nearby calm quiet interior ,1
 the rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere due to building work in progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture ,1
 when we arrived we where met by a very nice gentleman whom checked us in and told us where our room was and that it was all ready for us to go up early check in our room was right beside a building site when we looked out the window we where staring right into the workmen faces they even gave us a smile and a wave they where that close not appropriate for a mother with a teenage daughter to be facing onto i asked to be moved and they moved us one floor up to the same horrid dirty brown room no bedside lamps dirty carpets old bathroom one word shabby i then complained to booking com and was told to let the hotel manager sort something out the only thing i wanted them to do was move us to another hotel so i gave them a chance and we got a nicer room on the 8 floor and yes guess what another building site only this time a generator when all night i tried calling booking com back and waited nearly an hour for them to answer but we had a reservation to go to so i had to leave it at that on the monday we were woken to the sound of the fire alarm at 7 05am then again at 8am to be told it was the toaster in the restaurant causing the problem this happened several times and no staff let us know what was going on i had to phone down and ask the reception myself having to cue up for breakfast every morning was ridiculous too surely they must know how many guest they have staying in the hotel the whole experience was horrific it was my 1st time taking my daughter away since her dad died and i certainly didn t expect unfriendly unmannerly staff and a very poor standard and quality of hotel i stay in london regularly and have stayed in some beautiful hotels no way is this hotel worth the price try somewhere else trust me ,0
 the staff are soo nice specially a romainan guy in the reception,1
 the wi fi was rubbish check in was a hassle ,0
 no direct stairs access to higher than first floor poor hotel knowledge of desk staff ,0
 room was 190 our room was like a box definitely not value for money when we booked on booking com said breakfast included when we got to desk were told it wasn t wouldn t recommend this hotel,0
 super location on division underground line direct to heathrow and central london older facility but very accommodating staff good breakfast many restaurant stores 1 2 block away bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish quite comfy but small rooms beautiful garden in back overall a great value for london would stay here again ,1
 their policy which allow children under 12 years old free of charge if stay in exiting bed but when i checked in they told me that the room that i booked can only stay 2 persons due to security reason they charged me more for eur60 per night which i think it does not fair to me because i already followed the policy and did confirm it again through email but they still want to charge me by the stupid reason about security policy ,0
 staff attention general installations,0
 you will see the smallest room in ur life with them comparing with what you paid really so bad rooms and old,0
 the room and bed were comfortable and the bathroom clean and well appointed i arrived went to bed and left early the next morning i had no breakfast so cannot comment on the food 10 minutes walk from king s cross ,1
 comfort view facilities ,1
 the tv was not working it was turning on and shutting down randomly making a lot of noise the room was tiny and the bed not comfortable at all the hotel was clearly not a 4 stars but more a 2 stars the location was not bad it s really not worth its price,0
 everything was nice but there was no welcoming toy for the kids,1
 room far too small no iron bathroom tiny no bar staff rude staff not helpful breakfast bread stale and gone off milk cold boiled eggs left sitting kitchen visible from dining room not nice rooms stuffy air con not working properly afraid to complain as staff so rude,0
 staff very polite and helpful stylish decor very clean quiet despite busy roads not too big restaurant served lovely food for dinner and breakfast ,1
 breakfast was good and staff very friendly i really loved that each room has a smartphone with unlimited calls and internet in london for your personal use if you feel like taking it out room was very clean and bedding seemed new or in very good condition ,1
 liked everything about this hotel,1
 got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town ,1
 service completely incompetent unhelpful only room service staff knew what to do the rooms were dirty the amount of dust in the wardrobe was shocking i have never seen something like that in ta room which costs 250 a night in central london ,0
 we didn t have space for breakfast,0
 dimly lit corridors with inadequate safety signage on steps caused me to have an accident during my stay staff were ill equipped to deal with this and did not speak very good english ,0
 old hotel with ancient furniture and dirty carpets,0
 the room was clean and comfortable with a view over a quiet street lined with trees although space was somewhat limited as other reviewers have mentioned this didn t affect the quality of our stay and we would come back again we had an excellent breakfast freshly squeezed orange juice and real coffee with strength and flavour a good range of food options and friendly service the staff were all polite and helpful and we were very happy with our stay at the hotel ,1
 grand location very helpful staff beautiful interior ,1

 beautiful room with luxurious beds hotel is gorgeous with a great view over the thames staff very friendly and helpful breakfast was wonderful great location for the o2 arena fantastic manager,1
 booked a family room no a c heating working 2 small children moved room supposedly an upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass spent the night in a cold bedroom not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs a very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office i still had to pay ,0
 room was not cleaned curtains were broken bathroom door was broken ,0
 spacious room very comfortable bed and pillows were just right made for welcome sleep well stocked bathroom toiletries very strong wifi signal whole time i was there self service english breakfast which you just helped yourself welcome benefit to go back for more i got to breakfast late and staff were starting to clear away but i did get my meal and staff encouraged me to help myself to more food there is a small car park at front entrance about a dozen or so cars so if anyone needs to park a car i suppose you need to contact reception to reserve a space although i didn t need it just thought i d mention it for others ,1
 it was amazing staff so friendly ,1
 very bad beds small rooms poor wifi not 4 star try to over charge ,0
 the look of the hotel in general is poor stained carpet in room and halls dark earthenware and seemed to be dirty standard room size extremely small and uncomfortable no drawers for storing clothes only a small closet the cleaning of our room was insufficient and always forget details in the bathroom towels amenities undoubtedly the worst radisson blu that i have experienced in europe previously i was in gdansk polland and praha czech republic ,0

 staff bed architecture ,1

 everything tiered rooms rude staff,0
 manager lacks business acumen i checked out early due to an emergency and they refused to credit me for the extra day hilton just lost future nights from a business traveller becauae one greedy manager could not see the forest from the trees great hire for local franchisee colossal failure for the franchise ,0

 very small room paid extra for a larger room but was very disappointed stuck in a room at the back of the hotel could only just get round bottom of bed between desk and bed advertised as having mini bar no mini bar bit of a dated feel to bathroom spoke to staff to see if bigger room available was told no very intimidated to have 4 staff members behind the counter was offered a possible room move after we got back from the theatre after i almost started crying not practical as we got back late and didn t want the fuss not the romantic time i had hoped for from this hotel ,0

 very good hotel we went to see a concert at the o2 arena it made it hassle free in fact you walk out of the o2 arena via a different route and do not have to queue too much to get out room and service was fantastic the breakfast offered very good choice ,1
 the staff didn t speak very good english or understand me we were greeted by a man fixing the air conditioning when we very first opened the door into our room we were told by the man fixing the unit that it was unsafe to stay in the rooms would not stay here again very disappointed as the hotel has a lot of potential of being a whole lot better ,0

 staff were helpful and friendly the location was excellent for getting around paris on foot or by taxi ,1
 this hotel is really tired and in need of refurbishment everywhere you look there are marks on the walls tired carpets and damaged wood work in my single room the heating did not work a small plug in rad was put in to compensate but this was not man enough for a winters night and i had to get extra bedding my room had the following faults curtains hanging off the track did not close window screwed shut and no way to get any fresh air bathroom had stray hairs behind the door and on the bath the underside of the taps has brown scale build up the soap tray was corroded the spy hole in the door was blocked up with loo roll the bath panel was bubbled from water damage the walls had marks and there was no bbc channels only news 24 ,0
 beds are horribly hard for a five star hotel staff is often untrained and does not speak any english problem solving is very very slow ,0
 location was great for tube and walking into the heart of action,1
 classy tasteful d cor great location courteous staff and some nice little touches in the rooms that made it feel special nice place for a romantic getaway ,1
 my room didn t have a window when i asked for one i was asked to pay more money they did not provide me with parking unless i payed 80 pounds more then my room price one of the worst places i ve every stayed in the double bed was 2 single hard beds put together an it was 50s old mattress ido not advise anybody to stay here the worst customer service as well,0
 very helpful staff and plenty of them,1
 the beautiful d cor and edwardian atmosphere ,1
 the hotel has very poor security because there is no cctv camera at the corridors our carry on luggages zips are broken and the hotel couldn t provide neither satisfiable nor reasonable investigation for us ,0
 small room and noisy surrounding with road work no air condition ,0
 as a long term or regular guest i expect the hotel to keep your baggage for free even if it is more than 24 hours ,0

 the staff were attentive and thoughtful they were happy to answer questions and print off our theatre tickets etc a very pleasant stay with the thoughtful little touches you d expect turning down the sheets in the evening giving a fragrance to the room my wife loved very good ,1
 it is simply the worst hotel ever had to check out after a few hours on top of that was charged at the hotel as well as via booking com i want a refund the manager gave me a mouth full and told i was an idiot etc etc no one should say anything wrong about his hotel he said i was lost for words checked in a four seasons afterwards only reason for booking the hotel was that it was close to the expo i was attending what a cardinal mistake ,0
 i stayed here to get a good nights sleep before my marathon in the area and did not get a wink of sleep rooms were stinking hot even with windows open in april air con didn t work with windows open kept awake by planes landing other people arriving home at different times in the night kept us awake you can hear every step every cough every word of people staying above or next to you had to change rooms at 1am to smaller took which smelt of damp in the basement which still was noisy and claustrophobic ,0
 w3 is by no means a good location but ok we were a family of six and upon arrival were put into 2 far away rooms on the 6th floor where upon our entry the temperature was above 28 c the a c was faulty in both rooms outside it was noisy so opening the window only brought it down a little whilst the room has gotten too noisy in the other room to which we were relocated the shower mixer only had either a hot or a very hot water the receptionist shakiri i think was her name was massively unhappy that i bothered her with a request to update the keys as they were not working she had not been taking care of her nail polish and looked very very poor and unpleasant ,0
 no fresh air or open windows and no fridge in the room room space very narrow never again,0
 the hotel grabs your attention from the outset with its modern classy look staff were helpful and the direct tunnel to the o2 arena is fantastic would definitely recommend and would stay here again ,1
 very miserable and unhappy staff wifi impossible to use so weak hotel staff empty bins etc at early hours outside room sitting in lounge at 6 30am cleaners started cleaning floor around my feet plaster peeling off wall in room 240v electric iron cable worn through to wires in two sections of the cable highly dangerous ,0
 i changed rooms paying a 35 pound supplement to have an outward facing room this room may have had the best view in london it was perfect so for an extra cost it made our trip to london sooooo much better the restaurant was also good value for dinner ,1

 very dated poor quality room,0
 excellent location,1
 the room was tiny for the money paid i have stayed at hotels with bigger rooms for less and in better areas i was quite annoyed because i booked the early deal pay now for two nights instead of one i realised immediately and emailed for help i was more than happy to pay up front as i wanted this but i had made a mistake with days i was told i couldn t change it and get a refund for one night i find this unhelpful and irritating as i didn t change my mind nor was i being a nuisance i realised witching 30 seconds and spoke to someone money making is clearly important to the hotel i can see why as having been there i would not go back ,0
 i lost 300 cash in this hotel i don t know who take this is my first time lost money in the hotel just a small advise when you check in just put cash and valuable things in the safety box if you don t the staff in the hotel will told you is your responsibility to put money in the safety box and they can do nothing if your cash or valuable things disappear ,0
 newly renovated,1

 location was excellent as it was very close to earls court station and to the main high street staff were friendly and breakfast was really good we were given the executive room which has direct access to the beautiful garden my whole family loved this hotel and for sure will book it again when i travel to london ,1
 booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t the tv didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and i should just make do very sub standard,0
 everything,0
 this hotel is completely misrepresented this hotel would be lucky to rate 2 star the room had no fridge no safe but for 5 ponds you rent a safe deposit box in the lobby which if you want to access you wait in the general queue the restaurant was closed for dinner on 3 out of 6 nights and they charge 5 pounds to deliver room service the main bar only opened at sporadic times they offered a smoking room which was not available when question about the standard of the hotel the staff responded with a take it or leave it attitude the hotel charges 85 pounds for a taxi to heathrow while a local car company charges 45 pounds i will never book a britannia hotel anywhere ever again the owner must rate his own hotels because there is no way in the wide world this is a 4 star establishment ,0
 compact but everything you would need comfy and clean slept very well lovely fluffy towels complimentary water and fruit on arrival ,1
 reception staff very welcoming rooms are very clean and the beds are very comfortable short walk to the o2 for a show we will definitely return if going to the o2 again great selection at breakfast ,1

 excellent location you have the access to earl s court underground within 3 minutes walk district and piccadilly lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially heathrow without any transfer many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter ,1
 all staff members are extremely friendly and supportive ,1
 the room was the smallest room i have every stayed in the room was not clean the towels were not clean as i cut myself and the towel had blood on it and was just folded up and put back on the shelf for the next day the bath was never cleaned as it always had hair in it the lifts are the worst it took me 25 min one night to get a lift to my room the hotel had a convention on at the time so was extremely over crowded couldn t use the bar couldn t use the cafe couldn t find any place to sit at all as the whole ground floor was taken over by the people from the convention this hotel is very expensive and way over priced for the service and facilities provided i stayed with my family for 12 days and half of us were in one side of the hotel and the others were in the other side of the hotel the hotel was unable to find 2 rooms together would never stay at this hotel again ,0

 huge ripoff buyer beware room was nothing like photos photos showed two large windows open room floor plan purchased upgraded room to exec suite yet actual size was small and all the space was in a lone unusable hallway actual room was small maybe 150 sq ft it was cramped low headroom ducking to get through doorways the view was only visible if you climbed out of the single tiny window onto a 3 ft wide narrow ledge staff sold museum 2 day ticket without warning even though they knew the pompidou was closed on strike hotel desk told us by phone that they could get us tickets to a classical concert we wanted to attend we rushed back to only be told it was sold out staff did not want anyone in the lobby seating if you were not buying drinks i stay in europe frequently on business and no one could ever consider this a 4 star hotel i have stayed at much nicer three star hotels ,0
 excellent staff who are wonderful with children light spacious rooms with good facilities excellent central location easy walking distance of many sights two tube stations river boats and tourist buses multiple eating options westminster southbank and london eye all nearby from reservations and reception to housekeeping and room service the staff couldn t have been more helpful or accommodating this is a really good hotel and great for family visits ours was a special family visit with grandparents parents and four grandchildren two children visiting for the first time and as a birthday treat the reservation and reception teams thanks to courtney michaela and i think sara apologies for any incorrect spelling helped organise rooms with a wonderful view and facilities which made the visit very special for the grandchildren and grown ups the children also enjoyed the glass lift reception staff were absolutely wonderful alba was so welcoming and made an instant friend when she gave our grandson a lollipop on arrival and arranged birthday balloons and chocolate cake in the room being able to arrange breakfast in the room made for a more relaxed start to the day and room service and housekeeping were so efficient and responsive managing to get our breakfast to us when we wanted it even when we forgot to put down the time for one of the rooms making the quietest meal delivery for the babysitters when the children were asleep and restoring order to our chaotic rooms while we were out this is the second time we have stayed at park plaza county hall and given the high quality of the rooms and the excellent customer service we intend to return ,1
 rooms really small phone did not work electrical outlets in wrong area and not enough mirrors lighting housekeeping did not clean room appropriately or change drinking glasses ,0
 the staff was welcoming and extremely helpful the hotel room was modern yet had historical touches that we loved the location was within walking distance of the louvre and many shops along saint germain des pres wonderful choice for us ,1

 the receptionist was very rude she seems to enjoy making things difficult for customers we stayed one adult and one child and they charged tax for 2 adults even though they can see its one adult it s not the money as much as how rude she was and unfriendly ,0
 the staff were very pleasant ,1
 the bed was very comfortable and the linens crispy clean we paid 15pounds for the breakfast buffet which was good with fresh fruit eggs were delicious the price for breakfast is a little high i liked the free coffee in the lobby and the free apples service for breakfast excellent with lots of refills and frquent refills on the hot items which were also really hot ,1
 staffs attitude towards complaints dated rooms unclean rooms,0
 good location close to best shops and within walking distance of most key sites staff service very good room spacious by central paris standard and well equipped king size bed very convenient for roissybus service to from cdg ,1
 asked for early check in and a quite room as my wife needs rests during the day arrived and was told no rooms available before 2pm then given one at the back of the hotel right next to a very busy main rail route with constant train noise and room was very hot so had to keep the window open as air conditioner was very noisy so had nearly no sleep mentioned this when checking out and got no apology or recognition that there was something wrong breakfast was over priced for what was on offer won t be staying there again we felt we were brushed off by the staff when checking in and when discussing the room at check out ,0
 no response from the staff very small room clean is very poor,0

 lovely quiet area easy walk from station and very nice room i stayed at the sister hotel paddington court ,1
 there was no hot water most of the room are in the basement the bed was too small and to top it all the ac was too noisy and woke me up at 6 is this really a best western and was this a joke too ,0
 noise throughout the night lots of unruly children in reception and restaurant rude restaurant front of house and waited over 45 minutes to sit for a pre booked afternoon tea even though we arrived 15 minutes early over an hour late to check in had to wait until after 4pm considering the cost of a suite this was terrible offered a complimentary cocktail as the only compensation after we d purchased 3 rounds during our long wait supposedly booked a loft suite but it was only on the first floor overlooking the road and traffic wouldn t recommend ,0
 excellent location for the o2 staff were very friendly and couldn t do enough for you darragh on check in was particularly helpful would highly recommended this hotel if you are taking in a show or event in the o2 ,1
 the room was lovely staff were brilliant too very helpful offering maps and recommendations ,1
 the comfort of the room was lovely and the decor was beautiful even though the noise from the roads outside could be heard it wasn t loud at all and we slept soundly the hotel looks and feels like it should be a lot more expensive for what it is and that s a testiment to the hotel a fantastic stay ,1
 the first room we were put in was on the first floor on the street side i didn t get a wink of sleep because it was so noisy outside also the air conditioning wasn t working in this room so it was very uncomfortable we asked for a double room but got two single beds i asked for this to be dressed as a double bed for my wife and i and was assured by reception that room service would do so the following day when we returned to the room after a day at a business outing like a zombie from lack of sleep we found the bed was still dressed as two single beds when i called down to mention these issues we were moved to the 6th floor not on street side so hopefully a better sleep no such luck the air conditioning was still not working in this room and it was smaller than the first room at least we had a double bed the walls were paper thin so we heard the people in the room next door when they stumbled in at 3am the morning we were due to check out there was no hot water in the bathroom when we rang reception to mention the issue and that we had to shower before leaving the staff member seemed to laugh about it and say we can bring our stuff down to the first floor and shower there just not a great experience overall and not even worth half the money that i paid for this one of the worst hotel experiences that we have had ,0
 the room was small and poor quality,0
 very small room an old fashioned small double bed pushed up against the window en suite not big enough to swing a mouse no breakfast ,0
 room was as tiny as a matchbox ,0

 the hotel was excellent,1
 tap dripped in the bath not fixed during our stay light switch for the bathroom in strange place,0

 the staffs were really nice and the bed very confortable,1
 consistently good standards always reassured that the standard is always excellent every time we stay ,1
 2 min walk to london eye westminster south bank waterloo station had a lovely room which accommodated us as a family of 3 perfectly breakfast was great too ,1
 the housekeeping staff the one we came across at least was rather rude we needed a baby cot and there was one in the room when we arrived but it was broken then we called the housekeeping and the one of the house keeping staff female who came to replace it she tried to convince us that it was not broken then when the room attendant decided to replace it she brought as girl s cot and in a way although we mentioned that our baby was a boy we had to put the baby for the duration of the stay in a girls cot apart from the housekeeping room attendants the other staff at the reception were really polite and nice concerning the size of rooms and hotel facilities these were really small lift very very small can only fit three people or one person with a baby pram reception area extremely small and when people have luggage a the the space become even more squashy standard room really really small fitness facilities such as a pool steam bath etc which are mentioned in the website we were informed by the reception staff that hotel customers can use the fitness facilities of other partner hotels in the area this means that information on the hotel website are misleading potential customers overall we feel that this hotel is the worst by far option of a hotel for booking your holidays ,0
 excellent service small but very comfortable room ,1
 perfect for any o2 event new and well run you need look no further for the right place to camp before and after a performance ,1

 1 i booked a deluxe room a couple with 6 months infant and noted my late check in by calling the hotel upon arrival no one helped us with the babystroller and our 3 bags receptionist was looking and waiting 2 we have been given a room that is just a door and you directly must hop on the bed i doubt if it is suitable for human being though we have an infant and i ve been told ooh ok that was our last room sleep and squeeze your baby and tomorrow we give you another one 3 in that room no refrigerator to keep my baby s milk and food i guess that is illegal and no one cares 4 there is no shampoos no soap nothing at all a blocked sink 5 next day another room and offered me a breakfast to please us after i spent the night sleeping under the bed to give a space to my child 6 i just had a look at the breakfast sorry this is not something to offer i moved away immediatly 7 the hotel is outdated and rubbish 8 they took extra booking price compred to the one i see on booking with a difference of 100 usd,0
 the location and the upgrade,1

 we were upgraded for free for a fabulous suite is was a great stay ,1
 good ambience ,1
 location is awesome more restaurants nearby incldg indian and chinese very closeby to bayswater and queensway station a beautiful catholic church nearby nice ambience would love to be there again,1
 closeness to the o2,1
 very bad experience ,0
 there are a lot of miscommunication the room was too small and i don t feel like staying at 5 star hotel i booked for 2 people but found only one dressing gown we asked the staff to come and pick up the plate after we ate the food in the morning and had to explain why well the room was too small and we don t have enough space to walk i came back home and my passport disappeared so i tried to call the hotel many times at 9 30 am and no one pick up the phone ,0
 management accommodated for burst pipes by providing a free upgrade and taxi to our evening destination good location and building,1
 didn t like the position because of the close proximity to the railway station and it brought about many people who were just hanging about drunk not a good area ,0
 look of the place good level of service without being too formal ,1
 bed uncomfortable springs first room we were given had a sewage smell and we asked to be moved which they did with no problem ,0
 the professionalism of the staff attentative but not too overbearing ,1
 location is super convenient friendly and helpful staff ,1
 in my first room the air conditioning didn t work only the fan was working so i asked the reception for someone to come and see it and possibly fix it i called three times within an hour or two but no one turned up after a long wait i went to the reception and asked whether anyone was coming i was told someone would come later when i m away but when i arrived late in the evening it turned out that no one had visited my room to see what s wrong with the ac so i went to the reception again and i was given another room with apologies and that was ok no complaints here but in the new room the ac wasn t working at all the switch did not even turn on when i went to the reception again it was so overwhelmed with people checking in that there was no chance to get to speak to anyone so i gave up on further fight and since the weather was getting a bit cooler i decided to live without the ac however that s not the end of it in the new room there was also a bathroom vent extremely noisy and impossible to switch off too loud to sleep at night and finally on the next night we found a half dead cockroach lying in the bathtub photo enclosed all in all a disgrace ,0
 they didnt clean our room for 3 days we had to ask at the reception for clean towels and sheets they didnt even throw away our garbage there were two ladies at the reception who werent very nice the internet wasnt working constantly the isolation of the balcony was not good at all u can hear the noises from the street 24 7 and on the top the room was a bit cold ,0
 the hotel was in a bad condition not really clean and everything was worn out breakfast was barely ok and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when i got it hotel arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise ,0

 great location for o2 staff very helpful great pool,1
 location of hotel was perfect the staff where very helfull and tended to our ever need ,1

 room very small view on the back even for a mid price room ,0

 they sent us to a room in the basement with only a very small window that we couldn t open our phone had no signal in the room cleaning was poor,0
 the beds were terrible the bathroom was dated the noise from the generators was very high,0
 we loved the location and the breakfast ,1
 the breakfast was so enjoyable all the usual expectations but extra touches such as individual smoothies home made yoghurt pots plus a lovely setting with views over the thames ,1
 overall a brilliant but short stay with a lovely young irish at reception just wanted to compliment one young lady in particular whose name is pheobe she was very courteous pleasant and took time to make sure all our needs were met thank you,1
 i booked a plan that included breakfast when arrived the lady who checked me and my mother in insisted under the supervision and instructions of another member of staff that we booked a plan without meals included even after showing the email from booking com stating that breakfast was included to avoid any hassles i decided to pay for the additional breakfast cost at that point with the original price i expected to pay when i made the booking in the currency of my credit card not in gbp when i checked out the lady who supervised the junior staff when i checked in told me that they made the mistake of charging me extra for the breakfast and would refund the extra cost she processed the refund in gbp without asking which currency i would like to receive a refund because of their mistake the worst thing was that the supervisor that made the mistake when i checked in and the same person who was responsible for checking me out did not explain the situation nor offered any apologies i was only given an explanation after i sternly asked for one when she asked for my credit card to process the refund i could accept the almost misleadingly spacious image of the room when i made the booking considering the part of country i was visiting i could not accept the irresponsible and unprofessional handling of their mistakes i might not have shown my disagreement at the spot because i had my mother to take care of i would definitely advise against any one staying at such an establishment i would rather book a much cheaper accommodation and willingly accept such unprofessional service ,0
 air conditioner breakfast,0
 the twin room and bathroom,0
 location was perfect room got upgraded thanks to the lovely staff ,1
 staff were very friendly and helpful our room was very comfortable the decor throughout was pleasant both breakfast and dinner were very good apart from the scrambled egg ,1

 room was spacious and clean hotel was ideally located and food was great,1
 there was blood on my pillow upon arrival fridge and phone was broken and i had to ring down three times overall for them to send someone up we were left with no towels after they cleaned the room the tv had a universal remote and subtitles were stuck on the screen as we were unable to turn them off the staff were unprofessional and lacked basic customer service skills no room around the bed so we had to get changed in front of the door,0
 no vip reception in the rooms extras ,0
 very good value for the money we paid and this in central london clean comfortable and with amenities like a pool we didn t have the time to use it unfortunately will definitely come back and spend more time here ,1
 check in dismissive rude air conditioning in room broken bed sags to floor at the foot shower no control of scalding cold water shower floods bathroom toilet black filthy below water level toilet paper not replaced by room staff power usb sockets broken un useable television screen and sound faulty gym un useable check out credit card system broken check out unable to provide receipt refund of initial deposit,0

 great location on fleet st,1
 the view was very good big ben chard houses of parliment complimentary 1hr late checkout ,1
 room is too small,0
 the heating wasn t controllable for our room the staff had putting the fans on override so that it always blew out hot air even when choosing cool we had to go to reception on more than one occasion to complain at 11 45 pm we still couldn t sleep and was very uncomfortable so i made my way back down to reception where i had to wait in a long line of people checking in i was very tired they said they would send someone up to open out window which had been screwed shut 12 15 am we finally had a nock on the door where a member of reception came in with a spanner and a tool to open the window this meant i had to sit awake to let them in it took a good half hour for the room to cool so finally got to sleep gone 1 00 am we were told that the windows were screwed shut because of the outside noise i m sure customers should be allowed to choose whether or not they can handle the noise with the window open on top of this the member of staff didn t leave us with any tools to close the window this meant we had to sleep and all night and morning with the window wide open as there was no way of shutting it with out this caused the rain to come in the window too came away from the trip with two poor nights sleep and not feeling refreshed at all ,0
 location decor in main areas ,1
 very comfortable hotel great location staff very friendly and helpful room size is very good ,1
 the bathroom was amazing ,1
 excellent situation in paris bed very confortable ,1
 the property was below what the website has shown it was very poor facilities poor room equipment and certainly not 4 stars the bed moved a lot and made a lot of noise the heater was working and would t get switched off the bathroom sometimes had no warm water only very hot burning water i was shocked to know upon arrival that there was no room service and no mini bar the door was normally locked and i couldn t open it with the room card i had to call someone from the reception each time to open the door themselves ,0
 it was very close to the umderground so the location was great ,1
 poor hotel structure very noisy dirty rooms poor breakfast ,0
 the receptionist didn t know what floor my room was on when i found my room in the basement someone else was in my room they had gotten their room number wrong and their key had opened my door they said they had also gotten into another room accidentally on the 3rd floor when they also were sent to the wrong room clearly there is a lack of security in this establishment and poor staff the room itself was cold and small ,0
 comfortable room coffee tea wonderful shower many choices in breakfast bar,1
 bed and room lovely ,1
 staff,0
 the location was great just across from wonderful hyde park the kensington palace and more we are pretty fast walkers so for us this was an ideal location we accessed so many places from this easy navigable location it is a short distance from the tube subway the hop on hop off buses restaurants pharmacy health food stores coffee shops grocers and more the hospitality was incredible robert greeted us and offered help with our luggage as soon as we entered the historical lobby which was quaint with rich woods and great architectural detail lauren roberta and others who worked the front desk were there to ensure a great stay for us they were always ready to assist with directions and suggestions regarding what to see and do in london the beautiful and classy and clean dining rooms offered breakfast which was plentiful and varied with hot and cold options that would satisfy most any traveler the servers were very attentive to the diners needs the stairway adjacent to the lobby is full of architectural charm including alfresco paintings on the ceiling beautiful wood is used throughout the stairwell there s a library or huge drawing room adjacent to the lobby i imagine a great deal of friends have gathered there over the years the bed was very comfortable ,1
 we agreed on price 150euro but they requested additional 190 euro for our kid who is ten years old we payed 340 plus city tax very terrible approach to the customers never been again,0
 very trendy very clean and very friendly,1
 small dirty room rip off price ,0
 my room was a good size for paris the decor was lovely and very french which was nice,1
 staff are very nice and helpful simply they care very convenient location close to main london attractions our stay was pleasant and if we visited london again for sure we will check in at this hotel ,1
 tv never worked properly bathroom was dirty kept awake all night by noisy people on same floor staff did not seem bothered when i reported this overall a horrible stay ,0
 not a family hotel hotel is too big for them to manage things like room service information etc will be delayed and not suitable for people to travel with babies toddlers,0
 staff helpful good breakfast proximity is excellent,1
 everything was great on my recent stay in that hotel and all was up to perfect in terms of the staff and the exotic services and facility provided by the hotel also location is fabulous one thing i would like to mention about my experience with that hotel i made my booking through hotel booking web site and it was non refundable one month and a half before my arrival so when i have checked the price of the room i have booked later in the site i found cheaper than the price i booked my room for so i made i contact the hotel booking customer service and explain the matter and they have respond immediately to my request and sent a notification to the reservation department in intercontinental park lane hotel and thay agreed right away to modify it and they sent me a new booking confirmation with the new price offered in the website i appreciate that so much and proof to me that is hotel booking is the best choise to book my hotel in my future trip ,1
 the staff are warm and willing to solve problems ,1
 the fact i had requested a late check out but was disturbed twice by housekeeping the fact that i had to push for an extended check out beyond my late check out and was still charged i won t be visiting again ,0
 very clean large rooms with high value toiletries extremely comfortable bed and pillows friendly staff ,1
 all are very bad foods are not fresh reception guys are really stupid my room was dirty smells like a toilet beds were dirty too i asked for a flipper they said they don t have wifi is not working even mobile phone connection is weak can t make any phone call ,0
 third visit ti this hotel and the last air conditioning in any room never works far too hot cant open a window rooms need refurbishing very much a two star hotel ,0
 the rude front of house staff who could only retell policies and not do anything to find a solution ,0
 very good location comfort bed nice and kind staff quiet and well designed just a few walk to kensington gardens and kensington palace ,1
 quiet location away from hustle and bustle of the tourist sights yet near enough to walk to a tube station or parks ,1
 the bed was comfortable and the location was great ,1
 mojitos in the theatre bar close to transport,1
 old world charm of the decor how near the tube was walking in hyde park ,1
 we stayed in a non smoking room and the room smelt of cigarettes someone was going to come up and freshen up the room no one came to do this and we was not offered another room the state of the room needs updating as there is allot of rust in the bath rooms this is not worth 115 per night the executive suit is just two double beds pushed together ,0
 everything ,0
 great location for pantheon and shopping ,1
 following an initial problem with the room the staff couldn t have done enough to help us i would recommend this hotel to anyone,1
 staff was very nice and helpful single rooms are small and seem to need some refurbishment the location was the main reason of my booking breakfast is good with good selection ,1
 the hotel is really nice and the location is perfect the staff was not as good and quick that i would have desired,1
 please renovate the rooms there is urgent need for that without rooms renovation it is hardly 3 star hotel,0
 very clean and local to attractions,1
 bed was really comfy like the double type shower feature and the sit down shower was a real bonus after a long day walking around london ,1
 great location staff could not do enough for us i would most definitely stay there again thank you to all at the apex ,1
 the hotel was excellent in every way and the service was second to none we particularly enjoyed the breakfast and the pool the location of the hotel could not be better ,1
 the staff is terrible unwelcoming and rude never to stay here again,0
 the receptionist is not really friendly to me every day i saw guests argue with the receptionist over things they just don t seem to be helpful at all the lift was broken the entire time i was there so have to climb floors everyday the room is spacious but not very clean the floor is so thin that you can basically hear everything your neighbors do especially at night the mattress is the worst and you can actually feel the springs inside in won t recommend for a long stay ,0
 room was adequate breakfast was lovely lots of choice staff were friendly and chatty ,1
 staff s kindness and efficiency the cake for my girlfriend s birthday really nice attention cleanliness location,1
 perfect location between the metro stations grands boulevards and cadet my favourite area of paris with lots of caf s bakeries and food shops cleanness and stylish design of the room very comfortable double bed spacious bathroom with a window nice little balcony room 603 a kettle and a cup provided upon my request nice and friendly staff great choice for the price ,1

 enjoyed use of club lounge perfect for continental breakfast hotel not too big situation great for visiting many tourist sights would stay again ,1
 excellent location great room and facilities ,1
 the room was big and the air conditioning was noisy which meant i had to turn off the ac heating this then made the room cold in the morning the restaurant wasn t great the speed the food came out i thought i was at a mcdonald s not a good experience would not eat there again ,0
 location room breakfast choice,1
 lovely hotel and great staff very close to all attractions ,1
 the whole surroundings of the hotel and in particular the rooms were superbly furnished and catered for the view over the city was outstanding and the location you literally couldn t hand pick a better spot to explore everything in london ,1
 everything,0
 although i was a single business traveler i was put in a room with an interconnecting door to a family with small children this was not sound proofed and i could not work due to the noise at night i was woken up by the father snoring the bed was uncomfortable hairs in around the sink heating aircon sounded like an aircraft taking off this was the worst hotel room i have stayed in for years and i managed very little sleep,0
 the receptionist was incredibly rude to us on arrival make up marks on pillows and the television did not work ,0
 the wifi was very bad room service wasn t good,0
 facilities were not as great as i was advised i ordered milk for my twins and got charged 5 00 but was half a cup the rest was froth,0
 very nice hotel close to the underground shopping and restauraunts ,1
 small room no chair,0
 staff were so helpful nothing was too much trouble,1
 the whole experience also i won t use booking com again staff very unhelpful regarding card mix up,0
 stains on the bedding tv not working bath plug not working wrong room given to start with which saw us entering a room that was already occupied very awkward,0
 the room was very comfy and quiet,1
 lovely room no noise from adjoining rooms large modern bathroom with excellent shower ,1
 the bed was comfortable ,1
 great location and when the staff heard it was my birthday they had a cake delivered to my room which was a nice touch,1
 housekeeping very rude very unhelpful very non responsive all outsourced not hotel employees they speak loud no respect and not eager to make your stay happy no air condition available but not effective very hot inside rooms no refrigerators you can only use it to buy the high price cola one type of water tax they will ask you to pay high tax when you are leaving not clear in there offer ,0
 poor nights sleep due to loud droning and rumbling of large air conditioning unit outside my window hotel full so couldn t change rooms manager was useless and didn t address my problem or offer me any recompense awful stay i would not recommend ,0
 the building itself location and service,1
 beautiful old hotel good breakfast friendly staff ,1
 the reception staff when we arrived was extremely rude we found blood and dry wine on our bed sheets and it took them 1 hour to bring new sheets that we had a to change ourselves and did not offer any compensation outside of drinks durng the weekend you can hearthe sounds of the nightclub that is next door ,0
 great location and amenities ,1
 good service from arrival to departure very nice breakfast fantastic view from my room public transport to central london very close ,1
 reception staff is not kind enough for 5 star hotel i doubt it s real 5star hotel though spa facility is very poor no sufficient toiletaries provided no cotton balls no hair dryer no soap bar in the toilet tv didnt work for some menu ,0
 so old and two single beds make a double bathroom shocking,0
 staff should know the grade of disability access we needed wheelchair access without any steps up or down we did not stay at the hotel and booked another which had no steps and had full wheelchair access ,0
 housekeeping no water available at any time no toothpaste no slippers which means lots of basic equipment missing for the price of 240 euros per night ,0
 room was noisy as overlooked the air conditioning units on the flat roof the bed was extremely uncomfortable ,0
 small bathrooms,0
 the way we were checked in by mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special ,1
 staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating we were first given a room on the first floor room starting with 1 basement requested a higher floor and were moved on night two to a room on the second floor starting with a 4 for the rest of our stay they were apologetic for not being able to move us on the first night but it was not an issue as we were wiped out from traveling and the beds were extremely comfy first room was nice but very small although the loo was sizeable second room was more spacious and equally as clean we happened to visit during a warm spell july 20 25 16 and they provided us with ice promptly every evening upon our return great perk to have a real kettle in the room good water pressure in the shower mini shampoo etc provided if you forget don t want to bring your own we brought our own power converter but underestimated usage the lovely ladies at the front desk handed over an extra no deposit required bellman so sorry i cannot remember his name from bulgaria was so incredibly nice he truly went above and beyond location an easy walk to both lancaster gate tube and paddington station a bit off the beaten track which was nice because it was very quiet ,1
 we loved the fact that we were so close to the o2 as we were there to see bruno mars the hotel was great our room was fabulous and had fantastic views over canary wharf staff so friendly and helpful we will be back ,1
 the is currently renovation work being undertaken at hotel noisy building site noises form 8am to 6pm outside of hotel as scaffolding had to keep rooms curtains closed for privacy from builders avoid hotel may 2017 3 night stay,0
 surly receptionist when i checked in smallest hotel room i have ever stopped in literally 8 inches round the side of the bed all round no room for a table or anywhere to put my luggage there was only two foot height in the cupboard for hanging clothes so i couldn t even hang my jacket or trousers up shower room was ridiculously tiny couldn t properly sit on the toilet it was so narrow my colleagues and i were hoping this would be the new place for us to stop given its proximity to the office however i couldn t recommend it to anyone other than as a last minute booking if you get it cheap there is much better out there ,0
 ilthe room was very run down not worth the money it was very small and apparently we were upgraded to deluxe i would hate to think what a standard room was like even the toilet paper was so cheap and thin and i never complain about anything but will not stay here again if i can help it,0
 food was taste but they need more variety of it ,1
 service room,0
 only stay here if a loud fan in the room does not bother you even when i switched it off it was still really noisy the result minimal sleep not ideal when all you want is a peaceful nights sleep ahead of a busy day ,0
 staff were wonderfully attentive and polite nothing was too much trouble the free wi fi is always welcome at these hotels and the location to the o2 is great the sky bar on floor 18 is a must as it has a brilliant view across the thames ,1
 everything,1
 i liked the setting of the room and the cleanliness,1
 very helpful person on front desk,1
 great big noisy chimney type thing outside our room you could here it over the tv so i had no sleep was supposed to check in at 3pm but room wasn t ready so got in at 4 30pm i m disabled and needed to lay down and take meds whole room and bathroom stank of sewage phone didn t work breakfast was late and totally wrong also towel heater was broken shoddy and staff unhelpful now at holiday inn in canning town so much nicer and cheaper never ever stay there again,0
 stylisch room,1
 friendly staff clean rooms nice area around but heathrow express not far 5 pounds for a cab or 15 min walk,1
 they call themselves a hidden gem in london and that s very true it was my first visit here and it will not be my last ,1
 the staff were fantastic from the first minute we are a young couple so on first thoughts we didn t think we would fit in but we were treated exactly the same as anyone else the door staff were friendly and enjoyed a laugh as well the room as lovely although the shower wasn t the best it did what we wanted the location couldn t have been any better we were a tube station or two away from everything we wanted we highly recommend this place perhaps we will visit for another birthday next year ,1
 the staff were unfamiliar with the area of the hotel didn t have a clue what the bbc proms in the park was ,0
 excellent location staff were friendly no complaints about breakfast selection room was fantastic clean and tidy ,1
 stuff ignored complain about poor bed the room is too dark,0
 very very comfy bed marvellous bathroom spotlessly clean perfect location for o2 arena,1
 the air con wasn t working which made the room very stuffy no face towels shampoo or conditioners were given and we were only given flimsy paper cups ,0
 location staff and breakfast was super having laundry facilities was a bonus ,1
 bedrooms far too small bed very uncomfortable hotel very tired,0
 the building site out of my bedroom window the broken lift the rude unhelpful stuff and dated decor ,0
 terrible room in the basement minimal natural light felt like we slept in a cleaners cupboard the beds were on wheels so every time you lay down you moved half a metre across the room the bathroom was tiny to sit on the toilet meant you had one leg in the shower not impressed ,0
 the luxury room we stayed in the cost 176 per night without breakfast was no bigger than 7ft square it was absolutely ridiculous we had continuous buzzing noise all night and the towel rail was hanging off it was a total rip off ,0
 after years of passing 1 3 nights in paris i finally found a hotel i really like and where i will return this was my second stay here the location is excellent the room is larger and nicer than in most of paris hotels staff is friendly and helpful ,1
 far better decor compared to peers,1
 rapid check in rapid check out ev charging,1
 room and facilities,0
 concierge bernard particularly helpful wonderful location,1
 paying 15 to watch telly is disgusting when you ve paid to stay in the room ,0
 very clean friendly and helpful staff,1
 the staff,1
 room we booked was not available even booking 6 weeks ahead so got stuck in a twin smoking room that was horrid they told us to open the window the smell stayed with me all weekend and as a non smoker it ruined the trip the picture quality of the tv in room was unwatchable cables hanging out from the wall bad toiletries provided room looked like it needed a total refurbishment got a free meal in restaurant that was average but had to pay for drinks ,0
 the lower ground bedroom was extremely noisy which made it difficult to sleep the floor above the room creaked very loudly when people walked about and i could hear every word spoken by people in the room next door the shower box was uncomfortably small ,0
 we were charged 80 or 100 euro more than we booked the first two days were booked via booking com which is 225 euro per day and we are peomoted ungraded to the tower view for the third and fourth day according to pront desk lady 10 euro more per day but when we back home we wre charged nearly 1000euro as showed in rmb we know there is a deposit 50 euro per day but it should return to us bucause we did not use any drink or demage anything in hotel please check and return the amount accordingly ,0
 friendly and helpful staff,1
 being kept waiting to check in whilst 2 staff chatted behind me facilities look and feel tired and in need for refurbishment,0
 i have made a formal complaint,0
 ideal location staff very helpful quite luxurious hotel i would say ,1
 the total refurbishment of foyer breakfast area and spa the foyer was a building site we were given glasses of champagne on arrival and free breakfast in our room but this was small compensation i think we should have been informed of refurbishment before our arrival estimated price for 3 nights was wrong by 50 ,0
 the location is superb for anyone with business in paddington basin where a reliable brand is providing a consistent product which is supported by really polite and helpful staff ,1
 the rooms were very small and dated ,0
 the location suited us very well the staff were very friendly ,1
 staff was very rude to me my wife and our nanny not even a good morning not even looking up when we came by eg the reception im a frequent 5 star hotel customer and this was by far the worst ever experience morevoer one curtain fell during one night staff hang up on the phone twice unbelievable dont stay at the hotel ,0
 sink plugged and overflowed and air conditioning didn t work in first room hotel knocked about and needs repairs many broken fittings and damaged woodwork tables in breakfast room dirty front door broken the 3 days we were there ,0
 the courtesy shown by the team at the hotel for changing my room immediately as there was some problem with the wash basin and hence they gave us a better room,1
 the bed and the rooms were awfully small especially the one with the stairs it was ridiculous the showers in the bathroom were too short we had to bend down to wash our hair we could listen to everything outside of the room there arent any mirrors in the room not even slippers and the cleaning lady took a white dress my wife left on the chair mistaking it for towels and when i called they said they ll look for it and get back to me and that was it no feedback and i didnt get it back there was one elevator for service and customers and it was so slow we had to wait for it to come back empty so we could go up or down and the roof of the room was so short if i lift my hand i could touch the wall and i know there are many guys taller than me i think they should crawl around the room l the bed was small for 2 ppl and not comfortable and thats after we changed our room 2 times to find something habitable oh and dont bother spraying perfume youll get to the lobby and start smelling like lobster after that,0
 they had gave me the wrong room i had then asked to change my room they then said that none was available except emperor suite then went on to tell me that i would have to pay more if i want to move my room i explained out of good will i shouldn t have to pay because they had messed up my booking already for the rest of my stay here i was stressed and couldn t relaxed i was upset and disappointed as i had booked this hotel to celebrated my boyfriends 26th staff was rude wasn t helpful at all door handle on the bathroom door was broken there was a nail sticking out of the wall where the desk was unstable chairs for the dinner table in my room i had taken pictures and i will be emailing hr about this wasn t worth the headache or money spent not a 5 hotel,0
 rooms slightly on small side but amazing value and location excellent and right on the park super clean well maintained rooms and bathrooms ,1
 lovely view from room 830 comfy bed excellent service friendly staff superb locations no fault at all ,1
 rude staff cramped room with no window food left out and being attacked by flies no way to get rid of them as no window no hot water tired and dirty looks nothing like the photos on website ,0
 had this booked as a birthday present for a co worker agreed with the hotel in advance to be charged for the room from my card and also the hotel promised a box of french macaroons which never happened i have all email correspondence to prove to anyone that the hotel is nothing like to picture the communication is brilliant in email only not in real life and on top of that my friend has woke up in the morning with flooded toilet that was leaking somewhere from the back all night not to forget bland breakfast very very disapointed,0
 fantastic location excellent room bed great food,1
 we just love the old building and the bar area is so relaxing,1
 rooms way too small claustrophobic recommend paying a little extra and staying the hilton next to the station ,0
 grand victorian edifice just like a proper hotel should be very comfortable very clean very pleasant and helpful staff ,1
 the rooms and the toilets are soooo old,0
 the staff were young but extremely proffessional and helpful anna christina jana marina jose ,1
 great staff and good location nice and clean,1
 staff were smart extremely polite and helpful hotel was ideally situated for what we wanted to do and easy walking distance from kings cross ,1
 it was just excellent in every way,1
 we stayed here on our wedding night and the staff were incredible they treated us with such warmth and really made it feel special the room was wonderful and the breakfast delicious what really made it were the staff who were incredible recommended ,1
 location was very good for site seeing but very hostile with locals and very intimating with a riot or polital protest at 12am till 2am beeping horns and waving siran flags ,0
 fab breakfast fab beds clean sheets ,1
 the location west kensington is nearest by underground station the room is very small and old mini bar on the desk there were a few bottles of water some peanuts and chips when you remove it from the plateau it will charge you money so we took a look of it the see the macro s en put it back en there charge it very old shower took us and the staf 30 min to figure out how to turn the shower on very noisy no wifi in the room not worth it to have it called a hilton hotel,0
 loved the late night bar service,1
 despite 5 rooms being paid for in full in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what i don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid ridiculous one of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had we will not be using this hotel again ,0
 i thought i had booked the hotel near the tower of london so was disappointed when we arrived the hotel location was quite a distance from any sightseeing places and with the ferry that takes you across the river finishing at midnight we felt like we were on a curfew our rooms felt like loft conversions with slanted ceilings not great with a 6 4 husband and you could feel and even hear the springs in the mattress so no sleep for all the wrong reasons our alarm went off on the final evening of our stay with no explanation whatsoever to top it all off the towel rail was positioned behind the bathroom door so sprang back every time you opened the door causing injury on the last day to my arm ,0
 taking a 50 fee on top of the room rate tiny bathroom noisy street impolite argumentative receptionist ,0
 friendly polite efficient staff excellent breakfast lovely bathroom small but very good ,1
 no ac working fake double bed ,0
 nice big room and ensuite,1
 attitude of some staff ,0
 truth and return my money back,0
 bad reception the room is totally differnet from the pictures nosiy ,0
 the breakfast really good,1
 everything,0
 the staff,1
 good location great breakfast,1
 loved the location very close to two underground lines and hyde park ,1
 it was in the middle of no where no experience of london no help not friendly ,0
 the room is really small and has nothing to do with the pictures in the website when i arrived i was told that i was not going to stay in the main building but in a diferent one across the street but was never awared of that before the bed sheets have not been changed the closet was so small and had only 2 hangers and no drawer i had to keep my clothes in my suitcase the bed was terribly small ,0
 rooms are tired and smelly staff need better training ,0
 breakfast did not have any variety staff was not attentive ,0
 i had emailed the hotel prior saying it was my other halfs birthday and for them to organise something special for him and i didnt mind paying nothing was organised staff were not helpful location wise it is great but thats about it the rooms are really dated,0
 when you propose attractive rates would be appreciative if you would also mention that you are not going to sell rooms but couches where a toilet room is in size 60 x 60 cm and the room size is 200 x 240 cm not legal i m sorry to say ,0
 very clean and bed was really comfy spa facilities was also great,1
 rooms were horrible unclean bathroom tidy,0
 upon arrival you will be asked to pre authorise your credit card with an extra amount on top for alleged expenses that you might incur even though there is no minibar in the room this is a nonsense as the hotel has your credit card details and is protected in any event if you do not agree they will not register the check in reception staff were in don t care it s just my job mode this is a surprising policy for a supposedly higher level hotel it is far from a welcome to treat the guests as if they are potentially bad debtors in the interior it is a throwback to how offices looked in london in the 1980s the bed although described as a king size bed was too narrow for two persons sound insulation is non existent so you will have plenty of chance to hear lovers making love lovers making war children crying and the cleaning ladies cleaning aircon is a noisy ancient system that continues for 40 minutes after you switch it off but you will need it to stave off the chilblains there was a table stand only on one side of the bed normal practice would be to have one on each side as a final bit of context i have never before given a negative review and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but st paul s club quarters will not get another visit ,0
 beautiful hotel excellent location and super staff ,1
 great location comfortable and friendly staff,1
 shabby rooms no smoking room smelt of smoke,0
 no air conditioning for a global hotel brand unbelievably disappointing ,0
 the reception staff wrre unfriendly the room was not clean ,0
 the lift was broken that enable you to go to the leisure club so the alternative was to go out of the hotel down 2 flights of stairs through the underground car park it was absolutely freezing also i had to carry my daughter down two flights of stairs an absolute nightmare the main reason we chose this hotel was for its leisure facilities i understand that this was an issue that was out of the hotels control however the manager on duty at the time was totally unsympathetic and kept saying it was out of their control i knew it was out of their control also the beds were too soft so we had backache ,0
 view from the site was excellent location to attractions was first class,1
 not like four star just like one or zore no poor no poor no poor but i saw they have the poor on booking they are liar no worth the price ,0
 the service was baddest which i have been to the hotel i just want one bottle of drink water take2day get one bottel and no refill the coffee pag as well,0
 stay away from the prison cell nightmare that is room number 1 no windows shared with service entrance constantly has door banging all hours of the night loud voices the whole experience was a claustrophobic nightmare the hotel was lovely maybe it was me as a person who got slammed out the back away from normality haha seriously squash room number 1 no english breakfast however stated and confirmed before arrival ,0
 really disappointed with the room the hotel staff and the experience overall the shower was cold the bed was uncomfortable the staff were rude i felt this was extremely over priced for what we got comparatively we stayed in another hotel for two nights and had a wonderful experience there ,0
 lovely classic style of hotel good location for central london,1
 amazingly friendly staff from checkin until check out quiet room requested and received delicious fresh breakfast in wonderful old ambient building,1
 staff helpful and polite bed comfy storage of luggage for the day of leaving easy accsess to underground and open spaces breakfast well presented and good,1
 its situated in red light district at night there were prostitutes standing right outside the entrance of the hotel breakfast is extremely bad with hardly any options room is very small with a very tiny bathroom unfriendly staff and poor service,0
 perfect location,1
 great friendly staff with welcoming atmosphere at a wonderful hotel upgraded our room because this was our honeymoon night so made even more extra special ,1
 nice area and quiet we weren t woken up by traffic even though our room overlooked the road excellent location for exploring london nice to have a large shower and underfloor heating the staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 very good located ,1
 the receptionist was very polite and helpful he couldn t do enough for us the room was large and comfortable there was nothing more we could have asked for there was everything we could have wanted for breakfast the hotel was very close to the o2 ,1
 they tried to convert the payment into euros at a very unfavourable rate without asking if we want to pay in euros or not i recommend all overseas guests to keep an eye on this ,0
 reception staff were poor on handling booking room wasn t ready when got there wasn t pre warned about 30 deposit prior drinks receipt was opt in tip however wasn t previously told this they just assumed bed very uncomfortable executive room was poor value for money small had balcony but apparently wasn t allowed to open door bathroom very basic tried to charge us for minibar when didn t even use it tried to take money from credit card without checking first executive lounge continental breakfast wasn t very nice hash browns were dry and barely warm plug near bed was faulty no window to open for fresh air extremely disappointed would not stay here again even if we was paid to and very unhappy about spending close to 200 for a room when i have stayed in 30 rooms that are better ,0
 great location modern interior staff very helpful ,1
 some of the reception staff were unfriendly uncooperative and in one case downright rude he chose to ignore the fact that i was the customer and was most dismissive of the fact i was requesting one of the facilities to which i was entitled through my elite guest membership i will never use this particular hotel ever again ,0
 the staff were extremely welcoming and accommodating to us they upgraded my friends room as it was his stag do and gave us some free shots when we arrived at the bar i would definitely come le back here again ,1
 the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable the bathroom products were of good quality ,1
 location is what it is but was not great access was tough and hard to find especially for taxi drivers the hotel is not 5 even if i owned it and was trying to big it up i would be embarrassed to called it 5 the place was badly designed grubby and had a whole host of random pieces of furniture everywhere very odd the rooms were not very clean badly maintained and corners had obviously been cut in every aspect sure signs of a hotel not making money or management who simply don t care very poor ,0
 a tiny noisy room very deceptively photographed ,0
 breakfast was good and worth the money personnel gave us 25 discount every morning ,1
 excellent location for the o2 arena gorgeous hotel ,1
 i didn t like everything rooms were extremely dirty we found some blood in our bed cover a lot of dirty stuff in the ground they don t give a slipper no complementary water this hotel is trash i would rather pay 100 pound more to live in a better place is much more worth it,0
 room is very small and very cold,0
 breakfast was good staff helpful and considerate,1
 the beds were hard pillows terrible room very small and shower had limited space and hardly any storage,0
 to begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after it has undergone some major renovations since i last stayed there the new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property super impressed with the park and the way nature comes together with the hotel new dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing ,1
 the staff could be more helpful with our situation we put wrong date for stayed and have been charged and now i have to stay somewhere else for extra money me and my girl were looking forward to celebrate our birthdays in style and close to the venue,0
 room very outdated and pool and gym were an extra cost that was not mentioned on booking food was terrible in the restaurant and the local restaurants were a good 2km walk away ,0
 the room was small too noisy and the bed very short ,0
 the check in and out was a little slow and not having coffee machine working in the open area was disappointing also the noise from the generators outside the bedroom at night was loud ,0
 pure dissapointment i booked the penthouse apartment with a terrace room was dirty the bed on the terrace was missing mattress and lighting was not working when i wanted to contact manager the reception told me that it is a weekend and they are not allowed to give the manager contact number to the guest and they can do nothing they did nothin for 3 days and never get back to me,0
 place was very clean and they have added a few amenities like how water pot and coffee very nice staff,1
 the staff were fantastic excellent service,1
 room too small they wanted to invoice me more than i paid on booking com eventually lady at reception called someone and then all was okay yet quite annoying such lack of organization,0
 the hotel charged me for 3 rooms each at 205 for the same night after the booking system crashed without issuing a confirmation and i had to try again hotel completely disinterested in refunding the 410 extra they charged me after an obvious problem with the booking system hotel is too automated to care about actual customer service,0
 great location friendly staff ,1
 staff so friendly and accommodating ,1
 we were given a tremendous welcome by the staff as it was my partners birthday they left us a personal note some chocolates and some wine and soft drinks in the room very welcome after the morning s travels when we arrived back to the room that night there was some birthday cake waiting for her it was a lovely personal touch and very much appreciated ,1
 very rude staff full of ,0
 staff were so friendly and attentive great customer service ,1
 attitude of staff when asked why so much,0
 i said i come late and they mark as no show i arrived in the morning and paid cash they sent me an email to pay for the no show ,0
 it is certainly not the mercure level you can expect ,0
 great location,1
 great staff spacious and meticulously clean room breakfast started as early as 6 am very close to metro station except constant plumbing noises heard in my room ,1
 very friendly and efficent staff excellent conciege service,1
 no breakfast facility the bathroom shower was set up as a wet room and flooded the bathroom hand basin was tiny like the type in a small toilet thus nowhere to place your toiletries soundproofing against continuous construction work in the street was poor i would not recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
 noisy rooms as not soundproofed from either internal or outside noise and air con unit woke us up at 4 30am in the morning with a loud rattling for 20 mins the air in unit was switched off at the time despite making a complaint to hotel they have not bothered to respond so will not be using the mercure hotel chain again,0
 overall hotel was centrally located and close to tourist attractions staff were courteous and helpful with information and very welcoming,1
 firstly the entrance to the hotel is pretty awful the lift works when it feels like it the amount of stairs in the hotel was an issue carrying cases up and down the first night we arrived the air con didn t work in our originally booked triple room the room was stifling we complained to the night receptionist who moved us to a room on the top floor which was then only a double room no single beds so my friend and i ended up sharing a bed the breakfast was not delivered on either morning we had to ask for it each morning the staff were not at all approachable the night receptionist did not inform the day shift that we had moved rooms all in all it was pretty shambolic i will never stay in a best western hotel again will i use booking com again not sure ,0
 location of this hotel was perfect most of the sights that i wanted to visit can be visited on foot the room was comfort somerset house was in 7 8mit on foot staffs were friendly ,1
 we did not received warm welcome the reception staff speak so rude we did prepaid our room under my name after given them the passport they need to see credit card also and strongly insist with tone voice i don t like it when register with passport it s enough very bad management put me in the room next to elevator bad breakfast in a small room 1 floor every customer need to follow the host to be seated you may feel like you are in bording school annoying sound of staff i wonder how you rate this hotel 4 stars ,0
 doesn t care about the customers,0
 small rooms and meagre breakfast ,0
 we enjoyed the little extras eg tissue box set in marble under the sink washing line discreetly fixed over bath etc,1
 the bed was terrible nosiey and when we questioned it we were told there was nothing they could do about it the food on the buffet was always cold no matter what time you went pancakes were like cardboard and the coffee old the rooms were not replenished daily and things were falling off the walls in the bathroom at night waking you up ,0
 perfect for going to o2 back exit of hotel takes you straight into the arena lovely rooms and staff were really helpful going back in january and glad i booked there again already especially good when leaving arena as tube taxis are a nightmare we were out and back in our room in minutes ,1
 no windows in the room no room keys given had to be escorted to the room everytime over priced 4 not a chance ,0
 the front offfice staff and the food,0
 noisy dark rooms fruits from breakfast spoiled personal didn t realy care the spa sauna and steam bath very small and dirty just no fun at all absolutely too expensive for what you get ,0
 an array of delicious choices for breakfast lovely informative and helpful staff lovely bath and shower glorious bed perfect for o2 speakers in bathroom lovely view ,1
 the view was amazing staff very pleasant and efficient,1
 reception staff were unhelpfull and no show of appreciation ,0
 everything was perfect facilities views proximity to the o2 was amazing and breakfast was great quality with loads of choice will definitely return we live in london but just wanted a nice local weekend away from our usual surroundings thanks especially to oscar for all his help at check in ,1
 bad service not well clean stuff frowned,0

 fantastic location for shopping and to be reached early by metro from major trains stations friendly front desk staff clean and freshly renovated bath rooms,1
 hidden charges,0
 the staff were perfect,1
 everything room disgusting booked an upgrade for my anniversery but should have booked a traveldoge as much better would like a full refund ,0
 rude management who had absolutely no sense of sympathy in a unique circumstance extremely bad pr and over all no loyalty to paying costumes,0
 average good accommodation big room helpful staff room cleaned daily big hot shower comfy bed ,1
 very very very small room you hear all noises from other rooms and corridor there were no renewing of shampoo during 4 days of stayin in the hotel,0
 staff were really friendly location was great for morning runs in the park,1
 small bed more expensive than pricing provided by booking com noisy ac impossible to sleep bedroom with no windows in the cellar,0

 too rude personnel at the reception ,0
 the room was tiny outdated and breakfast was cold rubbery and i was there at peak time not as about to close overall value for money was appaling ,0
 excellent staff and service lovely rooms and excellent food in indigo,1
 frankly i would never recommend this hotel to anyone despite it being ideally located i paid an extra 100 on the spot to be upgraded to a king bed room but found myself on the first floor overlooking the courtyard in a ice cold room where the wifi didn t reach the bed so i paid something like 30 for a poor internet that barely worked in the bathroom the staff were nonchalant apart from the concierge and my room smelt like mold like i said would never recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
 rooms were appalling staff were bewildered no heating black mold on wet surfaces no spoon to stir tea coffee tv facing wrong direction to watch nowhere in shower to put soap or shampoo ,0
 the location was exactly what i wanted the room was comfortable and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful with on site parking i would use these facilities again ,1
 extra friendly staff and a free room upgrade best room i ve had in london wish i could have stayed a week location works well in a tidy and upmarket area would recommend ,1
 staff was very friendly located ten minutes from the underground which was nice ,1
 stylish modern rooms and artsy public spaces though small the rooms are nicely kitted out with colorful decor and the rainfall showers are wonderful location on the place de la sorbonnie with its lovely fountains is very pleasant ,1
 location was fantastic,1
 very friendly staff lovely hotel very nice room and service throughout ,1
 bed extra comfortable and staff extremely helpful,1
 we had high expectations travelling 200 miles to the hilton metropole to be greeted at check in to be told we had to settle for a smoking room as there was no other choice and if we didn t like it we would have to down grade from a deluxe king room to a single room was a disgrace we settled in the end for the smoking room as we had very little option to do otherwise and although the views from the room where quiet impressive the actual room was no more impressive than a premier inn a massive dissappointment from start to finish ,0
 super clean rooms complimentary tea and comfortable bed held our bags so we could sightsee without carrying ,1
 the mattress was bumpy without a matress protector just a sheet the windows looked like they had not been cleaned in years extractor fan was not walking in the shower power sockets difficult to reach ,0
 breakfast buffet was great with the option to request a specific dish,1
 comfy bed friendly staff close to tube ,1
 room was the size of a shoe box bed length was from wall to wall i couldn t stretch and had to lay in semi curl position if you are over 5 10 you will struggle breakfast was very poor,0
 there was no butter with toast tea was cold overnight parking rate to 9 00am so had to check out early or pay extra 6 00 overall the hotel was tired shabby and not worth the high cost ,0
 very nice hotel great location quite room and fast service check in check out concierge i would like to return ,1
 the room had a very bad smell when we entered the passage area to the room was very narrow and finding the lift from the floor was very difficult its an old dirty hotel the staff was very rude the room was very dark and dull ,0
 location perfect bed a dream staff outstanding loved the fruit cookies small cakes left in our room each night the box at the front door of the room for the papers each morning was a nice touch ,1
 exceeded all expectations ,1
 polished is the word that comes to mind simply excellent in every way wasn t expecting such a friendly personal service from a large hotel will definitely recommend and visit again ,1
 exceptional clean room great location friendly staff nice welcoming l like it tooo much the room was amazing all staff were helpfully and friendly every things was amazing i really recommend this hotel for all my friend ,1
 the entire hotel was spotless with the most friendly and professional staff a faultless stay ,1
 very friendly staff excellent accommadation,1
 location was excellent the hotel bar was comfortable service good and food great bathroom was nicely appointed with luxurious towels ,1
 well located between tube stops for many different lines the room is tiny but well thought out to be well equipped the staff were really friendly pleasant surprise considering the very good price ,1
 location and price,1
 the location was great and the hotel was very clean and comfortable with a lovely shower very happy with our stay would stay again ,1
 terrible hygiene issues,0
 the ac didnt work the staff told us that they can help us change the hotel but they cant fix the ac we were tired so we just slept there with the windows open worst 4 star hotel ever if you go there make sure you check the rooms before hand they charged us a week ago for the booking and yet they didnt care or checked the room before we checked in the staff is really slow too ,0
 the hotel was luxurious with large comfortable beds and good pillows as it was away from the main tourist areas it was quiet at night so good for sleeping the breakfast was varied and very tasty with the hot breakfast made to order from the menu it was possible to walk into covent garden within 10 15 minutes which meant many attractions and restaurants were easily reachable an excellent base for a good week stay with interconnecting rooms for the family ,1
 stinky bath towels really stinky concierge seriously it s okay to smile sincerely and be friendly put slippers in room you are after all a 5 star hotel you concierge could use some a lot of help with there approach and robotic service no personality very fake and whatever type of response i switched from a belgravia hotel thinking i would get the same service as both are supposedly 5 stars i should have stayed in belgravia this w isn t a 5 star hotel bath towels stunk all of them everyday so showered and had to air dry as i didn t wish to smell like a stinky towel i was completely taken aback by this location as i stayed in the w nyc and it was quite nice i was unaware of the pride festival going on the day i checked and your concierge was no help at all with helping me get to the hotel that was a turn off right away i could go on but why bother you have lost me as a customer it s like an updated modern motel for the selfy generation p s all around your staff are snobs and only cater to the wanna be party hollywood type crowd pity is what it is ,0
 just a lovely hotel with lovely staff ,1
 clean comfortable but not special,1
 location and cleanessnes,1
 excellent location and excellent property clean spacious rooms ,1
 having to pay extra for breakfast after paying 255 a night continental included but having to pay extra for full english,0
 design hotel ideally located close to both the porte maillot convention center and the champs elys e area very helpful staff even before and after end of the stay ,1
 staff are brilliant i book here several times a year they always remember me ,1
 a we had to change our room 3 times before we got one that was even close to being habitable b first room carpet torn and heavily stained the bed linen appeared to have been used before c bedroom 2 the mattress was old and the edges were only 5 deep and broken down it was also very stained with blood and bodily fluids no proper mattress protector and the four pillows were thin 2 and old d throughout our stay we spoke to the head of housekeeping a number of times regarding the quality of the rooms and she informed us that almost all the rooms were in this condition it was only thanks to her intervention that we finally were moved to a room that was satisfactory e the hotel was tatty and run down in appearance our understanding from your website that this hotel has a 4 star rating sadly this is not the case f since we selected this hotel on the basis that we were booking 4 star accommodation we are prepared to pay the full price for the two nights where the room was satisfactory however we feel that a full refund for the three previous nights would be appropriate g the above were the main issues more listed below 1 duvets wafer thin 2 odd cups chipped 3 bathrobe one for 2 people 4 unfinished furniture in room no doors on armoire 5 all paintwork chipped and damaged 6 peeling wallpaper etc etc photographs are available if required we look forward to your early response john and jan summerfield,0
 the room had a smell of mold ,0
 lovely staff so helpful especially diana,1
 bed was very hard wifi was very poor,0
 my sister slept all night for the first time in months the staff were wonderfully helpful pleasant friendly we will stay there again next year ,1
 location,1
 good location close to tube walked to kendington chelsea and portobello road market notting hill wifi ok given age of hotel concierge looked after our bags when we checked out until later on sunday when we left for home,1
 the bathroom was flooded it was awful avoid the hotel at the moment it needs the plumbing fixing and at 500 a night you would expect more,0
 air con in the room was rubbish didn t sleep well at all generally wasn t clean toilet was filthy marks up doors tried to have a nice drink outside by the bar but customers were shouting and making it very uncomfortable did t get the warmth feeling you wish to have on arrival all very dull lighting in the room was terrible room was situated outside the main street so couldn t open curtains ,0
 fantastic staff very professional management,1
 breakfast was really poor and when something was finishing they were trying not to replace it they provided us only one small bottle of shower gel for 2 persons and 4 nights the room was really small,0
 we loved the location close to many attractions that we went to see as well as the cenotaph ,1
 staff were rude myriad of additional charges,0
 the beds were amazingly comfortable and the room was just the right temperature during a very hot night breakfast was good ,1
 the door staff were very helpful the room was spacious and clean fantastic ,1
 the bed was very comfortable and our room very spacious we arrived on an early flight and we re lucky enough to check in early the hotel is in a great location for sightseeing easy access to waterloo or westminster stations and close enough to walk to lots of things if you have the time we have stayed here before and would definitely stay again ,1
 the room was small and the condition was average e g the carpet in the room and in the hallway was worn most unsatisfactory was that the air conditioning only worked when turned to 5 degrees which it didn t actually get anywhere near and only with the fan speed going full blast all night the result was a warm and noisy and not very restful night ,0
 breakfast was fab bernard concierge took very good care of us ,1
 paid for an upgrade at 50 and was not upgraded room was changed on the second day and when we went into this room we found someone had left a solid present in the toilet not great was not happy with how it was handled and is still going on 2 3 weeks later ,0
 extremely friendly and helpful staff very good breakfast selection and great value would definitely stay here again ,1
 the dated tired decor and bored staff,0
 the bed and the location of the hotel was good ,1
 awful they gave me a room without window i didnt know it was possible ,0
 there was a connecting door if you wanted a connecting room even though we didn t want a connecting room the door was still there and open at around 2am next door was drunk and very loud and barged through the connections door screaming because they were drunk the staff did nothing and when you re paying over 600 for 2 night it s not good for a good couple it s too posh to feel comfortable wouldn t return ,0
 there was some machinery type of noise that i reported to the front desk but not much could be done about it and so i have restless and disturbed night,0
 it was amazing to go to the hotel after a full day of chaos at the heathrow airport and our flight to sa being cancelled we were tired and had no baggage with us the hotel staff were very sympathetic to our situation and assisted us in every way they could provided us with dental kits and even plasters for the blisters ,1
 well equipped nice room traditinal but modern building ,1
 this is an excellent hotel location is amazing just minutes from earl s court tube station but so quiet you can t believe you are in the centre of the city we could easily walk to kensington high street hyde park natural history museum etc excellent shower phenomenal water pressure room was clean bed was very comfortable staff excellent very friendly and able to provide lots of recommendations for sights and restaurants breakfast was very good the hotel restaurant is good too a good alternative if you are back late from a tour or too tired to go out we will be back ,1
 very friendly staff ,1
 the bed was pure luxury and room very clean ,1
 they had to move us because the air conditioning wasn t working and up charged us for the room because it was a different bed then they had to move us again when the electricity in our floor wasn t working they blamed us for the electricity in the building going out but our adaptor for our iphone was fried and they refused to replace it unless i provided a receipt the door didn t lock in our third room properly and we had to make sure that we pulled it shut numerous times so it would close lastly after fighting with them about our bill and the charges we checked out of the hotel and left our luggage as were weren t leaving until the evening when we returned many hours later to collect our luggage they presented us with another bill which they said they had forgotten ,0
 the rate room is too hai,0
 location and food was very nice,1
 the room was small the hotel was very dated,0

 the best hotel we ever stayed in the staff were knowledgable about the food and wine very friendly and very chatty checking in was super easy and reception staff were lovely fabulous spa and gym facilities so close to the o2,1
 bedrooms and the style of the hotel staff are lovely and the hotel is comfortable easy to find off fleet street and close to major sights,1
 all the workers and services are below the standard of the name of the hotel,0
 everything,0
 the room was very well equipped very clean and comfortable ,1
 flash entrance shabby rooms rude reception manager ,0
 i don t like rooms is all and and comfortably they need change and refurnished to all the rooms and levels ,0
 the photos were nothing iike the real thing the hotel was really shabby plastic plants outside a dirty building old cheap tatty furniture wardrobe doors that would not open mini fridge that could nt be opened without being on your knees to plug in and was empty trouser press hanging dangerously off the wall and dirty blinds up the windows window over looked rear of hilton hotel who had very noisy deliveries and bin collections ,0

 clean spacious room friendly staff and good food ,1
 very bad smell and also no heating at all 10 c outside 15 c in the room,0
 the advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself the check in was delayed by about 15 minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room very poor check in and unproffessional no sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water there is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with the access to the internet on the tv is blocked very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price ,0
 the property was under construction very loud and dusty breakfast in the unfinished lobby area ,0
 everything horrible place,0
 hotel tub does not drain quickly staff not courteous hotel not clean was very dissapointed hotel is overated,0
 our room was dark and dingey it was stiflingly hot with no a c the room was old with an ancient dark wood bed frame with chips and scuffs in the woodwork the hotel itself was ratty with torn paintings and paint falling off the woodwork getting a snack after 11 pm was greeted with hostility in spite of their boasting 24 hour service we paid over 350 a night for substandard service and accommodation i recommend the milestone ,0
 reception desk is excellent and location is excellent,1
 we have been coming to the russell hotel for several years and for us it is a very comfortable hotel with good service ,1
 the room was too small and the windows was facing a wall,0
 fab bed huge and comfy,1
 the bed for our daughter was an old sofa bed it offered no support and was completely inadequate we were not offered a suitable alternative so we left the hotel has refused to refund us ,0
 evry thing was wrong cold room dark room no refrigetor in room no ac evry thing was baaaaaaad very bad,0

 breakfast,1
 small and relatively old room calc on the bathroom floor shower door would not even stay still and open close as you shower loud had to disconnect the minibar to fall asleep doorman was not exactly the friendliest based on what i ve noticed from the corridors and my own room the whole hotel is need of renewal refurbishment ,0
 good position for sight seeing good breakfasts great staff,1
 1 they made me wait for a hairdryer for almost 2 hrs and a half and because of what they have done i missed on my antibioticbecause i had no breakfast as i was waiting and could not go down with wet hair and morning shopping i have then asked to talknto the duty manager and the guest relations were put on the line and they have promised to get pastries to the room and i waoted for 1 30 hour and got nothing i then went down to the reception and asked to see the duty manager which told me they were sorry and i need to think of a way they compensate me in i have then asked for a late check out and theyvhave surprised me with checking in another guest to the room while i was in bed this is by dar the worst hotel i have styed in in london,0
 bed and size room,0
 friendly staff very helpful rooms were very nice and tidy ,1
 the breakfast choice was excellent and well stocked throughout the serving period ,1
 staff were friendly and nothing was too much trouble great value for money and excellent location ,1
 the room was too small and had steep steps inside the room the bed was small specially duvet was very small ,0
 spacious room with extra large and comfortable bed large bathroom with excellent rain shower above bath with plenty of hot water all you can eat breakfast included in room price catered for all tastes and the largest of appetites ,1
 the room is way too small the fridge doesn t cool had a booking for oct 10 but canceled it will certainly never go back ,0
 the hotel is not located in a very good neighborhood the poor man at the front desk was not well informed as it was only his second day and he was completely alone and didn t even have access to things like towels we reserved a twin room and when we got into the room it had one double bed when we went to the desk he said they had no other rooms but then he thought we could change with someone else who also had problems with their reservation we then had to wait to swap rooms with a couple who actually requested a double bed but they had already been in the room and there was no housekeeping to tidy the room or to provide fresh towels so we had to swap towels and toiletries ourselves the beds were very small which made for an uncomfortable night they claim to be a four star hotel but they are far below that ,0
 the bed was amazing the room was clean and tidy and the view was great,1
 helpful staff specially mr farouq at the receiption and the hotel location ,1
 bad organization of check in process more than 30 minutes waiting the shower is fixed the size of the bathroom was bigger than the size of the room no mini fridge in the room the towels were shabby in general the hotel is overrated,0
 one of the staff was quite bossy ,0
 fantastic breakfast,1
 feel the room design is too dark and not good smell water is a bit small,0
 service in the bar was quite poor there was one guy who was struggling we had ten in our party and had to wait quite a while for another client to pay their bill ,0
 to be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish we arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty my husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving we had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow i am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary ,0
 no gym even though listed no quiet room even though at booking it stated it was on the courtyard as it was it meant i was woken by traffic at 6am not a place to sleep which is the main point of a hotel ,0
 greeted very warmly by the lady in charge of the dining room this was our second visit in 3weeks and she remembered that my daughter required gluten free breakfast great quality produce for continental and cooked breakfast very well trained attentive pleasant waiting staff a happy workforce working very well as a team excellent very attentive reception staff great welcome and we re delighted to be upgraded to a juniir suite which was very spacious with a lovely view of the green square very quiet ,1
 poorly maintained no lightning in hallways room was full of junk to buy ,0
 great value for the money in london nice big room and family friendly accommodations ,1
 tiny room no character soul less common areas,0
 rooms were great with lots of space to put clothes away and good cupboard in bathroom good coffee facilities and fridge to put own drink ,1
 breakfast were really delicious with an excellent choice of temping offers loved the spacious well appointed room,1
 the location style flowers food staff size of rooms beds ,1
 i thought that the staff were great they took the time to listen and help me when needed ,1
 customer service the broken fixtures the wrong meals delivered expensive rooms very disappointed,0
 the reception on arrival was dire absolutely hopeless it tainted the whole of the stay ,0
 the bed was fantastic i can t remember the last time i slept so well ,1
 bed so uncomfortable springs sticking in me if your going to use cheap mattress use bed toppers old tired hotel but quite good position,0
 uncomfortable bed pillow windows didn t open and air con was very poor shower flooded entire bathroom and fell off wall continually when spoke to reception rude stated it s hand held only didn t say that in their description of facilities breakfast was horrible and general cleanliness in dining room poor,0
 the room was horrible and the bed was uncomfortable we were told they would call us when the room was ready so at 4 20pm we arrived back only to be told our room was unavailable because of maintenance we asked to speak to the manager and the receptionist went to get them only to come back with another excuse direct from the manager this made me think the manager was pretty gutless hiding out the back the decor is terrible we were shown a new room with a view like the one we originally booked and upon arrival the window had so much condensation you couldnt see a thing i advise anyone wanting a luxury stay or even a nice stay avoid this hotel i have stayed in a lot of hotel from 3 5 stars and this would be the worse i have ever been in ,0
 unkind staff poor facilities just bread and jam for breakfast not worth paying ,0
 quaint little hotel everything was clean and comfortable staff very helpful ideal area from which to walk to most places air conditioning was good best wifi i have experienced in years 49mg at least ,1
 3 bookings made 2 out of 3 wrong charged for a cancelled booking where no fee was due chairs etc in one room very very badly stained no one at hotel could handle complaint as they were all in a meeting mmmmm ,0
 all staff from front of house to the chambermaids were pleasant and extremely helpful,1
 noisy hotel small room was extremely small,0
 la situation,1
 staff were useless hotel room had a huge hole in the wall and the bathroom door didn t close room was freezing cold at night ,0
 customer service excellent and breakfast excellent staff very polite and helpfull,1
 fabulous pool great for marathon my son was running excellent pleasant staff especially helpful was andrei on reception great shortcut to o2 a fabulous stay and i would use again ,1
 look of the building and location,1
 a great stay warm welcome at 10pm this was my third stay the room was comfortable breakfast as usual was a sizeable spread and the service efficient the left luggage facility is a great boon will come back again next year ,1
 rooms breakfast room no wifi connection,0
 i didn t like the way the staff treated us no manager around they didn t have the same type room that we had paid for so they downgraded our room and never paid us back the difference in the price they kept changing our room the maids just made up the beds and never cleaned the room or never left any supplies of towel bath supplies or tea and coffee in the room ,0
 the room was stunning the beds were like sleeping on clouds the tassimo machine was a lovely touch the bathroom spacious spotlessly clean and super modern the staff were incredibly attentive helpful and efficient my son and i have vited it the best hotel we ve ever stayed in ,1
 from arrival staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was excellent our room was first class spacious well appointed and with a good view ,1
 standard room not 4 star standard quilt tiny not for 2 people,0
 for the price i paid i was expecting to have a foam mattress bed not spring topped with foam clean carpets ironed curtains i was also so surprised to see that the paid breakfast consisted only of cold eats like cereal pastries fruits and yogurts if you wanted a warm breakfast you had to pay extra considering the sheer amount of 4 star hotels in london i d never go back to this one ,0
 poor service from staff pre paid for hotel but charged a 60 deposit without being told on arrival room was very hot staff were not particularly helpful english wasn t great housekeeper walked into room at 9 30am without knocking the day before she didn t come until 4pm stale orange juice by the pool area small room with almost no wardrobe space and no drawers or cupboards for clothes poor value for money ,0
 location of hotel,1
 oh boy hotel is worn down full of families with kids breakfast area is so crowded that you may come to que for 20 minutes to get a seat location is far from tourist areas and the real parisian atmosphere won t stay again here before leaving the hotel my wife wanted to have a tea in the lobby the guy was so rude saying to her that he is not making any tea for 1 person he is busy and that she should go to any coffee shop in the neighbourhood for a croissant and a coffee we went straight to the shift manager who after listening to us promise to compensate us by refunding us the parking fee 47 which didn t happen not even now 3 weeks later you can judge by yourself btw entering the underground parking is really an achievement parking spaces are so narrow that only mini cars fit in just to be aware of but so is almost every parking in paris ,0
 the hotel was very dirty and had mice and no windows in the room we had,0
 very rude staff bathrooms filthy,0
 location cleaning staff ,1
 staff are very nice and helpful location excellent ,1
 great room good break fast friendly staff felt very relaxed ,1
 obviously i m am a able personal and i m 6 2 it it very challenging for me to stay in a physical challenge room i had to bend down all time when i was in the toilet and there is one hanger for the used towel when is next to the toilet bowl and obviously too low to hang a bathing towel it will be touch both the toilet bowl or toilet floor i need to hang the used towl on the door lock handle well it is not very nice to stay there for a able person and i didn t voice out as my deal was a 80 off from booking com is that all good deals are offering physical challenge room to booking com customers ,0
 the refurnished room was great the bed was comfortable the airconditioning actually works as hotel aircons are not very functionable ,1
 very small room tiny bathroom and that was an upgrade hairdryer in the bathroom taps and plugs etc in the bathroom needed replacing at least two of the lights didn t work very hot and air con too noisy to use biscuits were open and only one pack pillows were lumpy very expensive ,0
 location and breakfast excellent ,1
 everything,0
 night staff useless third class rating,0
 the staff of the restaurant was very rude when we tried to have a drink at the bar and the room was so small that you could barely walk,0
 great location great staff comfortable rooms ,1
"hey!   we returned home safely today october 10th 2019 -   i will start with the good -   the area is out of this world! absolutely breath taking ( unless they are building bridges or doing maintenance jobs ) personally it doesn’t bother me. lots of different places to eat if you can afford €18 for eggs on toast 😖! if not there is a shop called haba that you can order cheap dinners from! if your going to stay in zaandam and have intentions to smoke cannabis, i don’t recommend zaandam.   rooms are tiny! no kettle, tea bags, cups, nothing! just a bed and a tv..   we had a beautiful time here until someone on the 9th floor started attacking us, they tried coming into our room on two occasions and then started writing abusive things on our room door! we are a married couple that…",0
 nothing,0
 the room lg1 was a basement room below street level next to the hotel ventilation which was noisy at night not worth paying 140 euros per night for such an accomodation ,0
 comfortable beds pillows and comforters big bathroom with deep and nice bathtub and large separate shower luxurious bath products fun bar fri sat nights ,1
 wind noise on 4th floor very loud all night shower not powerful but as wet room style flooded entire tiny bathroom staff overall not as attentive as normally experienced ,0
 facility and service the room smells cash machine is broken no service what s so ever ,0
 absolutely one of the best rooms ive stayed in gorgeous and clean ,1
 location to hammersmith underground station,1
 nothing is good very bad smell not good food poor amount of food bad smell in rooms,0
 was over for euro 2016 stayed in nice and lyon hotel panache was superb best stop over for me very impressed with hotel and area loved it,1
 specifically booked a standard double room but got a very small room instead with hardly any space at all at a higher charge than the booking price on the booking com website a totally useless receptionist who said people have slept in that room before unhelpful staff tiniest room ever which wasn t what i booked and a non functioning a c summed up my stay ,0
 i arrived at 11 3o pm and they had no room for due to a maintenance problem ,0
 breakfast is really nice and with great choice all staff member are very friendly ,1
 too hot too expensive outdated putting optional gratuities on every bill without informing you,0
 very small rooms be careful pictures on booking don t reflect the reality in my room the flush in the bathroom was so noisy and wouldn t stop all night it is actually not a hotel just a accommodation so don t expect hotel services it is not comparable no services given single rooms are so small never book them no windows in the rooms or natural lighting old building ,0
 the breakfast was fantastic and staff very helpful ,1
 no hot water window at a construction place elevator didn t work room smells like sigaret bathroom for handicapped people wasn t comfortable,0
 how dirty the rooms are,0
 although the hotel was undergoing a refurbishment we still found it did not disrupt our stay in any way and the staff were excellent ,1
 rooms are very very small and only 1 elevator,0
 location staff courtesy,1
 amazing breakfast options and the staff were very friendly and helpful,1
 staff friendly swimming pool and good air con plus views brilliant ,1
 when adjusting for price this may be the worst hotel stay i ve ever had the room was tiny there was a service room next to my room which emitted a very loud and annoying noise at 6am the bar was small ,0
 the service and the room306 with horrible bathroom,0
 i specifically chose this hotel because it was close to our meeting the following day and your website stated there was parking which i understood to mean that there was off road parking there wasn t apart from that major inconvenience i didn t sleep well as the mattress was very hard the room was very small and there was a recurring noise outside the window every 5 or 10 minutes throughout the night which exacerbated my already restless sleep hard mattress bathroom door kept opening spontaneously and sink was a bit blocked more like 3 than 4 ,0
 the breakfast is very poor quality and the service terrible the food was like transport cafe food dreadful quality and at 100 00 for 4 shocking ,1
 filthy,0
 wonderful building great location excellent staff ,1
 excellent staff lovely room nothing to much trouble,1
 room was clean bed was comfy enough and big selection for breakfast ,1
 all the aspects regarding the room and the cachexia conference coffe breaks maybe not regarding you and the temperature in the conference rooms to warm ,0
 lovely hotel very clean and classy,1
 dirty very dirty ,0
 we stayed at the hotel for 5 nights hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes hotel is situated in a quite area the rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy the staff is very nice and helpful,1
 lovely hotel very well presented staff tried hardest to help you had everything you needed and breakfast was amazing ,1
 dirty uncomfortable and extremely shabby,0
 the bed was super soft ,1
 tiny room and i mean tiny literally just enough room for a bed lipstick on wine glasses 4 days in a row so not cleaned properly air con has one setting only arctic and loud ,0
 the hotel is beautiful and the flowers in the lobby are amazing,1
 the hotel is clean the staff is very friendly the room was relatively big so i had space to move around the staff is super friendly and the location is perfect the tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus for example you might think that being close to kings cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least 10 minutes and that s if you get the exit right switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location it s also located in front of russel square park which is very nice ,1
 the room seemed to be much smaller then how they appeared on booking com also other guests had the same feeling although the pictures are accurate just a little deceiving the bed was small we just fitted in their with the two of us there was no a c just a little fan that made more noise then actually moving air the window and curtains were dirty we could not control the room temperature the bathroom was ok small but clean ,0
 excellent location ,1
 i had asked for a quiet room and there was no mention of the building site literally on the doorstep the room was pokey and dark and straight off the reception area i had 4 shampoo miniatures but no conditioner or other standard tolieteries,0
 staff were really friendly got upgraded for free to a club room lovely and clean ,1
 the coffee in the room was a bit to strong but you can get coffee in any of the restaurantsame so not a problemember all the staff are brilliant i will be going back,1
 hotel was all good,1
 rooms are too small i picked two single bed room the rooms are not big enough for two single bed they only diveded the bed into two nothing a real two single bed room also staff were not able to solve any problems the check out took almost 40 min wasnt easy to pay money by credit card they were not well experienced,0
 the room is too small and the breakfast isn t variety also price it too high ,0
 i stayed here for a recent short business trip to london for 3 nights prior to a vacation in europe on the second night i was itching but couldn t pin down the cause well night 3 i woke up to a bed bug in the bed i took a picture of the bug and decided to see if there were more which i found on the mattress along the headboard something i had read about where they like to hide i complained to the front desk and showed them the pictures they dealt with it by being apologetic and offering me a free breakfast management said they d need to get a report from the pest control before any further action was taken i believe in giving people a fair chance to rectify the situation which unfortunately wasn t the case in this instance instead of following up promptly i had to email them and ask whether the report was filed i also had the huge inconvenience of having to launder all my clothes and spray out my suitcase on vacation for fear that the bugs got in there not only did they confirm that yes in fact they did find live bed bugs but basically that they can t identify the cause and basically insinuated that it could ve been my fault i was absolutely appalled by the treatment and lack of customer service no fault to the front desk staff but how management dealt with this was appalling ,0
 wasn t happy with staff,0
 over the top cost,0
 it took 30 mins waiting to check in we were puts miles away from main entrance on 8th floor in a very shabby part of the hotel the room itself was very very dated plug sockets did not work bathroom shower was full of mound ,0
 surroundings and comfort ,1
 this hotel is worth the money the room and the decor of the whole hotel is wonderful having been designed by kit kemp with an eclectic mix of items and furnishings which work so well together we ate at the brumus restaurant and enjoyed excellent ambience service and food breakfast was served here as well and again was excellently presented with good service the location is great being convenient for theatre land and areas such as china town and soho ,1
 we have stayed at many lovely hotels but this would have to be the best we have ever stayed at ,1
 didn t have breakfast,1
 250 for 1 night in a standard double room been in bigger rooms in an ibis or travel lodge for a 1 3 of the price the room was noisy heard every announcement from the train station tannoy also heard the very loud noise from the wetherspoons inside the station might as well been at the pub myself not trying to get a good night s sleep comoletely ruined our romantic night away ,0
 the room service was disgusting when we complained the staff were rude they tried to overcharge us for drinks and nuts from the mini bar which we had not had being alergic to nuts ,0
 the bed was great as was the water pressure an temperature ,1
 cheap hotel,0
 cold and very basic room with a bathroom just big enough to accommodate one person i would compare the room with a budget hotel in desperate need of refurbishment it raises the question whether you get the poor rooms if you book through booking com ,0
 quite a difference between photos and the real room we ve got no lift stairway mazes very small breakfast room,0
 the spa and pool were lovely especially being in central london afternoon tea charlie and the chocolate factory selection was delightful size of room and bathroom were very spacious i would definitely stay again ,1
 we 4 friends had booked a 2 bedroom apartment which was down in the basement no info on the website of that with a bunker feeling and a clear smell of mould we were offered a 1 bedroom apartment with a sofabed in replacement and the feeling from the concierge was that if we did not accept it we would not have anywhere to stay or had to go back in to the basement the apartment was poorly equipped so we did not even think about using the kitchen it was really cold in the apartment 18 so when inside we sat in the bed with our blankets on the breakfast we paid a lot extra for was not worth the penny for the same sum you get a full english breakfast at any cafe in the neighbourhood ,0
 bed was comfy lovely bath and shower food was good ,1
 we were given a tiny room on the ground floor next to the reception and kitchen the staff hardly spoke and breakfast was dreadful ,0
 aggressive staff not helpful bad facilities,0
 service is non existent did not even have my room cleaned very noisy,0
 we were upgraded to junior suite,1
 bed was very comfy room facilities very good,1
 everything was bad ,0
 never been in such a small room unacceptable for a 4 hotel no more than 50cm around a queen size bed felt completely cramed in the room it was difficult to even open our bags it was unbeliavebly small i regret not taking pictures to post here breakfast was less than medium again unecceptable for a 4 awful experience avoid ,0
 the walls were paper thin and we could hear the neighbours talking also to close the room doors people really needed to slam the door which was very annoying after 9pm having the room shake during this process wasn t fun ,0
 i had a tiny room in the basement i had to jump over my bed to get out of the bathroom nowhere to get any water to drink incredibly expensive for what you are getting regardless of the location probably the worst part of the whole stay was that the bed sheets and pillows were really really damp ,0
 really made it special for my niece,1
 location was good room size ok bathroom size ok,1
 the location of the hotel was perfect for sight seeing the hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful ,1
 always excellent reception staff who try hard to offer quiet rooms i always feel welcome and that s why i return it s very good value for the quality,1
 the hotel staff are really friendly the hotel is very handy for the tube station and is close to a number of shops and restaurants within walking distance ,1
 the room was tiny and very dirty the air con didn t work there was never any hot water for a shower in fact the knob just fell off there were stains all on the carpets the ceilings had damp also the walls were abysmal this was never in a million years a 4 star hotel i wouldn t never ever visit again luckily we didn t spend an awful lot of time here ,0
 paid for an executive double room and it was so small with tinted window view so very dark and not comfortable at all,0
 plenty of selection at breakfast attentive staff ,1
 food and the caffee and location,1
 we only stayed for one night but during the time we were there the staff were aver so friendly and helpful the room was clean and comfy and the location next to the 02 and train station made our stay just that more stress free,1
 our first room had scaffolding all over the windows we complained and were upgraded to a suite which was big but still with awful views over a noisy train line the bathroom had limescale all over it and the furniture was all chipped and broken we had a balcony a tiny pointless outdoor area only big enough for one person standing that was covered in pigeon poo didn t really add much to the view everything was just generally a bit tatty worn and tired very disappointing for a birthday stay especially for over 100 and with no breakfast even included ,0
 best hotel i have stayed at when visiting the o2 for location and accessibility the entrance to the o2 is via a short walkway next to the reception no queuing to get in ,1
 the staff was very accommodating and tried to help make my stay pleasant ,1
 perfect location nice room and facilities fitness sauna friendly staff ,1
 quiet hotel in convenient location very clean and recently refurbished nice bathroom with rainfall shower ,1
 very thing is great ,1
 location comfort cleanliness excellent,1
 the bed was very comfortable and the hotel was located very near the hospital which was ideal ,1
 no facilities at all and no lift,0
 washroom bathtub had an issue with water drain ,0
 room was too small,0
 poor staff poor gym poor room,0
 great location very close to the tube and bus routes,1
 on the 15th of august 2015 i was booked to stay at this hotel with my family as i mentioned to your receptionist at the time the accommodation was unsatisfactory in the following ways i had requested for an early check in as i was travelling with my wife and 3 young children 2 of whom are unwell at the moment with broker arms and other have stiches my request was refused on the day despite me having requested it even prior to my visit in an email and i have been inform by the representative that they are fully booked and cannot arrange any room till 2 00pm after requesting i was given accommodation a single room by hotel at my own expense 150 for just 4 hours that too it was a single double bed and we slept on that after complaining this to the higher management we got reimbursed on the check out day i have been given a apartment on the 3rd floor of the hotel without a lift this was not mentioned when i booked the hotel i would not have booked this hotel had i been made aware of these facts the stairs are very dangerous and with two handicap child it as not acceptable the washing machine was broken the a c was not working the room heater was not working the shower was broken the porter refused to carry my luggage up the stairs as he mentioned he was suffering from back ache yes he refused and this annoyed me when i requested to speak to the manager i was informed none of the managers were present to make decisions and i would have to wait until the following monday for any request to be entertained then they transferred us to the another room which as very very small in size and not up to that mark nothing was provided properly since the moment we arrived we have changed 3 rooms including one in kennington in just 12 hours and that too with children s and luggage ,0
 we couldn t enter our room 95 of the time as problems with the door lock the room wasn t very clean in terms of dirty windows and hair clips and nail clipping on the floor when we left for the day our room was meant to be cleaned and amenities refilled but only the towels and shower gels were replaced ,0
 perfect as usual ,1
 got fleeced for parking hotel is tired ,0
 room was tiny barely enough room for 2 extremely narrow single beds no air conditioning and a window that wouldn t open window was filthy and looked out onto scaffolding with strip light immediately outside and rubbish visible room was grubby claustrophobic and a disgrace for 250 ,0
 the hotel is needs a good refurbishing and improve amenities in the room,0
 there was an offer by the hotel on booking com when i chose it and set my dates it confirmed to me a totally different date thinking i was wrong i repeated the process but again the same result so i ended up paying for two nights at the same unwanted date i called the hotel but they told me that i have to call booking com i called booking com but they told me i have to call the hotel what a trap ,0
 the beds was really uncomfortable we first got offered a room with no window and then got changed to a room with a window there was a construction site right outside our window which woke us up at 7am with the building work the room was very dated ,0
 rooms are very very small,0
 the room was spacious and comfortable the location was quiet the hotel is in easy walking distance from the tube station which is on the piccadilly line so great for arriving from heathrow ,1
 everything room size location dirty rooms and bathrooms ,0
 there is a lot to improve here this hotel needs a huge renovation everything is old and not in a comfortable and artistic way starting from the furnitures the elevators floors and bathroom facilities it s definitely not a 5 star hotel and not even close to it the staff was not welcoming at all toilet amenities were cheap and of a bad quality the hairdryer was very old the carpeted floor was dusty even being at the 11th floor the room was very noisy i could hear the train and what the neighbour walking up the stairs the elevator would stop at every floor when going down and let s not talk about the breakfast very poor quality the fruit must have been there since ages and there is no coffee service i asked for an espresso and the waiter wouldn t even know what it was i am often in london but i will try to stay away from this hotel as much as it s possible in the area such an historical building should be much more evaluated and its potentially very nice furnitures really need a management who cares and understands international standards ,0
 staff was very good location great bed comfortable ,1
 excellent location brilliant service despite the building work taking place still the best hotel breakfast i ve had ,1
 i asked early check in didn t get it i asked late check out didn t get back to me on that and didn t get it asked to include breakfast and they charged me asked from the concierge from recommdetsiones nearby he told me that he is now in london and don t know places in london on the first day they didn t clean my room until 18 00 the key didn t work half of the time the servers where bad in breakfast,0
 very tiny room not even room to close the curtains extremely thin walls we could hear everything that was going on in the other rooms i did not think the room reflected the price ,0
 the staff were fantastic and the service was brilliant ,1
 dilapidated walls and scratched in room 215 when booking room picture with a large window standard room when at the hilton metropole they give you a room where in the window big gray wall ,0
 desperately in need of a refurb ,0
 beds great ,1
 luxury in the heart of london ,1
 the hotel is sparkling clean lovely breakfast spa nice view comfy bed ,1
 had a club room on the lower ground floor room had been recently renovated so was very nice and modern room was quiet and warm and had coffee tea hot chocolate making facilities staff were friendly and stored baggage for me couldn t really fault anything with this hotel i d stay here again thanks grand royale ,1
 service and room,0
 this was the worst hotel i stayed since my student days the room was tiny but more importantly in a terrible condition the bedding smelled and i had spread my clothes over the bed to be able to sleep the walls were covered with marks the carpet dirty it took me nearly half an hour to check in even though there was only one or two people ahead of me there is no way this is a 4 star hotel i would seriously question whether it would be classified as a 3 star either very disappointing ,0
 location,1
 food was dry and tasteless beds quite uncomfortable and should be changed sheets had holes musty scent in the air smells quite old no free internet outside of the lobby which even cheaper hotels provide everything seems to be diy or you pay a surcharge the staff refused to help with luggage and simply point to where the elevators are there was overall no warmth ,0
 the added extra s coffee toiletries slippers and dressing gown not forgetting the wi fi x,1
 the service of the front desk especially marianna was above and beyond very attentive and accommodating ,1
 small room not clean old bad smell,0
 tranquility and good service,1
 location of the hotel is very good and the kids gift is a nice idea specially the park plaza money ,1
 no parking room really undersized for the amount of money paid giving a raw burger from room service to my pregnant partner ,0
 great location cozy and convenient rooms ,1
 this is the 3rd time iv stayed here every time iv booked a late check out and every time i have been rudely awaken by maids knocking on my door numours times on my second stay i had a maid walk in 3 times while i had no clothes on i will not be returning ,0
 i didn t find my reservation as i did it the reserved apartment with fan not ac i took about 3 hrs to check in even i arrived 10 pm the reception employee was non cooperative and can t solve any problem the case was solved by my suggestion to give me 2 rooms instead of the apartment but one only was with ac and the other with fan so i am totally disappointed and never tell any one about this bad hotel,0
 uncomfortable beds room too hot windows don t open car parking system is enter your reg no at reception and pay for the number of days you re staying the problem is trying to extend the duration you either have to pay at a machine coins only or pay by phone which entails setting up an account and giving some anonymous person your bank details in the end i left and parked in west india quay for half the price ,0
 i was chosen as the guest of the day diego was great on the welcome desk my room was very comfortable and clean ,1
 room was not cleaned had to ring reception to have the room cleaned twice ,0
 not very accommodating ,0
 dirty rooms to the point you didn t want to take off shoes paint chips and massive cracks in the tiles both floor and shower leather on headboard and around tv was old and pealing room was tiny like harry potter under the stairs tiny ,0
 the apparently 4 star hotel is more like a bed and breakfast bedsit the initial room that i was allocated smelled absolutely terrible i requested to be moved and was initially told they had no more rooms i asked to speak to someone senior and then my request was honored once in the new room which was a slight improvement i noticed an unpleasant human deposit in the shower this is my first time writing a review based on my bad experience henry you have a lot of improving to do if you want to be king ,0
 excellent location all facilities in the room are in good shape new liked the old fashion feel of the place very close to 2 tube stations ,1
 the service was terrible they moved us to another room without telling us they just took our bags so when we got back the room had other guests already aside from that the elevators were so slow and the people weren t so accommodating,0
 i had requested a high external facing room and this was arranged lovely friendly staff,1
 i loved the stunning views from the bar on the 18th floor the breakfast was spot on and lots of choice ,1
 everything apart from poor service at breakfast,1
 bed on floor too low staff screwed up rooms and billing its was a mess from start to finish room still not ready at 5 30pm tried to overcharge for additional mystery room reservations all messed up even though we rang every day to confirm all was good for our clients they hated it and they travel a lot ,0
 customer service,1
 the staff were really great ,1
 given location i was expecting much smaller room size but very adequate for the 3 of us location meant we were short walk from all attractions ,1
 we made our reservation because of the offer they announced but we felt cheated as the hotel was under constructions saturday at 8 o clock in the morning the sound of a hammer woke us the room was also full of dusty because of this construction when we returned from having lunch they continued with the hammer unbearable i hardy don t recommend this hotel ,0
 this hotel absolutely needs a complete makeover it is old fashion smudgy and a lot of furniture is damaged ,0
 comfortable rooms excellent location friendly helpful staff ,1
 i always book this hotel for family coming over it s a few stops to the west end and 1 stop on the tube to westfield shopping centre,1
 noisy room from kitchen extractor outside good for early morning alarm call ,0
 the cooked breakfast took 45 minutes and still didn t arrive so i had to leave for work with a slice of dry dead toast and some plastic wrapped cheese the staff in the tiny kitchen doesn t speak english the tiny dining room catered for about twenty people at the same time the room was in the cellar supposedly for three persons with just a skylight and airless the reception is only manned part of the time and you never see a manager this hotel is overpriced and i felt seriously ripped off i will not use this hotel again ,0
 this was our second visit and all was good,1
 the bed was very comfy ,1
 very helpful staff early check in quiet room quiet air con,1
 our view was the back yards of a row of house on the back side of the hotel we got the furthest room from the elevators and no help was available to take our luggage close to a variety of restaurants a block away easy walk to them just past the major royal mail building ,1
 cozy and luxury hotel smily staff that makes your mud for whole day super breakfast beautiful clean rooms attention for details ,1
 i had booked a 26sqm room through you but it was a small but lovely room i got but on your confirmation you don t put room size also i love a bath and only 3 rooms have baths so didn t get one but bathroom and products fabulous these did not detract from my stay ,0
 good staff comfortable stay not too big hotel,1
 the staff were rude and very arrogant and didn t have much customer service skills,0
 it its a classic old hotel each room has a cell phone to use for calling abroad or using google maps among other things the theater bar was a good meeting place for after seeing a play,1
 hotel is not clean room was very hot ,0
 when i got to the hotel i was told that i can have my room from 2pm at 2pm it was nowhere close to ready to occupy they kept me waiting for a long time 1 5 hours and didn t let me know when i can have my room i had to check it for myself the room was very smelly first i thought i would simply leave the hotel but then i opened all windows and got rid of most of the smell the room became cold and though i turned the heating to maximum it didn t help much old ugly smelly furniture staff forgot to give me 2nd password for wi fi 2 device with me needing internet access had to go back down to reception and ask for one in the morning the cleaning lady entered the room though there was the sign do not disturb would never go back ,0
 very pleasant staff and good location ,1

 the situation and building good service and breakfast,1
 pet friendly,1
 staff were friendly and everything was clean,1
 the hotel seems to be better in picture in reality the room was too claustrophobic there was no staff to help us with the luggage we had to drag the heavy luggage ourselves reception was a podium with a single person with laptop attending the guests me n my daughter felt disgusting with the hospitality after such a long journey from india we recommend to go with branded hotel chains ,0
 the small single room was tiny and i am sure it does not meet hotel standards the hotel should not be selling this room ,0
 the view the room and the very comfortable bed the easy accessibility to the o2 and the staff in general and very friendly bar girl in the clipper bar ,1
 watch out for the comically small rickety old lift at this hotel got stuck in it when it broke down between floors no apology from staff came back to my room after a few hours to find the combination on the lock of my suitcase had been tried which was very unnerving rooms were poky and extremely hot even in december ,0
 unfriendly staff member and indifference in assisting us would not recommend ,0
 the warm friendly welcome and decor,1
 location,0
 room s size and facilities,0
 hotel toilets dirty and a v big hole in the roof food was good but no care over cleanliness or presentation bar staff automatically took an optional service charge on an already ridiculously expensive drink only noticed when checked the receipt a home certainly not value for money ,0
 great location modern looking hotel staff was very nice marianna remember who i was the next day when my key card didn t work ,1
 noisy tired bedroom and not particularly clean the receptionist on checking in was unhelpful and didn t appear to know what she was doing this was at around 3pm on friday 11th sept credit card appeared to have been charged three times which i have also had to deal with ,0
 location,1
 the whole experience no heating avaliable hot water was slow waited 9 minutes for the water before running a bath bathroom freezing due to no air con heating just basically sub standard and not what is expected for the cost ,0
 lovely hotel helpful staff and excellent location ,1
 the receptionist in the sister hotel was very emberast but very nice to us and gave us a complimentary taxi to oxford street who sadly got lost as my partner was very distressed by the whole expireance ,0
 the room was smaller than expected but furnished in a way that made it very comfortable and usable i also liked the electricity saving device that turns off all the lights once you leave the room ,1
 the staff really looked after us and especially made a fuss of our mum who s 80th birthday celebration was the reason for our visit thank you,1
 room as advertised excellent location a 2 minute walk to buses and the tube friendly and helpful front desk staff would love to stay here on our next london trip too ,1

 excellent central position,1
 location easy access to public transport situated in quiet enclave great choice breakfast professional welcoming polite staff,1
 great size room great location for us lovely public bar restaurant and modern feel to the whole building ,1
 room service,0
 staff was very professional one staff picked up trash from my hands inside the elevator i was impressed ,1
 the carpets in our room were in need of a good clean the carpets and floorboards throughout the second floor should be replaced due to the uneven and creaking sounds when walking to the lift the walls needed redecorating the hotel was advertised as a 4 it is definitely not i would not give it a 2 we were also asked to pay a 50 deposit for the mini bar which did not have any alcohol in at all ,0
 booking com has wrong room advertised for penthouse suite actual room very disappointing who is to blame here staff at reception not helpful about mix up house keeping is very average and be prepared for very long wait for breakfast in the mornings hotel is more concerned about money than the customer 1st photo is what you are shown of room at time of booking next photos actual room after spending over 800 pounds for 2 nights not happy hotel says there is nothing they can do about what images are shown of rooms yet all there images are copyrighted as per there website has been happening a long time but i believe they are happy for it to keep happening as when you have booked and arrived it s too late money is paid what you going to do attitude ,0
 everything the attitude of the staff the helpfulness of everyone particularly gary the concierge ,1
 the staff was not helpful at all the telephone was not working in the room the heating was not working properly the room was not cleaned properly ,0
 the hotel was very noisy i could not sleep i could even hear the guests walking showering and the flushing of the toilet above i was moved to three different rooms but had the same problem the hotel is very small and noisy i initially booked an executive room on arrival i paid extra to have a suite for my three night stay i was disappointed with the poor level of service and we did not even receive an apology for our sleepless nights ,0
 receptionist services friendly without asking the personel aknowleged my husbands birthday there was waiting a bottle of prosecco and a piece of cake and a card very nice gesture interior of the hotel is very esthetical and beautiful braekfast is not cheap but it is worth for the money the service at the lobby bar at the breakfast concierge services very friendly and helpful we visited london mid november ,1
 the hotel is now very worn and old not in a good way i used to stay here a few years ago and quite liked it but problems with bookings meant i switched to other properties when in london the place feels disorganised my booking had been mixed up and i couldn t get the room i had booked i was given another room which already had other peoples luggage in it staff did not seem to understand why such things are annoying when i eventually spoke to the manager he was very good and promised to rectify things for future trips but there was no practical solution offered i did get the suite i had booked on a my second night but my 2nd evening was busy with work and i only got to use it for 6 hours before checking out for the airport all in all very disappointing ,0
 the rooms were dirty and cold ,0
 booked double room got twin staff refused to change despite being platinum spg member room window looked onto restaurant not outside ,0
 beautiful view of the city including side view of the eiffel tower easy access to everything including public transportation and restaurants nice soft and clean sheets along with soft pillows clean comfortable bathroom well equipped with toiletries ,1
 small stuffed room rude annoying unprofessional staff especially the lady in charge she was too loud complaining bullying her staff ,0
 the room was dated carpet dirty scruffy wallpaper shabby furniture broken kettle lid only 4 milk portion 1 packet of biscuit tap in bathroom sink had a broken seal not worthy of a four star very upset suppose to have been a delux room we complained about the first room we were shown and this one was the better of the two also tv reception awful curtains were of the bracket so didn t meet in the middle when shut ,0
 the hotel is in an excellent location the reception staff were very efficient and the hotel had a certain amount of old world glamour about it ,1
 everything will not recommened to anyone most awfull hotel in paris they were not cleaning my room for 2 days i have nevr seen hotel where rooms not cleaned for 2 days my room was already checked in and couple was living in this room then they changed but nothing else no sorry no complimantary things ,0
 really good location for hyde park great reception team helpful porters clean linen and towels water coffee and hot chocolate supplied in club room ,1
 location and style,1
 location cleanliness comfort helpful and friendly staff little extra touches ,1
 it was claimed that i brought crokcroach to the hotel and without evidence next i was asked to park out with my family within the next hour without sorting another accommodation for me i was also charged for fumigation of a croakcroach that i never saw ,0
 the hotel boasts of having ipod docking station with music being able to be played in the shower this is a complete lie as the rooms doesn t include this rather has a device which is called ihandy this is like a mobile phone which allows for free calls when i raised this issue to the receptionist they suggested that i use the tv and put a higher volume so i could hear it from the shower had a top floor room which was very humid the bathroom had a weird smell to it overpriced for the room size as well as the facilities ,0
 location bed wifi,1
 the location was good local for trains and a short walk into the city,1
 the personnel was kind of polite but no more no assistance of any sort the room did not correspond to the description on booking com and the bathroom were not really clean the room was noisy very narrow and the carpet not clean at all the towel were over used and in a poor state not to the standard of best western the breakfast was average ,0
 the rooms were falling apart the bed had bugs i was bitten on my leg the toilet seat kept falling down and smacking into my back whilst i was engaged the room was in dire need of decoration the hair dryer blew up there was a huge pool of water on the window sill the restaurant staff had no idea what gluten free meant and i am convinced that my gluten free toast was cross contaminated somewhere in the kitchen but apart from that ,0
 dirty and overpriced arrived to find a room service tray on the stairs was still there in the morning this summed up the hotel don t stay there are better places nearby for the money,0
 inside room maintenance is poor but room ambiance is good,0
 our room was dirty and messy on arrival we weren t offered another room just cleaners sent in which delayed our check in no apology also we were woken up the next morning by a cleaner entering our room just after 9am ,0

 this hotel is located on the western edge of the city in the walking distance from all the west end attractions in a quiet courtyard next to the temple inn of court the room was spacious and well equipped ,1
 a two minute walk from the queensway tube station gorgeous building particularly the bar a former theatre and the dining room breakfast was good too ,1
 as we were going to see a concert at the o2 the location was ideal staff were very helpful ,1
 bed comfy,1
 price versus comfort ,0
 double beds are very tiny and the rooms next to the lift are very noisy so we heard them all night ,0
 i left the hotel and went looking for another place to stay,0
 to obtain a quieter room i was offered s disabled room the quality of the furniture and furhishings weren t to standard holes and chipped,0
 it s not really a hotel from a family s perspective ,0
 everything in the room was comfortable and clean and the bar area was nice and relaxed after returning from the concert that evening staff friendly and polite during stay sorry there is only so much you can do in one night ,1
 start to finish everything a room where you have a metre of floor space air con units fitted but hotel policy isnt to switch them on food was aweful 2 3 of the staff there didnt care less you so that in their customer service what made it worse is i travelled with my 5 year old and even she said it was bad looks a lovely hotel from the outside but needs a complete transformation in my opinion ,0
 rather dirty the carpet didn t even seem properly vacuumed garbage close to the bin was not completely removed by housekeeping there was water leakage in bathroom when we contacted the staff about this they just provided towels to step on in retrospect most reviews seem fake ,0
 everything except close to oxford st,0
 the rooms are loverly clean comfortable etc staff are very helpfull and polite the location in london is ideal for attractions and easy access to the tube station ,1
 room spacious enough tea coffee etc staff very pleasant bed comfy,1
 breakfast very poor attendant spoke minimal english and seriously didn t know how to cook boiled eggs ,0

 the room size it was tiny the room was so small there was not even enough room for a wardrobe the sink did not drain out and the staff did not come and fix it despite ringing them 12 hours before only 1 dressing gown and 1 pair of slippers and no safe or mini bar the night doorman was rude when we returned at 00 45 hrs and took ages to get in whilst we stood in the rain ,0
 breakfast not included and location is horrible room ok,0
 the bedroom was the smallest i ever had impossible to wash myself without hurting something and impossible to use the desk since the chair can not be used if you are taller than 1m85 ,0
 location was great,1
 very good location close to city centre and thameslink railway spacious rooms nice bathroom and a lot of extra features the breakfast was also very delicious the staff is friendly and helpful ,1
 bed was like a rock hotel was a half renovation staff were rude and unhelpful and one sent a lewd text to my sister in law after delivering pillows to her is it hot in you room or is it just you location is the only thing going for this hotel but there are literally dozens of hotels in the area and for a better rate,0
 the hotel provides a free mobile phone during your stay with unlimited calls and internet use which is awesome however it was out of battery when we arrived not very convenient but the staff especially claudio was very helpful and looked in other rooms to give us another battery ,1
 location,1
 this was our second visit to the hotel and it was as good as i remembered very friendly and helpful staff wonderful food and well presented and maintained room as we had our two children this time we were on the top floor in a duplex suite and the views where excellent located two minutes walk from the bars restaurants and shops of bercy village and cour st emilion metro station it was ideal for evening meals and getting around paris quickly ,1

 hotel was run down and reception was medieval receptionist was slow and they wanted the money for the room when we arrived before we had time to see the room walls were dirty and shower was peeling away at the ceiling headboards were scratched not a wide selection of teas for tea and coffee and room was cold i don t think the room or the stay was worth 205 for one night ,0
 everything,1
 great value for money,1
 the beds are not comfortables in some rooms smells bad in some floors that they shifted us on the rooms are small and not worth the value that is paid for ,0
 very small rooms old furniture tird bed is very uncomfortable no shower hanger to curtain in bath,0
 hotel too hot no bar facilities lacking atmosphere lift too small and slow arriving at night via taxi nobody can find it as there is no clear signage lighting outside returned three nights and walked 360 degrees around the park as i was dropped off because we couldn t find it ,0

 the room was very poor and not what we expected ,0
 room facilities and car parking,1
 accommodation on 4th floor and for 3 days lift out of action dinner reservations not made fire alarm at 1 30am and staff unhelpful as to why it is on only the 4th floor list was endless will not be staying here again ,0
 the style of hotel excellent staff and great location,1

 great location just a beautiful hotel and very helpful staff,1
 extremely disappointed with our stay 1 overpriced we took an executive suite which are the best rooms but these had zero sound proofing with every noise heard from corridor other rooms street noise etc and the rooms were also uncomfortably hot this was in october 2 staff lacking customer service skills reception duty manager inability to deal with several issues during our stay the hotel is understaffed in my opinion i would not recommend this hotel to anyone this has also severely tainted my view of the best western brand ,0
 just a small window in the room no place for the luggage,0
 we booked a rather pricey double room for 2 nights we arrived at the hotel very late only to be given a room where we had open a number of fire doors walk lengthy corridors stairs up and even more stairs down imagine all this while carrying 2 suitcases each one of us the room was clearly in a different building without a lift the walls were paper thin and we could hear those next door talking not to mention shutting their door i ll never come back ,0
 beds very comfortable ,1
 the d cor of this hotel and the history of the building makes it stand out same architect as the ritz breakfast was very good and good value ,1
 staff excellent very helpful perfect location,1
 i enjoyed my stay and liked the coffee maker in the room ,1
 excellent service,1
 the staff the location and the breakfast ,1
 could not swing a cat in room 517 the bed opposite tv needed to be replaced,0
 bathroom toilet were used when checked in restaurant bad food bad services wifi more or less not available price value ,0
 free upgrade given to a junior suite on arrival junior suite had all necessary facilities and more as well as amazing view of london eye from the bedroom and living area staff could not do enough to help you breakfast was very good and catered for all tastes ,1
 the total inflexibility after some genuine error made over a date of stay resulting in being charged 2 3 more of original price a total disgrace i intend seeking legal advice ,0
 the breakfast was very good and the bathroom nicely renovated ,1
 this place was a disappointment the space is tiny and the floor was very dirty they need to deep clean the floors when my family arrived the toilet was broken throughout our stay they had people coming to fix it but it never worked even with the toilet not working they did not discount me anything the staff there told me that i will receive a receipt at 2pm the same day through my email but i have never received any receipt when i came home i checked my credit card and it turns out they charged me 4 extra transactions a few days after i have already arrived home when i contacted them regarding the receipt and the extra transactions they took more than a day to reply and told me that they discounted me for the toilet by charging me less city tax and there was no mention of extra charges this didn t make sense because they charged me for the hotel and city tax separately the city tax was paid in full so overall it ended up costing me more than what i originally booked on here i tried to contact them again because i do not understand why they are charging me even after my stay when i did not touch any of there stuff and its not even small charges they were about 300 euros for each charge are you kidding me they still haven t reply about it so i had to call my bank to deal with this matter i am very unhappy with this place and would not reccommend anyone to stay here this is definitely not a 4 star hotel please take my advice and save yourself the trouble ,0
 3 min from london eye and imax,1
 went above and beyond ,1
 the room had a terrible strong smell of detergent paint and they had no other room to offer so they transferred me to their affiliated hotel so hyde park that hotel had the worst service i have experienced in any hotel or even youth hostel and the state of the facilities made it obvious the owners do not focus on providing a good customer experience ,0
 loved the architectural decor beautiful ceilings and the history,1
 lovely decor,1
 location accessible to whole of paris and out of the busy area for calm rest staff was good and well mannered,1
 service exemplary when checking in all the deluxe rooms were taken accept on the 7th floor the 7th floor rooms are very small and ikea ish down graded to a standard room on the 4th floor which was large and comfortable like a suite compared to the other when we arrived back at the room there were petals everywhere champagne birthday cake as my wife s birthday chocolates and a letter for a free upgrade next time excellent ,1
 lovely hotel very comfortable particularly loved the approach in the evening with the lighting red carpet and lovely elephant breakfast good with plenty of choice for every taste extremely good value we thought all staff were lovely courtyard view splendid,1
 the whole experience from start to finish was excellent,1
 clean quiet and 5 minutes walk from the metro station nice staff ,1
 great location in the city large clean comfortable room free wi fi ,1
 friendly staff comfortable rooms very good bathroom great location nice vibr,1
 the elevator sucks big time after we arrived in this hotel we saw them working on it already but after few days it was terrible they should replace the elevator my sister got trapped inside and the bell was not working luckily she brought her phone with her and she called me up through facebook messenger while she was inside it it took some time for them to get her out the room was not that clean i know if the place is dusty because i keep sneezing they didn t replace the sheets everyday the water pressure was very poor one of reason i like to stay in hotel because of water volume but that s not the case here in this hotel i choose this hotel for good review and well for the price but i should have stay in some well known hotel if i can turn back the time so problems like this won t be encountered by me i have a small baby and climbing to 4th floor in the stairs was hell the reception said sorry about it but not sincerely and according to him sometimes this kind of event will happen to anyone given it s gonna be but atleast the bell still working so someone can ask for help and seems like if someone will die inside they won t take accounts with it upon arrival we were so tired to eat outside so i decided to order a pizza and they served us a pizza where it was still cold in the center we put a note and they gave me a note as well apologizing for it and box of chocolate that was sweet of them but they should be more professional enough to sell their services and products so the money paid in exchange will be well compensated if this will be the life in london oh well i won t dare to go back and if i do i will book in some reputable hotel where the percentage of this events will be so unlikely to happen ,0
 wonderful staffs beautiful breakfast room and foods elegantly displayed and served gracious hospitality overall convenient location for public transportation ,1
 i did like how pleasant and helpful the staff where right from booking in to booking out they tried hard to overcome my problems as much as they could,1
 everything else,0
 room had no windows i asked for a little something like a card or flowers for my wife as it was her birthday got nothing all the sounds from other rooms came in neighbours were banging and slaming doors early hours of the morning kept hearing other people flush toilets cupboard was broken lights above bed didnt work ,0
 when i arrived the room was not cleaned towels were on the ground in the bathroom used glass and soap were on the table ,0
 amazing location ,1
 check in stuff rude ,0
 grubby tired bathroom poor sound insulation from traffic,0
 they hosted a rave in the sports bar on our second night starting from 10pm till early morning keeping us both awake on level five not just us kept awake but many guests complaining and staff unable to get the party of 30 people at this rave to turn the music down and no ability to get it closed down this was that loud on level five vibrations could be felt and base music heard and the dj shouting through his microphone paying to be kept awake is a novelty not likely to catch on we are awaiting a refund for that night still also the spa needs tlc and not very clean and a good idea to clean bath mats in the rooms occasionally ,0
 no guide for the numbers of the reception housekeeping or room service no laundry bags only 1 small bottle of water although i was in a double room on your arrival day they don t refill the water during your stay they don t refill the tea or nescafe no instructions for how to program the code of the safe being a tourist i asked for an electrical adapter as my cables didn t fit in the socket for 2 days i was being given the same answer all our adapters are taken by other guests you have to wait till a one is returned till i had to buy one myself completely unacceptable behavior from the hotel very uncaring attitude from the reception staff the breakfast buffet is very poor the scrambled eggs are little sauce not well cooked with no option to ask for an omelette the boiled eggs as well are not well boiled me my family almost found nothing to eat that on the second day we went to have breakfast out of the hotel although the breakfast was included in our rate on our arrival day was given a room in the 7th floor the room s air condition wasn t working properly as the room was too hot i had to go down to the reception since no guide in the room for their number to inform them about the problem they told me that someone will come to check 15 minutes later no one showed so i went down to the reception again they told me someone will come in 5 minutes finally someone came just to convince me that the air condition is working properly the funny part that while doing so i showed him that the 3 speeds of the fan are all the same none is stronger than the other he said this is normal too ,0
 great food in restaurant,1
 from the check in to departure our experience was lovely we were there for tennis so excellent location the staff in every department we met the restaurant staff were very welcoming food was delicious staff very attentive to gluten free needs room was a delight no complaints at all hope to return thank you ,1

 really bad condition on the inside of the hotel and we were sent to the basement to stay which were very dissapointing that we would not settle for so we told the staff who said all were booked and then the phone rang and he offered a room availeble for that costumer and also moved us up on the 6th floor instead the carpets are finished and in the room it could not be more stained and the cover on the chair looked like a chair in a garage who fix cars i could not touch the floor with my bare feet and der were no slippers the towels smelled like they were hang to dry nextside the kitchen it is way to expensive with that standard we will never come back,0

 staff cooperation clean room perfect location,1
 people coming into your room without knocking loud banging doors breakfast buffet was poor over cooked and luke warm room was more like a cell ,0
 unfortunately when we arrived our room was not ready as we arrived early morning but they notified us that the room would be available at 1pm we went out and came back at 1pm the room was not ready they still had to take measurements of the room and said it would take another 20 minutes 45 minutes later we were allowed to enter the room there was quite a lot of noise within the hotel because the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbour s conversation no new sheets were given everyday they would just re make the bed even though the sheets were dirty we also put up a do not disturb sign once but they still entered the room the staff were polite but not very enthusiastic and engaging overall i wouldn t return back to this hotel ,0

 rooms were very nice design ,1
 no working plug in bath room was very tatty ,0

 pretty much everything the bed was the worst it was a queen size bed for me and my partner but we felt like the edges made us roll off so we both tried squashing in the middle of the bed the service desk never picked up our calls there was no toothbrush or paste the room stunk every time we walked in probably rather stay in a motel next time ,0

 we went away for my partners birthday and we were very disappointed to discover that the spa facilities and the roof top bar were not in use even though it was advertised on the website which is why we chose this hotel there was also a fire alarm that went off at 3am disturbing our sleep aswell as a power cut while we were in the room considering the hotel was brand new the room was very dusty on the dressing table and tv overall we were very disappointed with this hotel with the money that we spent to go here ,0

 room view and comfy beds,1
 there where no wifi the phone ringing every night at 3 and 5 am the room window was opened directly to the public street so no privacy and the staff was not educated,0

 the staff especially bernard at the concierge the hotel is old and gorgeous ,1
 the location is perfect food is good cleanness,1
 the room was stuffy and smelt stale not what you expect when your paying the cost you are also the room i booked was a deluxe queen room which was not deluxe by any means the bed was a standard double bed the bathroom was tiny there was nothing about the hotel that stood apart from a cheaper priced one the price you pay is for the name of the hotel it s most certainly is not reflected in what you get i will not stay there again also the photos advertised with the hotel are very missleading,0

 very friendly clean and comfortable bed,1
 friendly and helpful staff close to tube and paddington main line 5 mins walk hyde park 5 mins walk very comfortable bed in quiet area yet bars and restaurants nearby ,1
 hotel is next to a pub can get very noisy and the smell of alcohol next morning is evident when walking to breakfast room water pressure from taps was variable had to wait around 10 minutes for water pressure to rise sometimes pressure dropped during a shower if you are not a fan of a traditional breakfast then continental options and quality is limited ,0
 great location walked in hyde park every evening after dining at numerous restaurants nearby all varieties of food indian chinese italian malaysian starbucks too ,1
 the receptionist lady charged me twice with my credit card and one is still on provision i am trying to contact with them and gave them to cancel it with the relevant provision number but they are as lazy as elephant they don t even bother to respond my e mails they are unskillful about even the swaping card act like i will get loose before paying thus forced me for that in addition to that they didn t have any adapter for european plug to the uk they say every room has it one but some might stole the one should be in my room didn t find any for me the worst hotel experience i had in the uk ever they are thief ,0
 the bathroom smelt due to the shower which smelled like an open drain when reported to reception they weren t interested ,0
 unhelpful staff and rude cleaners slamming doors and shouting down the hall at 8am,0
 everything wonderful from the moment we arrived staff couldn t do enough and very friendly room excellent home from home furnishings comfy bed relaxed atmosphere food great brilliant access into 02 arena parking a bonus ,1
 decor and furnishing staff friendliness and helpfulness location,1
 the room was very small and adequate at best the net curtains were filthy the bathroom toiletries were screwed to the wall no soap shower cap etc all very basic ,0
 broken window frame meant it would not close fully meaning no protection from the noisy main road most of the night and early morning were not informed a ticket was needed to exit car park on our departure meant we held several people up really poor standard of coffee at breakfast and a disappointing full english was served ,0
 building works left the hall to our room dirty decor to room could do with a refresh bed hard only 1 pillow water splashed out of bowl when flushed only two teabags ,0
 i didn t have it,1
 we stayed two nights and on the sunday night there was lots of banging and noise coming from the loading bay at the front of the building we could not close the doors as the air conditioning made a screaming noise business centre had no toner in printer and only one computer worked room was not cleaned when we arrived back after 6pm in evening manager was rude and insulting when issues were raised ,0
 the staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least i was finally shifted to a bigger room but when i requested for check out till 3 pm on friday the lady told me that till 2 it was okay and she will try for 3 then she says that she will do it only till 1 and not till 3 no reason was given for this at all ,0

 excellent hotel with impeccable service,1
 very comfortable and wide single beds comfortable bar good breakfast,1
 we got moved to a different room at the last minute room 636 when we checked in earlier and when we picked up the key later was moved to 730 without explanation the air conditioning didn t work and what should have been a superior room looked out over the back we only had one pillow each too it was our first wedding anniversary i spoke to the duty manager about the air conditioning explaining we weren t satisfied her reply was ask if we wanted to check out it was 2130 at this point no apology nothing not great management skills witnessed ,0
 i booked a double room for five days but i received a single room so small that we couldn t move in side the room the air conditioned does not work in almost all rooms i spent three days stewing me in a micro oven warm room after i have complained a lot they change us for four times until find a working aircon after complain a lot about the size when they put us in a very much smal room just could accommodate one person they show us a room bigger promised a room like that but put us in another very smal room nevertheless many employes are from abroad i realized this hotel does not like very much foreign people if you are not a blond blue eye england person they will put you in a very smal micro oven warm wormy room the breakfast is worm with rotten fruits the service room bring us the worst meal that i ever have seen in all my life the pizza is fast food meal bought on the market of the corner the hand mad meat and rice from the menu is an absolut lie is ready food bought on the corner as well the elevator is broken for a long time ago for many months so guests have to use a very bad smelling fire stairs the hotel does not intend to fix the elevator it s hall is now just a dirty and messy deposit finally internet wifi is terrible does not work most part of time to be in this hotel is waste of money don t you believe in it try on it and after that put your opinion here i m gonna waiting ,0
 i do really love the balcony we spent many days here and every morning when i wake up the balcony made me a very happy morning the location is also great for women there are many nice food restaurants and nice shops you do not need to worry that nothing to do in the evening because near the hotel there are also many nice bar with good view just 5 minutes walk to luxembourg park is also great ,1
 worst hotel experience in paris the hotel was dirty there was no electricity on the day of arrival i could not check in until 4pm after an 11h flight staff was rude and unhelpful ,0

 there was a rat at the restaurant i was eating,0
 the rooms are clean and quiet,1
 very very small room without window room 007 i think you should tell that prior to booking no way to fully open the luggage in the room air con did not work just a fan old too soft bed literally impossible to turn around in the bath room especially in the shower nice location but impossible to pick a taxi from the street,0
 brilliant hotel fantastic amenities comfy bed and great shower staff were polite and friendly and had perfect access to o2,1
 it needs better maintenance,0
 small rooms poor isolation and terrible old shower spilling all over the bathroom and not on me ,0
 loved the character and history of the place and the location loads of great pubs and restaurants mostly italian nearby friendly efficient and polite staff ,1
 i didn t like that the hotel had a failure of their hvac during a record heat wave i didn t like that their only option for relief was one of five fans available for the entire hotel obviously i wasn t one of the lucky or quick ones and had to endure a room that was 84 degrees that may have been ok if i could open my window to let air in i did and until nearly 4 in the morning got to listen to the dance clubs and drunks from the massive station across the street one of my colleagues while enduring the opressive heat also woke up to ants crawling on him in his bed the hotel management refused to speak to our group and the rest of the staff was terribly rude i also didn t like the fact that staff kept telling us the air was fixed when 84 degrees on the top floor of the hotel clearly proved it wasn t lastly having to change hotels in the middle of my trip doesn t rank at the top of things i like about this terrible hotel my advice if you re looking for a place to stay where staff treats you as a guest and not as if they re extending you a great privilege by letting you have a room go elsewhere ,0
 worst experience i ever had in a hotel cancelled my booking without informing me and doubled the rate when i returned to sleep at night,0
 so so so bad experience and memories when i was in the hotel the first night when i arrive in the hotel after a long long journey so so tired but when i want to take a shower before sleep the water was totally cold cold totally cold no hot water then i call the reception knowing that the system of the whole hotel was wrong ok i can understand the system broken but why do not inform the clients early the hotel know it before but did not tell the client i have no choose and then very sad and tired without a shower and then i pay cash to the opposite another hotel to rent a room for shower in the first night i arrive in paris alone and midnight and what is more terrible is the second day morning when i told the new reception what happened last night the reception named jimmy with very bad attitude told me ok we have problem with the system but we have already make it well now you have already the hot water and i said so how about last night you even did not say sorry and i even pay cash to another hotel for a shower in the midnight and jimmy said so ok what do you want last night is past and past is past you need to pay so show me the prove oh my god i even do not believe my ear i stand there do not believe what he said i never let the hotel to pay the fees for shower but my god they even did not say sorry in the second day so rude and make me really angry i travelled all over the world and it was my sixth time in paris but the first time to meet so ugly hart and bad rude guy even the reception of the first night boy was so sorry and said so shamed for no hot water with many polite but the old reception jimmy are so so so bad polite ,0
 room was spotless the bed was very comfortable duvet was very lightweight but extremely warm unlike some hotels you couldn t hear any sound from neighbouring rooms,1
 room looked very different to the pictures when i booked the room paid extra only to be put in what looked like a standard room staff was rude when i asked to check in at 1 but check in time was 2 o clock then in the next morning they was mocking on my room at 9 50 to clean the room,0
 no slipper in the room room is quite small the location is not as good as expected ,0
 incredibly friendly helpful staff modern clean room very good value ,1
 1 nobody meet we had to park the car in the basement and take the luggage ourselves just one old man was slowly working 2 they give a room on a 2nd floor where eiffel tower top was visible but they was claiming that the room is with the eiffel view then he changed the room to the 6 floor where somehow we could partially see eiffel tower but from the 4 floor we had to take the luggage to the 6 floor through very narrow stairs there was no lift going to this floor 3 there wasn t minibar and even a fridge 4 there wasn t any phone directory to call the concierge or a reception if there s concierge at all 5 no room service 6 they have charged me 2 parking days each day 25 euros for just 24 hours 7 definitely not a 4 star hotel complete cheating ,0
 reception staff were very friendly and helpful i left my purse in a restaurant and they were very sympathetic looked up the local police station and i actually got it back aurelia checked us in and saw us later but not sure who the other member of the team was called both lovely though ,1
 size of room and bathroom staff porters excellent kettle ,1
 fairly quiet pleasant and spacious rooms at reasonable price comfy bed meals very good ,1
 this hotel is a hole in the wall what is there to like in it ,0
 location location location and breakfast ,1
 the single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com it was really claustrophobic and tiny i could not upgrade and there was no fridge the worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when i went to the front office to ask if i should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if i booked online he would honour it but he would rush before me to close the bookings worse hotel experience ever,0
 we were in room 816 which was in the basement so not much of a view also the room we had was far too small for twin beds no room for cases and so the bathroom door only half opened against one of the beds so you had to sidestep into it lucky we are both fairly slim ,0
 our delux room was fabulous spacious that special boutique feeling ,1
 found dust on the sheets the chair was full of dust very very small room tacky hotel tube station close to the hotel will be closed until 2018,0
 staff were very friendly and helpful,1
 good staff comfortable bed good breakfasts the sixth time i m back but don t want to be in the basement again ,1
 the wifi did not connect well at all the floor in the room was wet and the shower along with the toilet was not clean,0
 friendly staff and modern facilities,1
 de liked the fact that we could do early check in the beds were comfortable it s good to have a mini fridge in the room too the spa was great and good price 3 50 the massages were too expensive though the rooms had good isolation and the cleaning personnel was very discreet when doing the rooms on our floor also very thick curtains allowing you to sleep in it s close to a nice neighbourhood exmouth market where you can find a nice cafe called briki ,1
 so clean helpful and so friendly staff spacious rooms very good smell at lifts and corridors nearby metro station and good restaurants,1
 very nice room staff very friendly great location ,1
 staff not good,0
 this hotel looks the part from outside just don t go in the room is more like you would expect in claxton no offence to clacton the first room you could not swing the proverbial cat we moved to a bigger room and that smelt of stale cigarette smoke the 3rd and final room we looked at still shabby but stayed 1 night instead of 2 do not boot this hotel try the ymca ,0
 the breakfast was excellent ,1
 i booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night the booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed when i arrived they insisted i pay for the canceled booking i should have just walked away but thought i could resolve it they were rude and steadfast in insisting i pay for the canceled night i contacted booking com to help resolve the situation booking com were very helpful recognized i had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue the hotel blankly refused not very nice people at all i would never stay again ,0
 friendly and helpful staff nice breakfast well connected location balcony onto nice park ,1
 rooms were very small no lift cracks in walls general state of dilapidation ,0
 bad smell in entire hotel staff was not so helpful,0
 great value,1
 great location for the theatres around covent garden,1
 location,1
 very understaffed and the pool was filthy and an added charge ,0
 lovely comfy bed great location close to tube and the walkway to the o2 was great staff all very friendly room very clean and quiet ,1
 location friendly staff next to hyde park supermarkets and restaurants metro is about 100 meters away ,1
 early check in time and reception staff,1
 i couldn t check in at the mentioned time had to wait for additional two hours for the room to get ready the room was on the 9th floor and was too noisy because of the undergoing works the shower water temperature was not hot enough i left my room at 9 00 came back at 15 00 room service was not done annoying sounds going on and off in the middle of the night from the heater 2 stars are more than enough for this hotel ,0
 the friendliness of the staff was lovely and so helpful the hotel was always clean tidy comfortable ,1
 fantastic location and excellent staff ,1
 birthday tray was organized wasn t ready and i had to call from the room to ask where it arrived 4hours late the restaurant was booked for outside to enjoy the views couldn t have the table booked as the hotel had booked a private function if i had know i would have gone somewhere else no water available paid for breakfast for my wife and they were supposed to pass the ticket under the door this never happened so my wife never got breakfast which was paid for spent 15minutes calling reception until someone answered to complain that we could not sleep as the music from the function was vibrating through the room ,0
 beds are like 80 cm width too small regarding the size of the room ,0
 staff were polite and helpful,1
 good bed for a london hotel ,1
 breakfast was amazing great choice and really fresh,1
 room very small bathroom suitable for a caravan site sink so small you can hardly wash your teeth in drain was clogged with filth and i had to clean it breakfast out of a carton box all in all disaster from start to finish best to re name hotel into a guest house only paying such room rates for location only nothing else ,0
 they did not book correct and desired room and expected us to pay for it anyways we were promised the room we intended the following day but that was a false promise ,0
 staff not a good welcoming and when complained staff did not seemed bothered when booking i asked for an upper storey room i get there and they gave me a level 2 out of 13 room my view was some flats considering when paying 144 per night without breakfast and not even get asked how was your stay ,0
 terrible first of all they asked 300eu deposit for the mini bar and the room didn t even had a mini bar it wasn t even written on the policies of the hotel or the booking for two days we had no soap in the room they totally forgot to put any the room had no view at all all i saw was pipes the wifi was weak everywhere and after all it needs improvement in all departments ,0
 there are squeaking sounds from the floor when you step on it in the room and you can her it from the other rooms and it s very disturbing the room i paid for was an executive one but i found out it was very small and it was not as shown on the booking web site the hall was small an narrow the hotel had only one lift and it was small and narrow as well the furniture was old and not in a classic way it is a motel not a hotel i can t believe someone gave it a 4 star hotel i don t recommend this hotel to my enemies ,0
 everything just not what i expected for a so called 4 star hotel it is in need of a complete overhaul from the threadborn carpets to the decor to the furniture to the cleanliness of the bathroom never again just a very poor hotel ,0
 the bed was really comfortable and the hotel was in a great location we enjoyed our 1 night stay ,1
 the bedrooms were very outdated and spooky the cleanliness was poor had to pay 5 for an ice bucket and glasses to be brought to the room we thought we would upgrade our room and to be honest the amount we paid for we were better off at the hilton 20 mins only of free wifi in room ,0
 poor room facilities says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it rooms are tiny for a 4 star to not have any room service is poor has a fridge which was empty no guest service book had to guess how to even call reception i travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again ,0
 not worth the money such a shame as it was our first weekend in london as a family would like a refund,0
 only 10ish mins walk from olympia and hammersmith station room was large clean and surprisingly quiet luggage storage very useful good value for money in central london given the room size and location ,1
 the bed the poor quality of fixtures and the lack of apparent knowledge of these things by the staff,0
 the room and hotel was amazing was lovely,1
 location ,1
 this is definitely not a four star hotel according to european standard ,0
 the room was 250 for an executive suite and it was smaller than your advertised standard room terrible room for the cost 18 for a single gin and tonic ,0
 staff were exceptionally helpful friendly and breakfast was very nice and well managed ,1
 not in shoreditch in hackney which is a considerable distance away ,0
 no lobby where one could sit and wait since early check in after long overnight flight was not available terrible room no shower enclosure everything soaked if one took a shower no surround to washbasin so nowhere to put,0
 tv didn t work room and decor tired shower head lower than head height hotel charged credit card an extra 30 00in case i had any room service i was not asked if this was ok nor did i give permission for them to do so and to insult me further they haven t even refunded me the money since checking out 24 hours later how can you take people s money without asking ,0
 the hotel is small noisy and out dated ,0
 modern clean professional staff great breakfast ,1
 location,1
 bit better signage so one can find the hotel google maps or apple maps cannot locate the hotel ,0
 the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the products in the mini bar,1

 the old colonial style decoure is lovely and the lounge and bar areas is a lovely place to have a drink staff were happy to sever drinks when o got back late even though the bar was shut ,1
 the room was very comfortable and well appointed ,1
 every part of this stay was horrendous from start to finish when we arrived the sockets did not work so could not charge our phones before heading out for dinner the room was dirty i woke up in the morning to the bathroom flooded water had come all the way out to the room wetting bags shoes toiletry bags etc could not get reception on phone for ages nobody came to clean the mess could not get hold of a gm breakfast was awful dry toast was all we could stomach eating as place was so dirty needless to say we are in process of looking for a full refund from the hotel ,0
 jerry built interior facilities rotten district location,0

 location and age of hotel,1
 the size of the room spoilt the trip it was advertised as a 4 star and to me the hotel was a one star tiny grim rooms ,0
 refurbished room all spotless comfortable and modern gorgeous bathroom fabulous breakfast excellent value for money ,1
 extra comfy beds and levels of service and great location,1
 we were allowed to check in an hour early with no fuss we just used the hotel as a base for somewhere to read charge on the evening the stay was pleasant and would not think twice about returning ,1
 all the staff were very lovely and helpful and polite this place is a historic gem ,1
 location was perfect ,1
 bathroom was dirty upon arrival front desk staff was nice but the staff at the hotel bar was very rude ,0
 good location and the staff are very friendly and helpful when needed definitely recommended to all travellers,1
 had a lovely stay for a night to catch a show and shop we checked in to a beautiful room overlooking the park the room was spotless and we had lots space the location is fantastic great value for money ,1
 as we told you we were unable for health reasons to take up our booking ,0
 the building is beautiful old style with lots of carved wood and leaded glass natural light in the bathroom which was modern and super clean no dinner available in the restaurant but there are loads of places for dinner and breakfast also if you want just a minute s walk away the hotel is on a really quiet street with a busy one around the corner not just one but two tube stations a minute or two away ,1
 amazing bar in the old theatre and woodwork,1
 staff are so helpful and the hotel is outstanding absolutely amazing hotel to stay at the view from the hotel room was so amazing and it was very easy to access public transport from the hotel location ,1
 room tiny no cooked breakfast,0

 as above,0
 the staff were really attentive to their guests ,1
 the hotell is the worst 4 stared hotell i have visit you musn t belive it s rated as 4 star the brekfast is very expensive simple and not tasty at all please don t buy it the walls between the rooms are very thin so you here a lot from the other guests ,0

 service breakfast order was not collected off door i was late for meeting ,0
 the rooms were spacious and very comfortable,1
 the locoation was great i used to pass the building when i was studying here i felt really comfortable with a familiar environment ,1
 staffs are ungraciously,0
 could not book bus pass or theatre as concierge not available staff not understanding english not enough beverages in room had to keep asking reception milk in room out of date bathroom complimantrys had been used again informed reception,0
 staff friendly and good location next to waterloo station ,1
 breakfast was rubbish with the restaurant more like a canteen in butlins ,0
 dirty unfriendly staff very poor shame that it in a very nice location but very rotten inside,0
 dirty shower and the sink disgusting something you would not expect for 239 ,0
 for 400 pounds a night and breakfast not included i was shocked and that is being polite,0
 nothing,0
 everything but the most shocking was the room i paid 150 for a room that didn t had nothing to do with what showed in the pic disappointed ,0
 the room was tiny i ve seen bigger broom cupboards the shape of the room was laughable bed was cut into a wall so that once you climbed it you had walls on both sides i ve no idea how a cleaner would get in there as i calculated the floor area as about 1 5m sq even getting undressed you were banging up against walls and then there was nowhere to put anything wifi was non existent ,0
 the area is within a night club district during the early hours there are a lot if noise disturbances which resonate all the way to the hotel ,0
 bar prices ridiculous room heating stuck on and staff all foreign and can t understand you worst hotel in london i ve stayed at,0
 location fresh flowers in the loby ,1
 we did not like the way we had to enter our room through different doors and stairs as the hotel was actually two different buildings at one breakfast was toooooo poor and really was no value for money most of the times we preferred not to eat our breakfast at the hotel also they had a different option for english breakfast with charge consider that the first day we asked from the waitress for boiled eggs and she told us that the cost for 2 eggs would have been 3 5 while afterwards we saw that the cost per egg was 1 5 we have paid for an executive room and we had the boiler for hot water inside the room and it made noise during night even though we had the boiler inside our room we had problem with hot water in the douche as not all the times we had hot water we could not open any windows to take some fresh air when we needed we had to get out of the hotel we had to close the door with the key even when we were inside as it was half broken and if we did not lock with a key the door would open on its own the floor made noise in every step ,0
 strange staff jizz on the curtains,0
 inattentive staff poor location,0
 the room was dated horrible and i left the hotel,0
 room was small windows were blacked out as it faced into ducts which were covered in bird faeces the bathroom shower rail was hanging off and tile was broken bath panel was warped and hanging off tv didn t work corridors tired and dated most worrying of all was that the smoke detector in the room had been covered over by plastic perhaps shower cap and no one had noticed all above was reported to front desk staff ,0
 pleasant staff easy to check in room was nice and clean plenty to choose from for breakfast and good opening times for breakfast close to the tube station given a choice of which floor we like to stay on ,1
 lovely quaint old hotel beautiful leaded windows we had a 6th floor double deluxe room rooms are small but well equipped and clean just around the corner from a busy high streer and tube on the central line would definitely go back,1
 very small rooms no logistics very poor lobby ,0
 room cleaning is very very very bad,0
 bathroom was dirty and mouldy beds were lumpy towels not provided properly coffee shop not open in morning no outside phone line limited and slow wifi no porter facility staff didn t smile poor sound proofing and no mini bar and more ,0
 great location being about 150yds from queensway tube with easy access to central london great character with lots of history especially the theatre bar helpful and friendly staff ,1
 superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her teddybears 3 clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table the underground is only a 2 minute walk so getting around was very easy i am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it ,1
 the best scrambled eggs i ve ever had in a hotel super comfy beds spacious public rooms ,1
 several staff members were unhelpful and slow at responding bathroom shower was full of hair and other waste ,0
 the hotel is not same as the pictures and reviews in booking com the facilities are not for 4 star hotel the bath room is so small and we were not comfortable for taking shower we ve reserved 1 room with king size bed but the bed was twins and we were not comfortable during our stay time i ve already asked to reception in my check in time but unfurtunatly nothing happened the staff are not so prefosional and they were not in kind mood especially waiteres in resturant ,0
 the food was good and the servers were helpful,1
 the quality of the room and the view,1
 just around the corner from the hammersmith apollo which was ideal as we were going to an event there and having a secure underground car park was a plus good and varied choice for breakfast ,1
 great breakfast,1
 dirty room bathroom stuck every time one tried to close it showerhead was loose so that water just ran down the wall rather than through the shower very tired decor it feels like a hotel that has been flogged to exhaustion ,0
 we don t recommend this hotel to no one traveling from usa,0
 the rooms aircon was not working had to open a window and there was so much noise a very uncomfortable experience and no sleep,0
 excellent staff great meals didn t feel enormous ,1
 very convenient and cosy hotel close to some of the nicest places of paris the view from the room is amazing from eiffel tower to montmartre and notre dame the staff is helpful to have a nice stay in paris ,1
 super small room with old facilities 200 pounds more which is not valuble at all,0
 location perfect and delightful area not too busy lovely park opposite nice restaurants and bars in the area character of hotel is beautiful with lovely marble and tiled features staff polite and helpful our room was large with nice bathroom would definitely stay there again ,1
 false advertising the room we placed in was completely different to what we had viewed online the room wasn t clean the sides hadn t been dusted for a number of weeks or more the tv signal wasn t great so weren t able to watch with a good picture or without interference we had informed staff to see if it could be resolved but was told it couldn t be helped due to the wind ,0
 our room was freezing when i reported this it was ignored eventually after several attempts to get something done a manager called mohamed came to the room and was unhelpful and offensive ultimately i had to go down to reception and threaten to cause a scene if we were not moved appalling attitude to a guest problem,0
 it was the ideal location for sightseeing and showing our amercian friends london all the staff were very friendly we told them it was our friends anniversary they put a bottle of wine in there room plus a lovely card ,1
 weird approach and entrance old hotel cheap quality furnishings,0
 staff excellent helpful and friendly room service excellent breakfast excellent,1
 room phone was not operating for outside calls isolation was not convenient and the room was very cold complimentary bottle of water was previously opened,0
 loved the afternoon tea every afternoon a staff would come bring chocolate to the room the underground was right across the street staff was nice and helpful with suggestions and i slept on a cot because there were 3 of us in a room and the cot was actually very comfy ,1
 quiet room with a very comfortable bed ,1
 extremely clean modern and updated great room set up for a family with two children the double bed is in one room and the kids have a fold out couch in the other ,1
 great location comfortable room ,1
 very close to eventim apollo and the tube station ,1
 rooms were newly renovated staff was mostly helpful ,1
 location was really nice just 10 minutes away from paddington station good restaurants and shops are near by ,1
 the room was beautiful and very clean and quiet the staff were very friendly has free wine and fruit on arrival fresh flowers every day and a free newspaper delivered we loved the compimentary slippers and dressing gown everything was so nice from the t v to the shower it was a double and very powerful plus a room safe and brilliant selection of coffee tea and biscuits free shampoo shower gel body lotion and shower cap even had an emergency pack of cotton buds and cotton wool pads and a sewing kit also a hairdryer that worked well loved every minute ,1
 very smal rooms,0
 everything staff were unhelpful i had my belongings stolen and they were unhelpful would not go back rooms are so so small and i paid for an upgrade i asked for a quiet room but got quite the opposite i would never stay here again i will stick to the grane in st pauls ,0
 hotel is in a good position although tucked away from the main road our room was very clean and the bed comfortable the iron and ironing board came in handy as we were going to a wedding,1
 i am a frequent traveller when on company work and so have high expectations when i use a hotel at this price range with my personal money and clayton failed to meet my expectations ,0
 very friendly staff specially lucia who helps us with all our req great location comfortable rooms ,1
 the room was small there was bird poo and a cigarette butt on the balcony the bathroom was tiny doesn t reflect on the pictures at all no wifi in rooms have to pay 15 a day ,0
 great location extremely helpful and polite staff who always went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our stay ,1
 alot just because it s on this very chic street famed for it s designer boutiques this hotel really does not belong there firstly i arrived and told my room ready when i opened the door to my room i was met by a sour faced looking woman who didn t even say hello just told me abruptly j arrive tout suite after i waited she left the room and looked again at me rather sour faced not a great start at all the room smelt strange it looked clean enough but i could see they are not doing such a great job of cleaning it properly my first night was that bad that i actually did not stay the second and stayed with a friend i was woken up at 3am with the people in the room above consistently moving the electrical outside shutters up and down then i could here a noise inside the cupboard where the mini bar was i lay still listening and i realised it was a mouse or something else i got up and switched on the light and called reception immediately the noise stopped as soon as i put on the light and was moving i ve had mice in a previous flat before i know that as soon as a light goes on or they hear feel movement they go very still anyway the guy came quickly and checked but he didn t check behind the minibar but assured me there was nothing there i kept the light on the rest of the night and didn t get any sleep the hotel is old and in need of some major refurbishment on my floor there was trolleys for the cleaners everywhere and bags and it was really unpleasant unlike in other hotels the cleaning ladies were just miserable and rude it just created a bad feeling coupled with a smelly room whcih potentially has vermin lingering around the price was almost 150 euros a night which was ridiculous don t anybody be fooled by the road it s on and the pictures they put as their main picture they only apply to their more expensive rooms ,0
 no water available in the rooms and the dirty coffee cups were not replaced or cleaned away ,0
 very cleanly hairdryer and iron included in the room great location near the hammersmith apollo and hammersmith tube station ,1
 lift broken so had to walk up to 3rd floor staff unhelpful could hear everything in the next room including them putting the tv on at 12am and waking up at 6 30am room tiny no water pressure from the shower could hardly get in the bathroom as the door nearly hit the sink,0
 the location is very good in near the subway the staff and breakfast are excellent,1
 both the reception and convention staff were helpful welcoming and superbly efficient requests were responded to swiftly and effectively nothing was too much trouble extremely well trained highly commendable ,1
 the hotel after my reservation with kids wanted to charge me 20 euros for the crib the family room was actually 2 rooms which wasnt clear as i showed that i have a baby 4 months old i was put on a floor that has only stairs access the elevator is small and very slow they keys system is not reliable i had to return the keys every time i leave the hotel the extra bed brought in was broken and no back charge was done after paying the full amount i was asked to pay during check out and if i didnt insist that i did i would of been charged again the cleaning materials were on every floor and they didnt have a place to store them ,0
 very tired hotel can t be more than 20 30 years old and looks like it s never had a penny spent on it i have stayed in the britannia at manchester and it has a similar tired look this hotel is the same the excuse for manchester is that the building is over 100 years old the shower in my room was pitiful ,0
 location and food poor,0
 on arrival the reception tried to move us to another hotel no rooms left despite having booked this weeks ago for location the room 308 was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in i measured it it was 2m x 2 3m at the bottom of a very steep stairs within the room the shower cubicle was 2ft x 2ft ,0
 great location very central to main london sites staff very friendly spacious room ,1
 service in the bars and restaurant were excellent,1
 the cleaning was poor,0
 very close to 02 arena after a shoe,1
 i did not get the room i booked and paid for we were in a very small room on the ground floor with a rotten place in the wood floor right in the area at the foot of the bed we were put in a room with a garden view after paying extra for a city view we were moved the next day up to the 6th floor with city view that i paid for the guy then told me i hope you are happy now there was a terrible odor coming from the bathroom so bad that we had to open the window and keep that door closed the sink was stopped up in the bathroom and the shower control fixture was broken the fixture was busted and easy to see that you could not turn on the cold side and the button was missing from the hot side i told two different employees about this and they acted like it was just fine the mini bar fridge had a small container of milk that had expired in feb and this is mid may my goodness oh yeah the hotel staff blamed the booking problems on booking com,0
 loved everything ,1
 fine bed well equipped bathroom lovely staff great service ,1
 everything about the hotel was fabulous,1
 way too expensive for what it is very poor conditions ,0
 having pre booked and paid for this hotel in advance for one of our directors i was shocked to receive a call from said director advising they were refusing him entry to his room apparently you needed photographic id and a form filled out by the card holder for a payment already made what is the point in pre paying for this to be the situation on arrival he had to stand in reception for over half an hour waiting for someone in our head office to scan paperwork over as they were in a meeting this resulted in him being late for his event in the evening the reception team were unwilling to cancel the booking and let him pay with his own credit card really unhelpful ,0
 very very noisy and very expensive,0
 super hotel extremely well situated with a very large pool,1
 location ,1
 the hotel has its own character and a long history very cool vibe we got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside ,1
 all of it ,1
 this hotel i don t think so is 4 star b b have mor facility then this hotel 85 charge you first then you go in room you see everything is from 30 years go very dirty very small room and i just started singing someone open door and say room service i was naked and i ask him what you want he say i wanna check fridge i say just go out i m arriving 20 minutes a go and i change my hotel 1 paying 85 for 1 hours ,0
 hotel does not worth the money they charge prime lift is not working,0
 the old world look of the interior and the opera bar ,1
 the staff was excellent very friendly and always going above beyond to accolades request ,1
 initial first impressions of hotel was impressive we were aware of renovations hotel room was great as well as spa facilities and reasonably priced the food served in the hotel could have been better,1
 the room was on the outside of the hotel and currently there is a considerable amount of construction taking place next door which made for an interrupted two nights sleep,0
 food options especially the breakfast the room facilities the iron in a room was very poor the shower bath very old fashion,0
 great customer service,1
 location helpful staff and services ,1
 almost every thing,0
 the bed was very comfy and the breakfast was excellent ,1
 disappointed with the service the cleanliness and the facility not a hilton property they made me pay 4 for requesting empty plate at the room bed skirt was dirty and bed sheets and house keeping were not properly done i paid someone 10 to get me an additional baggage deck who never showed up i had to pay for drinking water as there is no complementary bottles not hilton standard in the bathroom shower cap was never replaced in regards to the facility bathroom is way too small ,0
 bed comfortable only used the room no other facilities location good bus nearby straight to oxford street and elsewhere ,1
 really friendly and accomodatig bar staff ,1
 though i had paid up everything was stopped at the exit to take payment again and the staff were very rude and for the same room they deducted double payments and very unprofessional and poor service ,0
 staff hidden charges ,0
 the style and architecture of the hotel is exquisite the staff provided good attentive service and were always friendly,1
 our second stay and again a thoroughly enjoyable visit ,1
 staff extremely friendly fab location very convenient location to shops bars and restaurants extremely comfy bed in junior suite and spacious room,1
 5 star hotel this should be a bad joke when i arrived i had to ask the luggage boy to help us with out luggage and he had absolutely no reaction he was acting he he wouldn t hear me i wanted to speak to the manager about this situation and the only thing he said was that he was sorry the furniture in the our room was ruined and must have been 20 years old ,0
 the whole stay ,1
 location was great ,1
 interior design,1
 service bad room very small from bed to bathroom no floor space,0
 unorganised staff the place needs an update,0
 i was put in a smoking room as i requested and ofcourse a smokig room may sometimes slightly smell of smoke but this room was filthy it stunk and it was just a massive dissapointment from a normally amazing hotel i also had to wait at the back door for somebody to open it for 25 minutes as the front entrance was shut this wasnt late at night it was around 7 pm ,0
 top location,1

 the windows were broken it was cold in the room it took two days to get it fixed meanwhile ac was continuously blowing cold air we had to put extra layers on to survive through the night the housekeeping starts knocking on the doors at 8am and it is impossible to sleep with all the noise housekeeping bucket and vacuum cleaner is kept in the alleys like installation pieces the cozy double feels like a tiny single the space between the bed and the wall is 7 cm i wonder how the hotel got 4 stars felt like a hostel ,0
 location,1
 below average very poor service and facilities ,0
 noisy loud music all night room not clean ,0

 room size,0

 a the tv in our room broke down b reception agreed to change our room however the second room was unacceptable as the air conditioning unit was faulty and making an irritating and continuous dripping noise which prevented us from sleeping the time was now approximately 2 am in the morning and it was important for me to get some sleep c we were provided with an up grade on the 2nd floor by edgware road noisey traffic including emergency services continued through the night d the bed was very hard and creaked loudly it was too late and we were too tired to make another compliant e my wife awoke with lower back pain and i arose with pain in my right hip f we went down to have breakfast and discovered the food was hard and cold,0
 very noisy airco in my room with only 2 options on or off small room very small desk in room,0
 we were made fun of half our day was wasted when checking in previous to a telephone conversation we were invited to check in in one hour we arrived after 2 hours and were told there is construction work in the hotel and surrounding it with noise problems we were told that rooms with view towards the inside of the hotel were only available in a 4 star hotel we were told to wait until 2 it was 12ish so we went for a walk and when we came back at 2 the room was not ready at 2 20 the room was still not ready but we were offered a voucher for a drink which excluded cocktails and alcohol basically soo cheap dont give it if you dont want to offer it we threw the vouchers away after checking in the room smelled like fresh paint as the hotel was under construction and gasses were coming in from ventilation dont go there there are other options and the pictures are a misrepresentation of the hotel at its current state ,0
 all,0
 loved the old theatre now the cafe bar and the breakfast rooms,1
 reception and check in was very good bar and restaurant service was impeccable ,1
 delicious breakfast great lounging area really comfortable bed excellent shower really helpful pleasant staff all extras needed in room ,1
 i don t like what you spend 500 for two night without ac this hotel has ac but not working,0
 everything,1
 hotel was clean and well located for trip to theatre restaurants staff were friendly helpful ,1
 unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized the location is great which is only 3 munites walk from earl s court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around the room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in london it only takes about 40 munites going from heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in london not very early i will definitely prefer this hotel next time ,1
 poor service tired decor dirty carpets and mediocre food this is not a ritz carlton hotel if you are accustomed to ritz carlton standards you will be disappointed ,0
 the floor was softer than the bed terrible nights sleep ,0
 location close to city center big ben and river thames 5 minutes walk to temple station bed is comfortable,1
 still waiting for a refund despite 3 calls,0
 i left my room at approximately 8 30am for breakfast only to return one hour later to find my room already made up and all my personal belongings removed i travel regularly all over the world and my understanding is that rooms where not entered and made up until you have checked out i did not receive an acceptable reason why this had happened ,0
 the hotel facilities are good and i enjoy their breakfast ,1
 under renovation and not enough elevator the room is narrow and old ,0
 we were 3 families and had 3 rooms one of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used the staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room they kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day they just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower they used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay the hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care the hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations they must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required the only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night ,0
 staff were rude at check in staff were absent from the lounge bar no fitness room didn t bother with breakfast as didn t want to bother with the staff room was adequate but incredibly small just about room to move down the side of the bed if you turned sideways overall very expensive although it was the centre of paris for the little that was provided ,0
 the bed was super comfy we loved the pillows ,1
 we had to wait for an eternity to have a twin room we reserved a twin room on booking to find when we got there they were none available i showed the supervisor the email confirmation of the twin room booking and he said would be a few hours for the room to be ready we checked in at 1800 and the room was meant to be available from 1400 he then proceeded to answer the telephone and speak to another customer i asked to speak to the manager who at first couldn t be bothered to come to the desk to speak to us eventually on us requesting she came out and told us the same thing i said it was unbelievable bad service and what where they going to do for us all of a sudden a twin room became available terrible service on the hotels front won t be staying there again am afraid ,0
 1 tiny room which was actually a converted corridor on the top floor 2 ceiling in bathroom too low unable to shower comfortably 3 breakfast was haphazard two girls were working but cutlery and food not replenished 4 asked for change of room but told this would not be possible no explanation given 5 this was part of my wife s 50th birthday celebrations and i asked via booking com that this might be acknowledged by the hotel despite being told the hotel had acknowledged this on arrival given terrible room and not even a flower in the room 6 sauna wasn t working for the duration of the stay despite being included in the overall cost no remuneration offered it may have been different outcome if we hadn t booked through booking com and instead booked direct with the hotel i won t be using this site again unfortunately we may have just encountered the hotel on a bad day or four but in the context of expectations of the hotel it was a massive disappointment ,0
 the hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when i was checking in what s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident i had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service the hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us after the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred we had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway they were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time as guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless ,0
 range of breakfast options and friendliness of staff,1
 the interior design great location,1
 service overall experience seafood platter in the bar location to o2 views,1
"i came back from zaandam yesterday afternoon after our first stay in the netherlands. zaandam is a quite and beautiful place with every service a tourist needs. the hotel is very near the station. public transport is very efficient though a bit expensive. the room in the hotel was small but comfortable. i think cleaning has to be improved. the guys at the reception were young, very nice, prepared and efficient. i would reccommend this hotel and i will certainly stay there if i visit holland once again.",1
 our room was beautiful with an amazing nighttime view across the river 13th floor staff were friendly and helpful and the location was absolutely perfect for the o2,1
 i found hair on the linen there was no hot water and when the technician came to fix it he walked into the bathroom with dirty shoes and after i complained no one came to clean up the mess,0
 quiet pleasant location a few minutes walk from paddington station good sized room and bathroom ,1
 very good location safe and quiet in latin quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and rer directly to the airport and late afternoon i can always have a recess at the bueatiful luxembourg park around the corner plenty of nice and affordable local and asian restaurants i like especially au p re louis and sushiyaki i stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day this area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service my room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day i saw sunset on effel tower and it was amazing ,1
 tv was placed in the worst possible position away from the bed you could not see the tv from the bed went downstairs to reception to ask for water and i was told u can order room service only for the guy on the other line to tell me ill be charged 5 terrible experience ,0
 the hotel is steeped in history relating to edwardvii and lily langtry and the owners have cleverly merged and preserved the old aspects of the building with a modern hotel eg the entrance dining room bar paintings and staircase the staff on reception were superb polite friendly and very helpful the room was very good clean with plenty of toiletries and tea coffee plus a fridge breakfast was also very good with plenty of choices the hotel is nicely situated close to hyde park and with frequent buses into the central london ,1
 obviously recently updated,1
 staff were just not professional enough,0
 they charged me extra money 460 20 i compliant they promised me to refunded but not returned back,1
 it was the worst experience i reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem they have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room they never contacted us or phoned to say anything moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy ac which we couldn t use to heat the room so it ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed ,0
 what a fantastic hotel having stayed in many hotels in paris this one was by far the best with fabulous staff and incredible location you will not be disappointed if you choice to stay here ,1
 the attitude of the staff the smell of cigarettes everywhere the size of the room the price over 400 euros for the smallest room i ever seen the dirty walls in the bathroom,0
 i don t like they re not helpful that much the noise i couldn t sleep because all sounds get into the room and when you asked for something they took a long time to get it to you,0
 don t use 1 floor never the rooms are like 2 stars hotel ,0
 room size extremely small i think room size quoted included shower room compared to other hotels we have stayed the quoted room size did seem correct tv signal poor on night of our stay picture flickering with distorted sound reception staff not real friendly had to wait at reception for staff to attend desk for check in and check out ,0
 the hotel has had plenty of money thrown at the foyer but don t let that trick you the rooms and adjoining hallways plus lifts are old antiquated and smell of stale cigarette smoke the location is not conducive to anything london has to offer except if you are going to work in canary wharf,0
 great location great service lovely bathrooms with bath and walking in shower 100 quality,1
 staff were extremely rude on multiple occasions i reception bar we weren t checked in properly our room service order was wrong and stone cold dressing gown is 50 no turndown service overall bad experience ,0
 our tv did not work toilet light flickered constantly and there was a giant damp patch on the roof ,0
 check in took 20 minutes hotel was full of arabian families it was like a circus understaffed in reception minibar jammed impossible to get something to drink i will not stay there again ,0
 extreme dirty hairs in the bathroom not been cleaned the mattress was so old and springy i had to request that they added a mattress topper the ro was stuffy even in mid winter and i could hear the above room when they so much as walked it made the ceiling shake didn t sleep was also accused of taking a coke from the minibar ,0
 the room was small breakfast was stale and the eggs tasted like cardboard the room in where you ate breakfast smelt like mould,0
 good location close to paddington and lancaster gate stations near to hyde park ,1
 great location ,1
 position next to paddington station breakfast is excellent evening meals are available ,1
 for a 4 star it was dreadful 2 stars maximum 1st room i was shown into was dirty smelt damp and cramped i asked to be moved the second room was not much better shabby and run down stained carpets broken toilet seat curtains hanging down needed painting wifi was useless staff were friendly but inefficient no soya milk even though i requested well in advance had to wait 2 hours for a small jug of slightly off milk only 1 teabag provided had to ask for more wouldn t stay there again for the price it was very very poor i stay in victoria and pimlico a lot and this was the most expensive and worst i have used so far ,0
 the room and bathroom had a musky smell to it,0
 hotel is situated at the centre whereby market and the train station are at a walking distance ,1
 well equipped gym etc clean hotel next to many public transport stations recommended ,1
 the hotel is very old room are out of date and facilities are not great for a 4 star hotel the walls are very thin so you hear everything that is going on outside your bedroom ,0
 we just loved the hotel ,1
 room far from clean air conditioning was a fan full of dust fire alarm flashed bright green lighting up the whole room in the night got there to discover no lift and no other staff member to help take the bags as my partner is awaiting surgery had to struggle between us staff serving food in flip flops and leggings most certainly not 4 stars i would say 3 and pushing it ,0
 staff unfriendly and let people wait a long time for check in big building site next door with a lot of noise and pollution ,0
 great location a warm welcome from diego lovely room spacious and clean ,1
 me and my friend went to a show at the o2 and stayed the night we got a great deal on price and the stay was amazing the hotel staff were amazing and were there to answer all my questions and help as a disabled guest i was offered information about fire alarm emergencies and felt very safe there the room was immaculate and all our requests like early check in high floor room and extra pillows were given a little dramatic but i cried a little when i had to leave i want to stay again now ,1
 the disrespect by some of the staff with attitude issue ,0
 staff at the club lounge are excellent and very helpful,1
 room rate expensive ,0
 the friendliness of the staff very clean ,1
 the staff are very friendly especially the two ladies in reception luann and cynann they are very helpful and make sure that all your comforts are looked after a special thanks to the concierge staff mr robert who was always willing to help with a smile on his face the entire team is aptly managed by mr ankur who ensures that you leave with pleasant memories a big thank you to all at grand royale london hyde park hotel we will come back again next year ,1
 location front desk staff bartender ,1
 a mostly very young staff were very helpful and added to the stay ,1
 location is best thing about this hotel,1
 it was extremely cold when i got in the thermostat allowed me to put the temp higher but there was only cold air coming in i received a heater which saved me the furniture is very old there are no plugs by the night stands i tried moving the night stand to remove the lamp but to my surprise that plug was smaller than a regular uk plug and there was trash behind the night stand everything about this hotel is outdated the breakfast is very cheap definitely not worth the extortionate amount of money i was charged per night and to top it all off upon checkout i needed an invoice with my company details details which were already provided at checkin and also details which were transferred to the hotel from my booking account needless to say that the guy at the reception had no idea of what i needed and claimed my company details were not provided when i actually wrote them down manually at checkin as well so that s 3 sources for the same information very disappointing ,0
 our room overlooked the train station therefore noisy the bed was a three quarter size not a full double and pushed up against the wall not told about the train and only found out about the bed when booking done customer service friendly but no help at all,0
 the bedroom wall had mould on it deffonetly not a 5 star more like 3 5 star the spa was dirty in the jacuzzi and it was cold i moved rooms due to the mould on the wall and tv turning off by itself and r rrally he room just being very tired around the edges not luxary like a 5 star hotel should be when i moved rooms no one helped me with my luggage and no one took my luggage to my room on arrival i had room service and my mood arrived with tin foil around it ,0
 the reception staff are rude and this thing of charging a extra 50 security deposit on arrival is insulting and insinuating the guest is dishonest booking com should tell us this charge is policy prior to booking ,0
 1 very bad value for money 2 air con didn t work and was told there was nothing they could do 3 old style furniture 4 water pressure bad when complained it was sorted 5 basic rooms are inhabitable and was offered to upgrade to standard room at extra cost felt being misled by your website offer loos ceiling tiles above bed could almost fall on someone s head any time,0
 arrived 12 minutes before check in and had to wait for the 12 minutes before being allowed the key got room to discover the net curtain pole wedged in the window promptly fell down the bathroom was dirty the toilet didn t flush properly and despite booking a room with internet the neolithic age scam is that the internet only works in the lobby if as a guest you are so unreasonable to want internet for the room then that is a scamming 12 50p per day and even then it s slow staff were about as user friendly as a brick to a drowning man on the third day taking the lift down it stopped on floor two for a cleaner who happily threw perhaps a dozen bin bags into the lift around me jumped in pushed the floor for the basement and grumbled at me who had merely said hello and smiled for stopping at the ground floor to get out this is a hotel catering for one off rather than repeat business if you want somewhere purely as a base to explore then ignore the useless staff and enjoy the central location if you are on business for 2 or 3 days then forget it you will be grumpy stressed and no doubt here writing a neg review too ,0
 if if book into number 20 i don t expect to be put into run down number 19 the mezzanine suite was a bedroom above a bathroom i couldn t stand up ceiling too low like being in a coffin just like the film being john malcovich when i complained i was told it was an upgraded room ,0
 though we had a trouble about our room their correspondence was very fast room was stylish and clean amenities was good breakfast was great ,1
 very noisy room 013 directly over tube line asked for a quiet room got the complete opposite,0
 the staff were very friendly and room service was very good even though we couldn t eat everything overall a very nice hotel with excellent views and the price is justified and having been ill for a long time this was a welcome relief and fantastic time was had by all we stopped in a exc suite with a city view we woke up to views of the shard very well worth the money i m glad i paid a bit more but as three of us were travelling splitting this down meant we each paid 80 for one night ,1
 the whole overal hotel very sad and miserable feeling,0
 very comfortable rooms,1
 we had a really warm welcome and felt at ease at the hotel ,1
 the room is small compared to the other room that my friend was staying i booked two rooms supposed to be the same the prices are the same however my room was smaller than the other room it was the side room of a suit room and small the wardrobe is not good the bed cover was not clean the waiter give the spoon which was dropped on the floor 5 minutes ago to one of the guests having his breafast next to my table when he asked for a spoon ,0
 too noisy in the street by night nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until 3 am room too hot area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant 10 min walk ,0
 staff were very friendly rooms were very clean beds were super comfortable liked the touch of a robe and slippers coffee machine in room was brilliant ,1
 really nice comfortable modern hotel staff very friendly ,1
 car parking facilities inadequately explained phones not working in two rooms room standard booked was not provided and had to be changed new room was not to the same standard as booked 24 hour room service not as described in brochure i e nothing other than supermarket sandwiches after 11pm when ordered not delivered both rooms had broken desk drawers flaking paint plaster in stairwell with the exception of one member of staff attitude and advice from staff unhelpful radio did not work ,0
 1 breakfast was not enough finished vegetables you have to be in breakfast room at least 08 00 am otherwise no cucumber 2 there is no air condition or not enough in breakfast room 3 dirty linens we stayed 6 day and a big stain was still there for six days,0
 charging residents for wifi whilst allowing non residents this free my room floor had an intense foul smelling drains odour they failed to deliver an ordered newspaper allowed other guests to smoke in the bar area,0
 good location five minutes walk from paddington station i had a lovely quiet room on the back of the hotel very peaceful ,1
 comfortable hotel very good breakfast buffet style with plenty of choice good views from our room with a small but well equipped gym friendly and helpful staff ,1
 poor food delivered as room service 2 slices dry bread 1 1 2 fish fingers and oven chips 2 sachets of cheap sauce 9 95 4 room service stain on underside of duvet which i left upturned but maids just remade bed putting it on underside again came back after day out to find room door open desk asked if we had shut it when we left maids had been in after we left won t be going back,0
 we had a big problem with air conditioning we had two rooms and in both the air condition was not working they told us that there was a problem and they will fix very soon but they were not telling he truth every time we consulted with the reception they were telling a different story and it was obvious they were trying to buy time we asked them to change he room and this did not happen until after two days of non sleeping because of the heat and humidity i asked to speak to a manager but they said she were busy very un professional staff it was a big disappointment i wonder how did they got a high rating,0
 when i arrived at the hotel they gave my room to some one else and it was already paid by me they gave me a smaller room for a night then moved me to my room but they took the charge for the big room for all the nights as well i kept my card holder in my bag at the room in the hotel when i came back i didnt find it when i told the hotel they did nothing even the managers who works there aneta they tell as that we will do our best for the first mistake and the second one and they did nothing and this is the worst hotel in london ,0
 location and history ,1
 the hotel provided all that was needed from friendly staff at the reception efficiency in check in room service and comforts were ideal staff in all areas of the hotel were most friendly and helpful ,1
 the building facade is great the entrance is great the reception staff are welcoming thanks for the room upgrade due to someone smoking in the original smaller room,1
 the hotel was very friendly spotlessly clean and well situated,1
 room was dirty shower over flowed clearers woke us up everyday at 7am banging doors and talking the kitchen chef did not know what he was doing ,0
 nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction ,1
 everything was good ,1
 wifi connections work the internet however does not the hotel is under renovation because of that access to rooms is organised in a very convoluted manner the part of the hotel yet to be renovated looks rather shabby certainly not worth the price we were asked for our e mail address because it was missing from the file two days later newsletters and commercial offers from hyatt started pouring in ironically the unsolicited messages try to convey the impression that you re given the opportunity to be part of some exclusive club in reality all you get is a small room showing its age at least in that hotel i ve stayed in paris hotels that were cheaper better equipped and much much closer to the city center ,0
 attitude,0
 room nice and spacious big bed comfortable and very clean ,1
 staff were so helpful and friendly and great location,1
 hotel pictures must be old as hotel looks battered it really is in desperate need of a refurb expensive for the standard of bedroom accommodation look around before choosing to stay here as it really is disappointing and not good representation of value for money rooms are small bathrooms not full size general cleanliness poor i did not take my shoes off in bedroom as carpet was so dirty had room not been just a crash pad then i would have complained bedroom furnishings so dated and bashed looks like a run down b b noisy too guests coming in at all times yes i know it s a hotel paper thin walls and located near lift avoid receptionist was not very inviting i must have interrupted her conversion with her colleague to check in prepare for a short stroll to nearest tube when i requested a taxi at reception i was told to walk to the hilton hotel wish i d stayed at the hilton returned to hotel around midnight straight in past night manager who did not even look at me i could have been anyone going into lift breakfast was busy and although looked ok selection all needed replenishing and had to keep asking the 2 waitresses who were so busy for items so i would not stay here again or recommend don t be mislead by the pictures glad that i was solo as embarassed hotel was not my usual standards ,0
 they charge me 30 extra they said for deposit and will refund on 5 days guess what its been a month and no refund i keep phone them they saying they will dort but they dont ,0
 the worst hotel i have ever stayed at they have serious racial discrimination problem to asian tourists room air conditioner was out of order concierges asked me to open the window and cheat me no more available room so disagree to change can you imagine that they charged me a lot per night and i had already pre paid via booking com after more than one hour wrangle the manager aggreed to change another room with air conditioner finally i will never be back again and i have the duty to condemn their disrespect to guests ,0
 staff were really helpful and friendly,1
 lovely room with view overlooking the thames great pillows staff very helpful perfect venue for the o2,1
 the breakfast was amazing so much to choose from there s something for everyone,1
 not very clean had to change rooms as the first one had so many stains on the carpet and someone s hair all round the bathroom second room not much better very basic facilities and very basic room not at all like the photos online ,0
 great location and very friendly staff ,1
 room was too small for 3 of us nowhere to put anything and the bathroom was far too small the carpet was dirty the sink in the bathroom was cracked and dirty as was the furniture no sockets by the beds leading to trip hazards the room was too warm and although we were on the 5th floor we could smell cigarette smoke would not stay here again ,0

 rooms very old,0
 room is too small towels are hard they charge you twice unclean smell in room and hotel,0
 very bad location poor breakfast,0
 housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all once when i returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet also they won t give you enough set of towels even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort they never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday the most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you but only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need e g i have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream they don t provide you with basic needs like slippers cotton pads wools q tips but we saw it in their trolley not even refill teabags milk sugar rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard ,0
 i didn t really like anything about this place other than location for concert rooms are tiny and claustrophobic service is awful so many complaints made by other guests while we stayed there and reception staff couldn t have cared less price is way to high for standard your getting ,0
 rooms were spacious it was a fab hotel for brit awards,1
 not value for money room was noisy very dirty needed serious maintenace cramped with furniture definitely not the room shown on the internet site when making booking we will be telling anyone everyone not to go to this hotel including our travel agency contacts in various parts of the world concierge didn t even offer to take bags to room on arrival or assist with carrying up the fairly steep entrance stairs interior could do with a refreshment of decor to fit the outside heritage appearance ,0
 room v small and could not open window felt very claustrophobic ,1
 staff extremely helpful and knowledgeable,1
 1 wifi is free for only 20 minutes day 2 no safe in room to keep valuables you can hire one at the reception if you want 3 no mini bar fridge in room 4 freeview tv are you serious 5 cheap furniture full of scratches dirty carpets wallpaper 6 i paid 99 gbp per night not including breakfast 7 the room was overlooking a construction site the ugliest view ever i asked to change it for one with a view of the river but got rejected although the hotel wasn t that busy i wonder how this is a 4 star hotel i ve been to 2 star hotels which surely out rank this one ,0
 overpriced hotel rude check in staff and customer relations long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price will never stay here again bvooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at ,0
 room 510 the double room was extremely small and it was difficult for two people to move around the room there was no space to put luggage rooms weren t ready at 2pm as they were still being cleaned daily room and bathroom cleaning was poor ,0
 very friendly attentive and professional staff very comfortable and clean room fabulous building on the whole lovely breakfast ,1
 reception deal nuisance neighbors price unsafe very old furniture,0
 loved the location close to two subway stations big rooms with microwave gym and sauna aurora spa services also great liked the good security on entering the property would go back again especially with families ,1
 very very poor sleep during stay ,0
 no wifi unpleasant staff old management style need a form to go to breakfast not possible to go through the backdoor to walk to the metro despite the fact that it would shorten the way my card couldnt open the bedroom door twice this put me in much delay one the last day and i missed my train i wouldnt recommand this hotel ,0
 difficult to locate the entrance room was stiflingly hot on arrival no room service available wifi was poor ,0
 staff very friendly helpful we received a free upgrade to a suite also close links to the tube as well as many restaurants and shops ,1
 property looked nothing like in the picture maybe it looked like this 10 years ago staff is quite rood not everyone very unprofessional behaviour of one of the receptionists breakfast salami was smeling and tasting like it was out of date would not recommend,0
 hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of english the receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at hotel russell just a week prior when we first arrived in london for the first half of our stay had to request management to sort this out her attitude was non too friendly during this experience as mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well the movie which cost a staggering 8 could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered when i called to check on the reason i was told that it was after 10 00pm and therefore it could not be delivered the original order had been called in before 9 00pm as if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which i had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on friday we were told the reservations were for saturday though i had an email confirmation of that friday being our arrival date we were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved the location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at hotel russell ,0
 a very well organised hotel great location very polite helpful staff very good breakfast would definitely stay here again ,1
 we had a very nice stay 10 days quiet location ,1
 worst hotel,0
 value for money,1
 absolutely horrendous experience accommodation on the border of human dignity i was first shown a room without a window then after complaining i was given a room overlooking a noisy building site two unusually thin single beds pushed together with a gap in between room was not made everyday barely enough soap for a single wash it was an awful and demeaning experience ,0
 everything,0
 from check in to check out everything is lovely,1
 hotel extremely old and worn online photos not current toilet didn t flush basin didn t drain properly dirty brown marks on the bedroom walls ,0
 staff were rude we felt it was our fault when we asked for a new room due to black mould in the shower the receptionist rolled her eyes and audibly sighed when we asked for the other bag they were storing for us during the day the receptionist was rude and unhelpful when i asked for the soya milk i had requested on the booking form i had go and find my own the staff were rude and unhelpful when our door keys stopped working multiple times they opened the door for us then said we needed to sort it out ourselves next time we went downstairs instead of helping us out ,0
 room was a nice size and very quiet quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there we were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing ,1
 hotel room was very dirty bathroom was old and shower didn t work properly the sofas were all torn due to excessive use cupboards had broken handles and some of them were missing coffee and tea had been splashed up the wall bedding was dirty broken air conditioning soiled chairs staff were rude and unable to communicate clearly breakfast was rubbish there was a que of 40 people to get to the buffet and all the tables were dirty,0
 the shower was very difficult hard to use without the water going all over the floor we got used to it but not ideal,1
 location was insanely good staff was really nice interior was great ,1
 this hotel had a lot of character but what really made it special was the service our return flight home was canceled and we needed to stay in paris for an extra few days the staff worked with us to make sure we could stay at the hotel as long as needed ,1
 breakfast expensive and of poor quality ,0
 nice location,1
 2 stars standard the room facility is very poor bathroom standard is very low ,0
 great location room we were in was quite small but many larger rooms available lovely location just a moment from hyde park and close to transportation by bus and the undeground hotel is vintage but is in excellent shape staff was very helpful and friendly and services top notch ,1
 except the bed everything was horrible ,0
 the neighborhood was fantastic with two metro stations 1 minute from the hotel,1
 the place needs a deep clean,0
 they were not helpful at all i had a very bad sitiuation in my country and they didnt change my booking date they are not flexible at all i only requested to postpond my reservation date they said no we can not they do not care about their customer becarefull from this hotel,0
 didn t like it at all construction was in progress stuff lied to us about vacancy ,0
 great location good size room for london with very friendly and helpful staff ,1
 the hotel is in a bad need for a refurbishment everything is old and worn out ,0
 our room was below ground level while the room had be tastefully decorated and was clean the room had a very strong musty smell it was very expensive for the room ,0
 i booked a basic double and got a 7 2 sqm dirty stinking prison cabinet broken bed could only be entered by crawling over the foot end unsafe exit automatic doors didn t open 25 minutes for check in when i returned to ask for the double room as booked they just said take it or leave it but you will have to pay anyway ergo do not go there fraud and unsafe ,0
 if you like the smell of dead boddies go to this hotel one more thing dont try to turn on the ac ,0
 spiders all over the place and the construction noise won t let you sleep at all,0
 close to station but very quiet good value for money at last minute rate ,1
 breakfast,1
 it took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again,0
 a lovely choice at breakfast with freshly cooked food staff were pleasant and helpful good late checkout time ,1
 friendly staff excellent location for waterloo station ,1
 they gave me room 22 when i enter the room i found a lot of insects on the restroom and the bathtub they refused to change the room and only clean it however after 2 hours the insects come again they don t offer any compensation ,0
 undercooked stake,0
 the room we had was for 3 people and it was like a mini apartment with a double bedroom small kitchen area and then the sofa bed set up in the lounge great value between the 3 of us ,1
 bed was great close to shopping staff was tremendously helpful from the time we checked in,1
 pleasant staff friendly yet professional,1
 the lift was faulty and dropped 1 floor while we were in it the door opened between floors which was concerning the staff knew about it but didnt inform us the rooms were small and packed with useless furniture making the room inpractical and difficult to manuvour around the toilet was seperate to the bathroom with poor lighting black walls and sanitaryware so it felt like you were in a torture chamber when using it the coffee wasn t replenished daily and we had to keep phoning reception to ask for more on one morning i had to ask the cleaner in the adjacent bedroom to stop banging around as it sounded like we was trying to break through into our room ,0
 comfortable bed,1
 nothing,0
 air condition was out of order in both our rooms nothing was done regarding that after complains on the front desk throughout our 4 days stay in hotel this hotel is overrated we have been in novotel all over the world and this experience is far the worst ,0
 it s so quite,1
 rooms need to be furnished better and bolts should be usable ,0
 clean and good qualitative room ,1
 the staff couldn t have been more helpful and welcoming our room was lovely clean and modern the bed was so comfortable and the black out curtains certainly did the trick the view from the room up along the river with the o2 in the foreground was great upon arrival we took advantage of the swimming pool and spa area clean and relaxing we went to the o2 for the evening the 5minute walk back to our room was the best part of our entire stay we even had time to call into the bar for a drink and enjoy the views of canary wharf before bed breakfast was fantastic they had everything you could have asked for and more ,1
 super dark room looking over a wall and ugly roof i called ahead to check re view and was never informed about this also sofa bead in suite is not a sofa bed just a sofa with a sheet on it ,0
 miniscule single room,0
 the staff was more than great the room was clean,1
 very small bathroom with mildew found in the shower bathroom sink and floor tiles stained old hvac did not heat the room properly ,0
 every thing i would not call it a 4 star 1 star it is,0
 more relaxing,1
 bed lovely,1
 the room was compact but clean and had extra touches in the bathroom which were appreciated ,1
 poor communication from staff we were not told when we checked in that breakfast was not included so overpriced for just a room then we had breakfast not knowing we were going to get charged breakfast was 17 euros each and was poor ,0
 everything,0
 quiet room although so central possibility of a single room water hot and plentiful bed comfortable hotel clean breakfast lovely newspapers provided ,1
 no air conditioning switched off for winter which should be fine however the heating was turned up high all over the hotel and the windows didn t open more than a crack thus very hot in the room fitness centre equipment needs maintenance as equipment is worn construction everywhere adding floors to the hotel new builds on all side no mention of such when booking cacophonous building noise from 8 am saturday not a great start to the weekend ,0
 great location clean and cosy hotel very good full english breakfast friendly staff ,1
 bar and bar staff lovely great cocktails room huge for a london hotel and great value facilities brilliant ,1
 everything ,1
 location is very useful for heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight the place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good ,1
 everything,0
 great staff clean room good location requested early check in room was available upon arrival ,1
 the only entrance to reception is via a small hoist type lift to the 1st floor for two persons max the only staircase is a fire escape you can exit but not enter on exit you come into a side yard and walk past the rubbish bins and debris to the street there was an apology notice for work being undertaken but this did not affect the restricted entrance and exit the reception was also the bar and breakfast room the bedroom ok but not good value ,0
 staff is great breakfast fantastic and the location is just perfect with a bonus view of the eiffel tower ,1
 everything,0
 excellent staff and room hotel facilities and gorgeous locatio,1
 brilliant access to the o2 and the room was amazing unfortunately didn t get to sample breakfast as we were a little worse for wear after a heavy night but everything else was exceptional ,1
 that o got booked out to the hotel down the road,0
 old air conditioning doesn t work i put that on the coldest and still didn t worked bathroom water system very old it made a bad noise when we were there no place to drop off and pick up ,0
 this hotel is like a tune pod with the added cost of a zero on the end of the bill the bedrooms are so small no proper sink to have a shave the control i pad worked some of the while no way of making a drink no wardrobe just a few hangers my opinion ok for one night not for three ,0
 bad lighting no bath window into communal hallway with a lot of noise ,0
 air conditioning didn t work rooms very poor we expected better at the hilton,0
 house keeping waking you up at 9 am ridiculous,0
 not a bad price and the steam room in the leisure centre was a decent temperature also one of the things we like about the location was discovering the nearby village with very good restaurants ,1
 temperature in small double was above 25 degrees c in february only solution offered was the advice to open the window this opened to a shared balcony fire exit structure which enabled easy access to intruders i hardly slept the 3 nights i spend there staff was polite but did not offer solutions they advised me to contact the hotel manager via mail he reacted a week later and clearly did not care at all this is a well known problem in this hotel i heard other guests who were offered another room against extra costs apart from the heat the room was very basic no chair no working space ,0
 the room was very modern and clean staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special ,1
 breakfast was great,1
 great location very grand in appearance very comfortable,1
 it was very close to the o2 ,1
 room too hot poorly laid out bathroom very small difficult to use,0
 the garden,1
 the bed was really uncomfortable the tv signal was terrible and the room overall needed a facelift very old and tired shower didn t work and the bath had flaky bits in it ,0
 aweful chemical smell in the corridor while the bed was made up the carpet was not cleaned and rubish bins were not emptied ,0
 we liked the views over the park and the spacious suite,1
 central location close to parks and stations ,1
 a c unit was too loud had to move rooms staff wasn t helpful,0
 the room was clean and the staff very friendly and the breakfast was very nice also the location was good ,1
 a room that was a matchbox for my money superior room not dirty nets curtains dated decor untidy paintwork shabby and marked scuff marks no water in room for a 4star hotel website very misleading have you seen the rooms on the 7 th floor wouldn t put my pet up there would not recommended this hotel even with my last breath i felt i wasted my money and time staying there it was disgusting for a four star hotel the entrance is one big front and not in a good way shaftsbury hotels will not ever be on my list to stay in ever again ,0
 missing all the little details that are needed for a hotel in this class ,0
 staff management locked door to get in and then four nights if continuously reproving my identy in four times theynever got the bbreakfast right every breakfast was cold no cutlery no condiments tv was broken and took two days to fix it was a nightmare experience ,0
 bad room service no water given if not ask,0
 i did not have breakfast,1
 location and the quality of the room,1
 room very cold all the time until you call and beg them to heat it a little bit then in the middle of night you should wake up and call again to ask for heathing,0
 housekeeping staff is filthy she wiped my basin with the same gloves used to retrieve something that fell into the toilet bowl i didn t even ask her to wipe the basin she dipped her hands in the toilet bowl and wiped my basin touched my soap and toothbrush with the same gloves when i objected she started arguing all the senior manager could do was say sorry for the inconvenience she took my dustbin to clear and never got it back despite me calling twice i had to throw my personal toiletries away because of the incident was disgusted to use the bathroom for the remaining two days i was there so i was using the common toilet in the lobby also spent two days without a dustbin in the room also the housekeeping staff is slow and inattentive i call asking for body wash and they sent me lotion i call asking for bath towels and they sent me hand towels i was delayed for two meetings on two days on account of this never staying here again,0
 front staff disgraceful charged 150 extra deposit on arrival contrary to booking com guidelines on confirmation no view from room concrete wall,0
 old furniture very bad wi fi i had to beg the personnel for slippers and bathrobe this is unacceptable for a 5 hotel very bad tv channels selection very basic hygiene products in the bathroom extremely expensive for the offered quality of the services ,0
 bed sheets pillow ,0
 thieves i paid in advance via paypal on arrival i advised i had already paid they requested my creditcard in case i used room service the thieves debited the room rate again ,0
 great location also had guest laundry which is fabulous for those travelling for a few weeks ,1
 where do i start 1 horrible location even though it was walking distance from nearest metro porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times 2 its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons we reached hotel about 6pm we went to bed early about 7 30 to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic we spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything 3 entrance thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con ,0
 the staff my complain still didn t get a solution it has been almost three weeks i need a response ,0
 heating og the room not working for the entire stay lamp in the bed not working standing water in the sink and shower door did not flow until after compliants to the reception,0
 good price great location good side view of eiffel tower very good comparing to my other hotels booked in paris which usually have very small rooms ,1
 i enjoyed very much the hotel s theatre bar and the wonderful restaurant the staff was helpful available and attentive ,1
 excellent location room on the small size but that was fine quite liked it breakfast excellent ,1
 everything,0
 it was mentioned during the time of booking that breakfast is complimentary from bookings com but i had to pay as the confirmation had mentioned extra ,0
 didn t have breakfast,1
 clean room free wifi ,1
 the room was tiny there was a big stain on the carpet and the breakfast was horrible ,0
 when they say a small double room i wasn t expecting to have to side shuffle round the bottom of the bed also not the cleanest room i have ever stayed in and bathroom could do with updating ,0
 additional hidden cost extra pay for wifi poor mobile phone reception so no personal wifi either extra pay for gym or pool dated decor unhelpful staff rude reception manager,0
 room comfort free wifi,1
 location is amazing very close to champs elysees staff were so friendly and helpful doing everything to please us and our little dog we were upgrade from classic room to superior room what made our trip much more special the room balcony view is spectacular we had such a wonderful time that we decided to stay an extra night ,1
 couldn t find fault with this hotel perfectly placed for the o2 arena and london sight seeing extremely comfortable room and attractive public places the breakfast is outstanding all accompanied by a fabulous and professional team that really look after you we had a great stay our 2nd and wouldn t hesitate to recommend ,1
 the staff were very smartly dressed extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of the area and amenities car park is very convenient and plenty of spaces available ,1
 location was poor the hotel is looking very tiered the staff were far from helpful it was very noisy and cold i think the later is probably due to the single glazing ,0
 the bed was comfy,1
 letter of complaint submitted with photographs disgraceful bedroom lights not working stains on bed extractor fan filthy mobile radiator in room ,0
 really helpful and friendly staff ,1
 new and stylish quiet,1
 we got upgraded to a club room lord knows what standard is like room 222 almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value bar closed at 11 and breakfast was a whopping 15 each we didn t have it ,0
 the rooms are so small it s insulting and not a fair trade to the amount i spent on them the add on booking com was very misleading and unfair to my perspective ,0
 rooms and location were great good quality hotel ,1
 wifi was really bad in the room and the whole place was being renovated so there was really loud noise all day this renovation was not mentioned while booking and the price was still very high despite this renovation i felt completely cheated ,0
 very small rooms bed was uncomfortable shower flooded the bathroom no bath carpet and mattress were stained expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard ,0
 my friends didn t stay there even for one night because of the receptionist attitude he is so rude and i didnt feel comfortable at all ,0
 the size of the room and the hostility of the staff and manager,0
 no,0
 uncomfy bed very tiny shower average welcome and no explanation at all for how the room worked twice both our cards would not work to open our door and we had to reactivate them at the reception had to activate the internet again with a code daily ,0
 housekeeping did not clean the room every day unless i told them the room did not have wifi access ,0
 bathroom had toilet with window that was exposed to outside with see thru shade i had to place bed sheet to cover it also two warm and no thermostat in room,0
 old hotel everything creaked bed floor boards doors very noisy hotel old bed shower didn t keep constant temp not fit for purpose,0
 couldn t be beater,1
 the breakfast was amazing and the location was good too,1
 excellent centre base for sight seeing would definitely stay here again worth mentioning if you have a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary while staying perfect 10 out of 10 from us ,1
 room was very dirty the bed in the room above us squeaked all night ,0
 the hotel is a beautiful old building and the staff were extremely helpful couldn t do enough for you and very polite the breakfast was fantastic just about anything you could possibly want the room was clean and tidy ,1
 the hotel staff were great super friendly very accommodating the breakfast had a great selection ,1
 beautiful hotel great staff the manager himself made sure all my requests were in place the staff was so helpful and mannered the location is great close to everything ,1
 reception at this hotel checked me in to the hotel room n the afternoon at 10 30 pm they checked in further quests into the same room total strangers walked in to my guest room when i was undressed very poor attitude of management and terrible security and in my case total disregard to my privacy total strangers being given access by reception to my room late at night is reckless and dangerous ,0
 staff very helpful and bar very nice ,1
 opera house la fayette area,1
 nothing,0
 location,1
 small rooms poor breakfast room was ready after 2 hours location far from main attraction no spa very expensive poor room cleaning i have to call and request for tooth brush and paste and coffee no view at all ,0
 disguising cleanliness the carpets are so dirty i would never think of lying or sitting on the floor the bed spread on my bed was so full of dust that my eyes became itchy when lifting it to pull it up or off it took 2 requests to have it changed to a clean one the internet works spasmodically i was moved 3 times in my first day as the first room was so small you could not walk around the bed and it had no tv as advertised the second room had no internet reception the third room had two broken bedside lights which were never repaired but i had given up changing rooms lying in bed at night you can hear all the movement from the rooms next to you and above and even hear them talking my bed only got made properly twice in my 10 days the other days a half baked attempt was made to pull the blanket up without even straightening the sheets the only electrical plug is under the tiny desk so i had to boil the kettle under the desk and charge my phone plug in my computer in the same place my laundry was lost until found included in another room s laundry normally when travelling your hotel room can be a sanctuary from a busy day i dreaded coming back to the hotel every evening and on the weekends made sure that i stayed out all day booking com refused to let me cancel as i had prepaid which given the state of the hotel is a very poor reflection on bookings com as well ,0
 quite place,1
 everything this is no way a 4 star probably some fraud even the receptionist told me that she is leaving and i should not book here again she also said i dont know how they got 4 stars rating ,0
 great hotel and staff,1
 everything from internet access to staff to dirtiness,0
 everything,0
 the staff were wonderful,1
 room very bad,0
 everything is great here it s a new build light airy state of the art hotel but from a staff point of view it s like walking into any of the iconic fancy london hotels the staff are amazing and such nice people couldn t be more helpful the design of the room is thoughtful night lights bose speakers in the bathroom a shoe shine in your wardrobe latest tech so you can link your phone to the 4k tv etc really happy with this hotel also the tea in the clipper bar is to die for even the basic breakfast tea tastes so good ,1
 they charged me extra fees after they changed my room although i sent a confirmation email through booking com that i have 3 children,0
 yes it was good and the room was comfortable the only thing they lack cupboards,1
 we had very late return flight and staff very kindly offered us use a room to rest and wait instead of hanging around couldn t thank them enough ,1
 staff at front desk and cleaning the worst cleaned hotel i have ever seen ,0
 i felt i was misled the room was meant to be superior and it was not there was no room to move to even though i complained ,0
 very nice hotel with excellent friendly staff comfortable rooms and beds very nice breakfast and good food in general i will certainly use it again when in london despite the traffic noise excellent value when booked through this website ,1
 i booked a room of luxe but i didnt see at all how this room is different from regular room nothing special at all the room is very very small and i m 100 sure i can find some room way better than this with 380 euros one night bad experience even the frontdesk is fine,0
 close to tube station and kensington park ,1
 thin walls extremely poor sound proofing could hear quests above and the room next to ours ,0
 this is a grand old hotel currently being refurbished but still very comfortable it is a great location especially if you are catching early morning trains or coming into london late in the day very close to the british museum ,1
 worst experience ever never going to use any of the hotel in this group not worth a try at all ,0
 my clients enjoy the hotels charm and character ,1
 great location excellent facilities attentive and friendly staff,1
 i was really pleased with the service the staff were really friendly i also wasn t expecting such a massive room,1
 everything the staff was arrogant way too expensive hotel the location is remote the facilities are really bad the room felt like a oven very hot and the air conditioner did not work the hotel staff was arrogant and did not help resolve the issue the breakfast spread was really bad for 15 euros one can get much better bfast anywhere else i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and i would file a case against the hotel and demand a refund ,0
 couldn t have breakfast one day because of too many people we had a three person room and the third bed was too small ,0
 the view over the o2 and the thames,1
 small always a bad smell in hotel very small room addicted black man sleep next to hotel in very bad situation terrible environment around hotel i don t suggest to anybody ,0
 location cleanliness friendly staff,1
 the hotels architecture is beautiful it was clean and comfortable ,1
 clean comfortable room,1
 staff were fantastic very helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble ,1
 the staff at the reception was nasty and not helpful at all the room we ve been given that meant to be double was smaller than a single room at trvelodge when we requested bigger room the staff member became verbally aggressive the room was dirty hair in the sink stains on the carpet dirty towels carpet not hoovered stains on the pillowcase feedback form with negative opinion left from previous guest not happy at all do not recommend this hotel to anybody even to enemy ,0
 the room was cold impossible to raise the temperature thanks god we didn t stay long there was no towels in the room when i complained we finally received very old towels pour quality there was neither soap nor shampoo and the maid in the morning woke us up at 8am although i didn t ask for it because it was the weekend and a second time at 5 past 8 when i opened the door to complain the maid was rude the area surrounding the hotel is not safe in the night and some of these people gathered in the loby furthermore in the morning we saw an old man in pijama walking to the shop i expect this kind of hotel in karachi not in london this hotel is a disgrace for the name hilton i will never go back there and definitely never recommend this hotel i have slept in pour quality hotels in russia bulgaria poland and romania before the perestroika but i knew what to expect but this there are no words to describe ,0
 everything basically the room was great the bed was comfortable the location was great and the staff we very welcoming and we particularly liked the happy hour in the theatre bar ,1
 no air conditioning in october ,0
 attitude of staff was poor no safe in room no water in room no glasses in room no fridge in room not able to make any phone calls from hotel local or otherwise tried to use swimming pool at 1815 to be told that although pool closed at 1900 we had to be in pool by 1800 crap next day we were in pool at 1830 and people still coming in all staff were east euopeans whose knowledge and understanding of english varied from average to woeful non existant an international hotel i don t think so oh and the till in the bar didn t work think fawlty towers and you ll have some idea a joke of an hotel wyn lam is the manager who was conspicuopus by his her absence ,0
 staff location,0
 room was lovely and quiet great to be able to set the room temperature bed very comfortable ,1
 great location for hammersmith tube and apollo very comfortable bed and room with great views over london ,1
 staff were extra helpful loacation was fantastic veiw from balcony was exceptional stayed in paris before and expected the rooms to be a lot smaller and was pleasently surprised on how spacious this hotel room and bathroom were would deffo return to this hotel,1
 that i was paying for a 5 and had incoveniences u would meet in a 2 hotel ,0
 good size room and well placed to attend a course nearby food excellent ,1
 the welcome on reception from courtney was outstanding very friendly and professional he is an asset to the company,1
 the staff are aggressive and rude the room is too small the service is bad the bed isn t comfortable at all,0
 all of it,1
 this property is not as advertised rooms are cramped and outdated beds are small with ill fitting linen when booking checking in we were not made aware that refurbishment works were ongoing which caused disruptions with no reception or lounge areas definitely not 4 star and not worth the prices charged ,0
 rooms are tiny hardly enough room for 2 people all power went off in room staff were not bothered and didn t try to rectify problem wouldn t recommend or stay here again ,0
 the location is ideal for getting to the city but the view from both your room and the main areas is appalling from the restaurant you faced a graffiti wall the saturday evening whilst having our meal at the restaurant there was this continuous boom boom it transpired that there was a function on below us and they were sound testing this constant boom boom vibrated throughout the restaurant and we could still hear it on the forth floor it continued until at least 2 30am whilst the food in the restaurant was tasteful again it was not what l would call special it had little choice for vegetarians the family room booked for 4 people upon arrival only had cups glasses and other extras for 2 whilst this may have been an oversight it clearly demonstrated that staff had not read the booking for 4 adults the impression on photos of the room looked like two large double beds with plenty of room this was not the case and it was a tight squeeze for all the general value for money was a huge disappointment and l would not recommend this hotel for families or more than 2 adults per room ,0
 great location with very easy access to public transport and popular location major shopping streets walkable a very comfortable hotel,1
 the room air conditioner was not working properly the staff at the reception was not at all cooperative,0
 the cleanliness was really very poor the staff was impolite ,0
 lady on reception very rude room tiny 9x12 acc didn t work horrible room cleaner kept coming in on second day checking we left even tho check in was 12 woke us up 3 times she came in ,0
 extensive breakfast offer free wifi great connections to london underground at walking distance,1
 woken up by building work in the next door room at 7am dangerous plug sockets in room ,0
 they didn t release the amount that they blocked on my card upon initial arrival although i checked out and paid all my dues i went back to my country and was shocked to see a whopping amount deducted from my account when i followed up they told me the hotel you stayed in never released it i then had to make numerous calls to the hotel in order for them to release the blocked amount and til today they havent they blocked it on june 1 and its june 29 today i felt i was ripped off,0
 room far too warm 25c had to leave window open apparently rooms have no a c in winter hotel very tired needs renovating towels too small breakfast horrible coffee stewed not fresh,0
 location is ideal in the heart of bloomsbury my single room was good with reasonable of space bathroom was very good ,1
 you can see the opinion up,0
 modern clean rooms and friendly staff,1
 as above disgraceful behaviour by both marriott and booking com,0
 dinner menu was very reasonably priced great location for my need ,1
 very attentive staff and very helpful at all times,1
 me and my girl are both 1 80 didn t know french people or so small we were both taller than our beds we both had to sleep with bent legs quite annoying also the rest of the hotel room was just really small and the pictures which you can find on the internet are just misleading i will never book a room in this hotel again unfortunately ,0
 see above ,0
 breakfast was cold and had been left out for a while no fresh batches were brought out the croissants were even tough the bed mattress was so hard it was uncomfortable to sleep on on the day of departure we were refused entrance to the gym and pool apparently even guests have to pay to use these on top of what you pay to stay the night i have never stayed in a hotel where you cannot use the facilities there was no confirmation of this on our booking nor did anyone inform us when we checked in although the location is good only 10 minute walk to canary wharf the view from the room is just of a building site from the moment we arrived the sound of drills were evident ,0
 paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for london rooms are a reasonable size for london and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch definitely would return to this hotel,1
 wow the main lobby and reception area looks gergian victorian and edwardian style good location for everything very close to the bayswater queens underground train station and walking distance to paddington train station lots of restaurants to choose very near also close to hyde park that you can relate with the nature and get some fresh air the place is quiete and peaceful and very relax at room 115 the staffs are friendly and helpful the buffet breakfast was excellent i had a healthy breakfast option this four star hotel is highly recommended well done keep it up the excellent service folks ,1
 friendly helpful staff,1
 excellent choice at breakfast very friendly staff bed very comy reception staff very helpful would definetly stay sgain,1
 after a long journey we couldnt park no plug for the bath took all afternoon to sort cold bathroom bedroom had laminate flooring staff were quite arrogant so many other much better hotels in the area ,0
 wifi is not free i know countires having free wifi in the streets room sealing is horrible i was able to hear the guys in the next room streching elevator broken down and there were no notices or proper help from staff reception and other lines were always busy or no answer lobby was full of hookers not recommended for families the most horrible hotel in london price is so expensive,0
 location and the property as a whole,1
 the ability of the staff to go the extra mile ,1
 my wife had to recover from hip surgery before returning to our country this hotel was perfect for that the staff great and helpful i particularly acknowledge great assistance from tania at the reception desk ,1
 the bed the age of the interior and the abuse that you see i would not recommend to anyone else ,0
 swimming pool including personnel,1
 all good ,1
 bedrooom style helpful staff ,1
 very comfy beds with lovely duvets which were light but very cosy excellent selection at breakfast from continental meats and cheeses to pancakes cereals traditional english and plentyful selection of juices teas etc loved the easy and quick walkway into the o2 we were back in our room 10minutes after the concert finished,1
 small and i think it s only one star not 4 stars,0
 rooms incredibly small had to queue for a table for breakfast one very very small lift very very small lobby i was just wondering how on earth this hotel got 8 3 rate based on what this high rate actually mislead me to the maximum this hotel should hardly get 5 5 maximum ,0
 the whole experience the hotel is over priced for what it is it s not luxury it s a standard hotel with standard rooms and i paid 250 a night for the best room and the room was pathetic ,0
 the staff were all excellent the reception staff especially they went out of their way to make the kids feel welcome ,1
 poor customer service i fell over outside the hotel and when my husband asked for a first sis kit the staff ignored him and carried on serving how rude room was constantly baking no way of turning down headboard part fell off and exposed two long screws bed very uncomfortable overpriced and very tired now will stay at marriott or novotel next time,0
 we loved the room the bed was very comfortable the room was spacious the bathroom was very big location was excellent beautiful hotel ,1
 great location frendly staff nice rooms,1
 the room and the view requested ,1
 near hyde park queensway station friendly staff,1
 booked the superior family room got put into a smaller room as our room wasnt ready we were not happy with this as we had paid for a larger room staff then showed us the room that we had originally booked however this room stank of cigarette smoke i have asthma so it was not suitable for us to stay in there the lady that showed us the room said herself that it was not acceptable and that she wouldnt have stayed in that room either we then got put into another room and got told that there were no others available this room had awful views curtains hanging off the wall electric sockets coming off the wall the mini bar wasnt stocked crumbs on the floor from the previous occupants the ironing board was broken and the room was smaller than what we had originally booked and paid for ruined the trip which was for my mums 60th birthday and her first time to london we will definitely not go back ,0

 hotel staff held my bags and i had to pay 70 quid the hotel is old and dirty never stay here ever,0
 staff were friendly,1
 terrible service when the room filled with water from shower 5 people came after 3 calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes so 3 of us and 5 of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out getting ready for our bussiness meeting breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables not worthy ,0

 our room was in the basement so we had no view apart from a brick wall approximately 2 foot away when we were sitting in the bar on saturday night having some pre dinner drinks my husband caught something out of the corner of his eye and thought it was a spider but unfortunately it was a mouse running around the bar and restaurant we told the staff and they did nothing about it ,0
 good price and location lovely room helpful staff,1
 perfect for our stay,1
 comfortable beds great location ,1
 friendly staff good qualty for a reasonable price,1
 nice modern clean decor great location close to tube and taxis many restaurants or coffee places during the week quite dead in the weekend close to theatre area trafalgar square etc,1
 the staff were exceptional we had a very warm welcome as we arrived at the hotel and from liz on reception all of the staff were professional and genuinely friendly throughout our stay ,1
 everything from the reception greeting of luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception the cleaning staff were polite and warm my standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room ,1
 nearest to subway,1
 the staff at breakfast picking up plates and other things from the table before we had finished eating the bar was worse very uncomfortable staff walking around all the time asking could they get us another drink when we hadnt finished the 1 we had we didnt get a chance to relax carpet in bar was in nead of hovering tv in room didnt work had to wait for ages to get through to reception girl overcharged for food had a big problem geting it sorted,0
 everything does not fit to a 4 star rating ,0
 key cards wouldn t work with the room door we were promised a court yard view which didn t happen ended up looking at an office block plus you could hear the tube vibrating through the room building,0
 had to wait 45 minutes for my room as they had double booked us and even now i m not sure if it was a deluxe very small they did give us two free drinks tokens asked for guinness and well it was awful also waited 45 minutes for two sandwiches on room service unfortunately we had to cancel as we had to leave tried to get in through the front door but was informed that we had to go round the back outside areas were full of cups and glasses and no ashtrays which is very strange for a smoking area ,0
 rooms are very small beds is smaller than the room if you turn one side you would fall down on the floor towels are not clean no air conditioning room was very hot even if i open the window,0
 cleanliness it was very dirty and we inform but no change,0
 easy access to underground clean room with a nice garden friendly staff,1
 location and reception staff,1
 cracked tiles in the bathroom expanding foam exposed in the kitchen area general cleanliness was not great paid extra for use petals everywhere and only got a heart on the bed paid for parking and had to park 5 minutes walk back to hotel all round not massively impressed ,0
 the staff and the room were very good and we had a bowl of complimentary fruit we did not eat there other than a complimentary birthday cake which was brought to our room jade on reception was very helpful,1
 the bed was so comfy had the best night s sleep,1
 i had a very comfortable small room overlooking the square the bar has a good atmosphere to relax in after an exhausting day and to enjoy a light meal the underground is nearby which makes it easy to get around in london,1
 the hotel is new and very comfortable the spa area is fabulous the staff are welcoming friendly and efficient the rooms are spacious and well furnished the views from the hotel across the river and london are breath taking there is a walkway between the hotel and the o2 arena on event nights ,1
 i wonder how this tiny hotel been given a rate of 4 star personally it should 2 star hotel only facilities availabe is a small gym breakfast room is very worm with uncomfortable seating the rooms been refurbished but aircon are not working in some rooms very small reception area with very few seating plus that elevator are out of service the wifi signal are very week that i couldn t use at all unprofessional day manager with bad attitude careless stuff totally waste of money to stay in this ,0
 staff,1
 room was compact but very comfortable and quiet staff friendly and close to great transport into centre ,1
 the staff were amazing the food was lovely less than 5 minutes walk from the o2 slightly expensive for the price of the room given its only good for the o2,1
 all the rest we were in the lower ground room lg5 which feels damp smells of tobacco and looks like a badly converted cellar the room and the whole experience was probably worth 40 less than the price we paid ,0
 arriving after an overnight flight to find the room i had arranged was not available even after a long email exchange on the matter meaning that staff members had to sleep together even though inappropriate because a cot would not fit but still being charged for an upgrade the sinks were clogged and the temperature controls had no effect i also had suspicious bug bites each night when i showed them to staff they asked for my email to follow up and i never heard anything after that ,0
 great location for eventim apollo theatre nice walk round hammersmith bridge a 10 minute walk away breakfast excellent make sure you spot the regular toaster lots of channels on tv nice toiletries very nice staff in breakfast room ,1
 staff very good and the room was clean and fresh,1
 best location for covent garden theatres restaurants and the south bank and its attractions are a short walk away i ve never slept so well the beds are great willy wonka afternoon tea a must all the staff are helpful and friendly will defiantly be back ,1
 they had some issues at bayswater grand royal so placed me in paddington one was lovely room friendly service nice shower really enjoyed ,1
 great location friendly helpful staff,1
 staff was stupendous,1
 excellent staff and room facilities,1
 stayed here as we were attending a concert at the o2 the room was nice with a great view of the river and the breakfast was very good cant speak highly enough of the quality of the food and the service from the staff in the peninsular restaurant first class ,1
 always stay in a hilton hotel when travelling this was my first time in london and the first time i have been so disappointed in a hilton hotel beds uncomfortable had to pay for wi fi television didn t work shower didn t turn off four plug sockets in the room only two of them worked staff were unfriendly i have never came across such unhelpful people everything was too much hassle for them and as for the gym and pool facilities it was very poor was going to make a complaint at your how was your stay desk but there was a couple who were there for ages complaing about pretty much everything i have listed the manager only seemed interested in keeping the couple quiet as other hotel guests were checking in and didn t want them knowing what the hotel was really like this hotel is terrible and not worth the money ,0
 that i wasn t aloud to have the breakfast i paid for on arrival and now i cant get my money back the staff could work out with in them selfs that my breakfast was paid and refused me refund is denied don t want to stay at any other of their hotels ever thank you,0
 quality of breakfast,0
 booked a double room got there to be told they were out of double rooms but we could have a twin we were celebrating a 10 year anniversary they then arranged for a small double we got up to the room it was a box room with a single bed went back down and told the only other option was the twin ,0
 the bed,0
 well decorated and comfortable room with big balcony window we like the location of the hotel very much and have been back a number of times when in paris ,1
 great location for the purpose of our visit easy access to the tube pleasant staff tasty food,1
 small rooms and no service hotel rooms need refurbishment ,0
 they didn t warn you that the hotel is near a construction so it is very noisy even in weekends 7 am soft mattress the water kept running out off the shower when i called to reception complaining about it they asked me to come downstairs to get an email so i had to go downstairs at the middle of the night and after they gave me the email to send my complaint i asked to talk with the night manager although he was there he took his time to attend me he ordered me to sit down because i refused to do it he left me talking by myself very rude and impolite i wrote to the email they told me asking for refund and until now there has not been any response from the hotel the business i attended was with london people and when i shared my experience they told me that the hotel has a very bad reputation on customer service but it was too late this have been one of the worst hotels i ve ever stayed i was so angry because when booking i asked for a quiet room they should have told me of the near construction ,0
 position was excellent for our needs not a lot of good restaurants nearby other than hotel itself ,1
 very clean friendly staff excellent breakfast,1
 room should should include breakfast toiletries should have included tooth brush and body lotion ,0
 staff very helpful perfect location nice comfort and service like spa restaurant ,1
 the place was filthy dirty ceiling was ripped when we checked in and saw we asked to check out and for a refund they refused and insisted they charge for 3 nights a manager on duty called jamal the worst hotelier we have ever seen he was so disrespectful and laughed at what we said when we were complaining about the cleanliness made us feel very uncomfortable as guests and he was so rude ,0
 staff and food were lovely,1
 beautiful clean room fab shower very quiet and comfortable,1
 location breakfast restaurant staff,1
 i liked every single thing about my stay amazing staff superb location outstanding services provided by all staff and they are willing to do whatever to help and make our stay pleasant ,1
 the staff was very rude they were not friendly in the welcome they seemed upset when we joined the breakfast last minutr and they appeared to be more friendly only when leaving the hotel indeed they were the most rude staff i have ever seen in a 4 stars hotel ,0
 what can i say this hotel was beyond amazing we had the most perfect view overlooking the o2 arena bed was like sleeping in a cloud so comfortable staff was incredibly polite attentive couldn t want for anything more feel very lucky to stay i have stayed here thank you ,1
 do not go there if you are not parisian the room for 500 euros for a night does not cost it if the hotel discriminates you in any way service was horrible even the restaurant at the hotel refused to receive an order for a dinner plus even cleaning personal was rushing us to leave the room to clean it i am shocked with this service i do not recommend this hotel it was the most expensive and the worst hotel i have ever been ,0
 pretty much everything hotel is a 2star masquerading as 5 star to boot it s dirty ,0
 awful experience nothing like photos online way too small for the price,0
 cramped mean looking basic room and amenities no wardrobe hardly enough space to open your cases just a horrible atmosphere and a characterless place to stay if you are on holiday in london the staff are surly and unhelpful everything is too much trouble for them there are extra charges for everything hidden in the small print at check in definitely not recommended and it does not deserve a high rating the reception appeared to be constantly busy handling complaints from clients ,0
 friendly helpful staff lovely reception area bar and communal areas close to hyde park and tube station just around the corner ,1
 location was very good as we could walk from paddington station with our overnight bag the staff are very good and friendly and efficient nothing too much trouble did not eat there so can t comment on this sorry tea and coffee and extras in the room were very good nice big tv and enough towels provided controllable heat for room was good too ,1
 everything was perfect ,1
 staff were very helpful,1
 very unpleasant experience due to the lack of reactivity regarding payment options a simple authorization form from my company asked upfront would have avoided the threat of eviction on my second night very poor hospitality from the hotel and especially from the manager passport confiscated and apologizes requested on my part after publicly humiliating me for not being able to charge the entire stay on my personal card 7 day wifi and cell reception not properly working in my room ,0
 location was excellent,1
 reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them ,1
 everything was just spot on views out the window were superb all the added luxury s were great great value for money considering location ,1
 staff at breakfast were very good concierge staff security staff were excellent very helpful good breakfast for the money ,1
 the room is very clean and the facility is very thoughtful,1
 the rest is awful terrible room quality small thin door you hear everything no renovation in room,0
 worst location ,0
 everything excellent hotel year in year out it is our fourth time there in four years the quality is constantly top ,1
 bed sheets did not smell clean fusty body odour shower head dangerously close to light fitting,0
 my room was noisy so hot dirty windows and bathroom the overall stay was a nightmare the location was fantastic they tryed to charge me 40 pound a night on my car when it was two bank holiday so u can park for free overall the hotel ruined my christmas,0
 staff is very friendly and helpful excellent job from all the people working there from the restaurant to the reception flawless food was good as well ,1
 fantastic location with hyde park and the tube station great looking inside and out relaxing atmosphere great staff clean rooms fast wifi,1
 no windows and noise not noise insulation,0
 lower the price and rating as this hotel does not meet the standard it is priced at ,0
 fantastic location nice modern rooms very helpful staff ,1
 our belongings were held to ransom at 1am as the check in staff had charged us an incorrect rate we were not even allowed to collect our belongings and leave until we paid more ,0
 everything ,1
 breakfast,1
 the check in formalities the rates of property is high compared to full 4 star service hotel,0
 location friendly efficient staff character of hotel,1
 comfortable hotel in convenient location,1
 room was too small carpet was dirty only one small bottle of complimentary water was given though we were a family of four not value for money extra 200euro was taken but not returned in cash at the time of checkout and till date i did not receive it through my credit card ,0
 staff were really helpful friendly ,1
 no staff speaking good english problem with tv and slow to fix it full english was cold and to very poor standard ignored when it come to tea and coffee bed was old and gave back ache,0
 the location great and clean and modern room and stuff ,1
 there were massive amounts of construction work being done just outside our room this massively impacted our trip in a negative way couldn t hear myself think in the morning let alone sleep raised this with the staff and got a rude response that nothing could be done ,0
 lovely old hotel very grand very comfortable,1
 location location location you can not beat this location if you are traveling with kids we were steps away from the london eye and enough children activities to consume a full day when tired we easily walked back to the hotel the next day we were within walking distance to the waterloo train station all of the hop on hop buses stopped near by and the city buses ran through the night with stops very close to the hotel at the end of a long day it was great to lay in bed with big ben and the london eye as my view no need for an alarm clock just look up and big ben was close enough to tell you the time can t wait to stay here again ,1
 unfortunately when we arrived to check in we were told that we were being moved to a sister hotel the paddingtond grand on the far side of hyde park it was said that it was because of problems with plumbing in our original room this was well outside the kensington area where we needed to be contrary to what reception staff told us i have no evidence that any attempt was made to inform us beforehand there was no practical possibility of making alternative arrangements a taxi service was available but this inevitably took time we found this to be exceptionally poor service which distrupted our weekend it was clear that we could have been informed beforehand that the hotel was not available but were presented with a fait accompli which put our requirements far down the list of their priorities ,0
 without exception all the staff we met were fantastic polite professional friendly and helpful the breakfast was excellent with a good range of good quality well prepared food the room was amazingly quiet could hear no other guests or any traffic outside the window ,1
 breakfast location metroconnection to airport and not far from the centre ok,1
 everything in the room was wrong,0
 the staff were extremely helpful polite and welcoming and location was perfect ,1
 very friendly staff lovely and clean good value ,1
 where to begin the rooms are tiny i stayed in a single room and it was by far the smallest hotel room i have ever experienced the single bed was not full size and i could not lie down entirely the wardrobe that reduced the size of the bed would not open fully as there was a wall in the way and did not have capacity to hang a suit and shirt the staff were incompetent my business trip plans changed a number of weeks in advance of the stay as such i would be staying for 1 rather than 2 nights when i informed the hotel of my change in plans weeks in advance of my stay they advised that the extra night could not be refunded as i had selected an advance purchase rate this is a fair position however when i suggested that perhaps there was something else they could do for me upgrade room for 1 night etc as i would be paying for 2 nights but only staying for 1 i was simply told no very poor customer service and they simply sought to take advantage of the change in my plans without thought for the customers position upon arrival i sought to pay with the business card that i had used to book the hotel the staff were unable to facilitate this and i had to use my personal card to pay for the 2 nights of which i only used 1 on my personal card again the staff were extremely unhelpful upon proceedings to check out after 1 night the reception staff could not understand that i was not staying the second night despite the fact that i had advised the hotel weeks in advance and at check in that i would only be staying 1 night the staff at check out were unable to provide an invoice for my stay and were again entirely unhelpful to the situation the hotel needs to invest in staff training as a matter of urgency in addition to review of the room size and layout my one night was simply an awful experience and i will not be returning ,0
 the interior of the building is a disgrace an executive double rm 104 cannot be true as very small with only a single chair ,0
 very clean and spacious thank you for the upgrade ,1
 the bed was really comfortable shower was amazing and the staff were so polite and friendly,1
 rooms recently refurbished smart modern comfy at the price we paid value for money not sure if the special rate will always be available hotel being totally re furbished no noise during evening times ,1
 very poor condition no facilities definitely bad value,0
 the room had not been cleaned upon our arrival there was stains on the carpets and the towels were not clean at all there was thick dust around the bathroom including the bin and window ledge we would not stay here again ,0
 this is one of the best london hotels i have ever stayed in i will stay again,1
 the room was fantastic with views of the thames staff were very attentive the access to the o2 was very handy ,1
 the heater is very very loud and you cannot sleep when it is on i ask the reception for a solution and they promised to fix it but they never follow up it happened every night till the last night we spoken to the night manager and he himself managed to give us a portal heater what they were able to give us from the day 1 as i booked the room in non refundable rate for the first time even if i wanted to leave the hotel first day they charged then i stayed hoping for an improvement i had just one night sleep out of 4 nights stay all the furnitures got old and need to be replace for a five star hotel the floor carpet is dirty and ipod doc is still suitable for iphone 4 no body cares about you and the worse feeling is ignorance even when i wanted to talk with morning manager at the check out he told me he is going to follow up the case and email me which they send me an email few hours after i left the hotel with the note that we checked and during your stay it was all the time the room temperature 25 but they never mentioned that if you turn on the heater for not freezing you cannot sleep because it is the noisiest the point is that i was already there and i was unsatisfied maybe i felt better if they left me an excuse note during my stay after all you will feel cold ignored stayin in a moderate facilities room it is a 3 star hotel now it was better in the past ,0
 location was good breakfast was also good,1
 the room was very comfortable and the in room services we excellent ,1
 proximity to the o2 friendly staff bedroom,1
 goog location close to waterloo station the room on the city view has nice view of london eye,1
 the nice breakfast and beautiful entrance,1
 room and bathroom very nice and decent size,1
 proximity to the o2 was incredible staff were very friendly swimming pool was incredible bed was unbelievably comfortable all in all one of the best stays at a hotel we ve ever had would definitely recommend ,1
 the overall hotel was fine would love to return when the building work is complete,1
 good location within 10 minutes walk of paddington quiet location with great facilities and pleasant staff easy access to travel points and only 5 minutes from kensington gardens ,1
 there was no hot water,0
 i like the location near paddington station and other transportation options the room was a nice size and comfortable ,1
 bed was nice and comfortable location excellent within 5mins walk of 3 tube stations lancaster gate bayswater and paddington and absolutely value for money will definitely be back soon good and helpful staff especially andrea at the reception ,1
 see above,0
 perfect location,1
 the room is big and the bed is very comfortable,1
 staff very rude,0
 wifi free,0
 we were met by the valet parking attendant and the concierge who took our bags the check in took 5 minutes the luggage along with ourselves were in our room within 15 minutes of arriving excellent front of house service the room was excellent great views across the river thames on the 18th floor there is a sky bar with an excellent selection of cocktails and craft beers at night panoramic window which over looks canary wharf mimics the manhattan skyline well worth a visit just for this,1
 very pleasant staff no smoked fish was displayed at breakfast but on request a special dish was prepared for me large well designed and equipped room which was quiet as requested ,1
 bed was very comfy,1
 good location between the major metro lines and tidy efficient rooms great bed trendy oberkampf caf s pubs and restaurants just around the corner the best location to stay at in paris ,1
 spotlessly clean hotel with friendly staff and an excellent location,1
 my account was hacked ,0
 upon arrival we were greeted and told we were too early to check in which we knew anyway we then didn t check in until 10pm as we were in the city all day we were given a room on the lower level which was below ground our room was actually situated right next to the kitchen and restaurant which was very noisy at 7am the following morning as we were on the bottom level you could clearly hear the tube trains running underneath throughout the night our bed was also a pull out bed in a hotel which cost 166 for one night we slept in a pull out bed overall awful experience for a hotel that we were expecting to be extremely nice ,0
 can t open any windows not even one inch and breakfast you pay for only includes continental and you have to pay extra for a proper english breakfast which when you consider you are in the capital of england you would expect as norm ,0
 location,1
 terrible internet room in the basement with plastic foil on the windows and a size of a closet,0
 january 2017 selected as guest of the day and provided with a complimentary room service upgrade novotel hammersmith london uk continues to provide a superbly attentive service friendly beautiful staff a credit to the novotel brand within a contemporary environment on the outskirts of central london so it s in a quieter location and provides value for money the premium room is superbly decorated with a large double bed that is like sleeping on a nimbus cloud for seven hours the provision of high quality absorbent towels in the walk in shower were a delight to use after stepping out of the rain storm like overhead shower the free to access wi fi is consistent throughout the building rooms the bose sound bluetooth sound system was a pleasant surprise overall excellent even if you are not upgraded all the rooms are very good quality and the serve yourself eat as much as you like breakfast is truly remarkable value for money i hate to recommend novotel hammersmith to you as it may mean it would be difficult for me to reserve a room in the future but i will wholeheartedly ,1
 the pillows some rooms are really small ,0
 cute and comfortable room ,1
 hotel needs refurbishing,0
 staff is helpful i was offered an upgraded room,1
 spacious room for london hotel good value for money for london ,1
 first for one hole day there was no water supply we couldn t even use the toilet second the furniture in the hotel wasn t in good condition with regard to the rooms it was quite old and used definitely i don t recommend this hotel to anyone should be a 3 stars hotel instead a 5 stars luxury hotel as they say ,0
 bathroom was broke had a leak in my bathroom first time and the manager insured me next time i come back things will be better this time the toilet seat was broken and they didn t even offer me anything a part from fruit and water i don t think this a standard of 5 star hotel,0
 superb once again ,1
 the rooms were really small and there was no privacy in the room if someone is showering u can see also internet dis not work for 5 days talking to reception they told us they cant do anything the turn on the fire alarm scared us thinking there was a fire where it was just a test aircondition was misrabel we wake up sweating,0
 good location and beautiful building and the bed was comfy easy walk to theatres shops and sites,1
 great bar and residents lounge unique smart small modern rooms but no smaller than is the norm for this quality of hotel in london it is london that most expensive of cities in a tiny country where living space is at a premium ,1
 nice staff and perfect location ,1
 cleaning and comfort was not good and the value for the money was not correct,0
 it is one of the best place i have ever seen ,1
 staff were very attentive and friendly ,1
 everything photos displayed was no where seen in that property no documents to be signed handed over at check in charged twice despite paying at booking com staff especially the gentleman if he really is was the most rudest person one can expect in hospitality business will never recommend this to anyone suggesting to sleep on road than going to this hotel,0
 first i found out that they charged my total stay to my cc before even checking in i checked out yesterday i am now advised by my bank they charged extra without any advise given to me which is not legal this is the last time we stay in this hotel and with this chain,0
 cleaning woman was so horrible and annoying i was packaging and did not speak french one cleaning woman knocked the door and directly came inside my room and shouted to me then she behavioured so shockek so unhappy and could not stop loudly speaking french near me i donot understand anything and just smile and tell her i donot understand then she went to pick the phone near the bed to call the reception or somewhere then back near me endless talking then show me the time and left the room too horrible i lost my face cleaning form in hotel when i checked out tge reception mentioned a city tax 30euros which nobody told me when i checked in and lived there the first day bathroom room water could not go down then someone fixed it after complained ganz fuchtbar ,0
 size of room for 230 peculiar sized en suite so tiny i had to get in the bath to turn the tap on hotel bar shut after show was sent to another hotel 15 minute walk this was closed too the male staff on duty arrogant rude so much money for very little in return breakfast was really nice shame about the waiting staff i even received a tutt after ordering an orange juice unless you re a group of 7 guys who came in off the street they were treated very well also why was the hotel fee reserved 2 days before from my account i use booking com because no money changes hands until i check out ,0
 room was very modern and comfortable,1
 seems all rooms didn t work well for me the 1st one room 506 the heater didn t work the second one 509 was very small the last one 319 was something wrong with the electricity it went off the whole room in the night so i had to bring my baby out from the room ,0
 bed was so comfortable staff we very helpful had a nice stay at this hotel,1
 the staff were friendly and helpful at breakfast a waitress did not understand what we ordered but it was changed very quickly ,1
 i was staying in the langham london on the opposite side of the street for 3 nights on business i decided to move hotels for 1 night due to cost but did not expect such a drop in standards given the location of the hotel the general condition of the hotel was very tired and worn the staff were at best ok but certainly not well trained given that they are in a service industry ,0
 i stayed here for 7 nights and breakfast was provided with the price of the room the location i very convenient close to several metro lines and also a 10 15 minute walk from major attractions like the seine notre dame pantheon sainte chapelle etc the area felt very safe and there are tons of restaurants and cafes nearby it is also a short distance from shopping areas staff was very friendly and helpful the room we had was facing the street and we got a great view of a nearby chapel and the water fountain and in the evenings musicians would be playing at the cafe downstairs we were also surprised that the room was a bit bigger than what was in the pictures online breakfast was included for us which was great because the food was definitely solid and there was a wide variety to choose from i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be in the center of paris close to tourist attractions ,1
 staff where poor my mum booked this hotel for me and my partner and paid for it up front but the staff did not listen and wanted us to pay for the room again and then return my mum s payment which she had paid 2 months before the trip they appeared to have no common sense and no i would not say here again ,0
 my daughter and i travelled by train to attend a concert at the o2 arena the location of the hotel close to the station and the covered walkway from into the stadium were ideally situated to facilitate this the view from our room was stunning the beds were really comfortable and the staff were friendly and polite i would definitely stay here again,1
 i didn t like the look of the executive double room we we re staying in the bed was clearly very old as it has a dent in it and made a lot of noise as well as the room being muggy and old had to pay an extra 7 on top of the 22 breakfast charge to have breakfast in bed which annoyed me ,0
 clean ,1
 the rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use 2 rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either ,1
 the private walkway to the o2 arena was the icing on the cake perfect ,1
 they could not address the critical repairs needed ,0
 the room was very nice but not much space around beds to move around with four in the room we had a fantastic view of the the london eye but not much of the city from the 6th floor the staff were very friendly and helpful a great hotel that treated children warmly as guests it was very crowded in the breakfast area and they opened up the bar area to serve as many guests as they could the mini bar area with extra sink was very nice as was the very clean bathroom with a defogging mirror ,1
 hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent ,0
 staff and suite were great,1
 professional and courteous staff who always had a smile on their face especially bernard concierge lovely room which was immaculately clean and extremely comfortable we received a bottle of sparkling wine and some lemon cake in our room for our 25th wedding anniversary which was a really nice gesture from the hotel a well presented breakfast with quality items along with good service as to be expected ,1
 the breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated we especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled great taxi service was provided when requested ,1
 too small few steps right after opening the entrance door it is dangearous,0
 nothing to likr as i said i feel like being cheated for the money paid ,0
 the rooms are small pillows and towels stained mattress very hard and uncomfortable and quilt not suitable for 2 people ,0
 close to train station,1
 beautiful older hotel with modern rooms ,1
 enjoyed the afternoon in gym pool sauna,1
 expensive the curtains would not cover the opening with the room at pavement level i found an old sock behind the curtain the tv wires were hanging down from the wall mounted tv which i had to re connect due to the tv not working burnt iron provided ,0
 comfort bed,1
 a lot of things cleanliness was not great service at reception wasn t great constant noise though the whole night even when changing rooms and the bed was terrible parking was not great,0
 1 the room did not correspond at all to the pictures advertised on the website nor did it comply with the basic standards of a room of that category the mattress was broken the available space for walking storing luggage was minimal say extremely limited making it nearly impossible to reach the bathroom without stumbling on something bed crammed in a box only one side was accessible 2 the level of noise early morning activities made it impossible to benefit from a good night s sleep laundry washing machine next door washing machine was leaning on the window activated early in the morning around 8 am during the weekend unacceptable noises and banging doors from the nearby breakfast room started as early as 7 am again unacceptable ,0
 the room was too small i was a solo traveller and even i had difficulty in getting in and out of the room the toilet to say the least was terrible i could not even enter the bath overall i would avoid this hotel as the location is also not great its an area you would like to avoid for stay in paris ,0
 my details were wrong on database offered biscuits cheese and wine but never materialised very poor gym facilities ladies sauna not working very dirty room felt like i was treated as though no one wanted me there will not return ,0
 lack of professionalism lack of customer focus poor manners smelly bathroom noisy room old stinking carpets lack of taxis around general manager should not represent this hotel as she brings harm to it i used to stay in radisson blu each time that was the last time i did it ,0
 this is no place for a solo traveler the single rooms do not even have enough room for a chair they are right on the very busy road with high traffic volume and terrible noise including ambulances from a nearby hospitals my room was hot even in september no ventilation ,0
 we had a really bad experience and do not recommend the hotel at all it s only advantage is the large pool in the middle but everything else is horrible designed and highly overpriced please don t stay there if you want to have a quiet and relaxed holiday experience you will not get it ,0
 room too small ,0
 the worst ever hotel i stayed extremely low quality hotel service and bad room condition ,0
 staff was ver rude didn t want to help me i asked for a heater because room was very cold they didn t bring it for me or took any notice and i cathed a cold now i have chest infection that i had to go hospital last night very bad service,0
 staff amazing food was beautifully presented and well priced perfect location for o2 loved 18th floor bar and cocktails amazing,1
 great bar service and jazz night,1
 comfortable bed and lovely and clean ,1
 first class bed,1
 dirty and dusty room ,0
 i was upgraded to a suite and had great view and a rather spacious room,1
 rooms were very noisy decor old i ate in the india restaurant food was poor service was slow ,0
 location,1
 last minute deal that made staying here affordable for an overnight trip and the hotel lived up to its marketing as an executive environment very plush with great staff ,1
 the bed and pillows were like fluffy clouds the room and view were both amazing didn t want to leave ,1

 focus on design over comfort in room no drinks facilities in room no exterior windows room felt overpriced for what it was not especially close to a tube line,0
 staff yelling room service at 2 am 3 am and 4 am down the entire hallway breakfast that wasn t worth the money double bed was two singles placed next to each other tried to use the iron it blew the fuses in the room had to flip switches had to hold kettle in a specific way on the platform to boil water for cup of tea ultimately neither my fiancee nor i got a sustained amount of sleep and were both exhausted as we were walking in ,0
 dirty bathroom and old,0
 toilet not flushing left a note to the cleaning personnel but it was still not fixed the second day of my stay really pricey for what it offers very normal and small rooms ,0

 staff in this hotel is awesome ,1
 i booked this for my wife who was traveling on her own first time in london i went for a better quality hotel thinking that the service and hotel would be very accommodating ohh i was so wrong i set the booking as a late check in and as my wife got there at 11pm due to traveling long distance when my wife at the hotel very tired and wanting to sleep and rest the hotel reception would not allow her to check in as she did not have my credit card when i booked through booking com i said that i would not be traveling and i was booking it on her behalf i asked to speak with the reception team as my wife is a foreign to try to explain the situation reception declined and was trying to chuck my wife out of the hotel and treat her like a tramp of the street i rang the booking desk and a man said there was noting i could do unless i paid again so with my wife now crying i had to transfer money to her account so she could get a room so now i have paid twice something i was not happy about reception said to my wife i could call the manager tomorrow that s very helpful after 30 minutes of waiting on hold to speak to booking com apparently the only person who could sort this mess was them i spoke to a nice man that rang the hotel and then they said the had refunded me and could take 48 hrs still no money and they had upgraded her if the room was a upgrade i would of loved to see the first room a ground basement floor room not only this but when i booked i asked that i did not want ground floor as i wanted upper floor for better safety for a single women on her own i have worked in hotels for over twenty years and single woman are always put on upper floors this is one of the worst experience i have ever had to deal with my wife some distance away and me at home looking after my young children worrying if my wife will be on the streets of london all night ,0
 i was given standard room aka closet room smaller than a cruise ship cabin but i had booked a superior room i had to call booking com to correct this dishonest downgrade ac didnt work even though hotel description says it has ac in every room shower licked into the bathroom creating a mess breakfast beyond mediocre 8 floor building with one minuscule elevator installed in 1972 ,0

 staff were extremely helpful and let us check in early and the hotel is in a great location,1
 we arrived and the room smelled as someone smoked there before we arrived the ac system is really bad and there was a problem with the restroom and the whole room smelled as garbage for 2 days really not worth the money u are paying ,0
 fantastic building and interior design added bonus of park setting ,1
 the location it was so close to the london eye and the rest of the popular attractions that it was easy for my wife to go with the kids while i attendend a course at the hotel the rooms were comfortable and fair enough space ,1

 i ve already wrote about millenium gloucester bad experience the room was disgusting there were poo in the bathroom and it was dirty hole on the floor never seen something like this eventually they changed room but they charge other money never again in this hotel,0
 room was very spacious,1
 it was appallingly bad value for money equivalent to a 3 hotel at 5 prices the hotel is clearly profiting from the proximity to the station to charge crazy prices my room was dark drab overlooking a drab apartment block carpet was stained facilities were basic it is nothing like the photo displayed on the various web sites ,0
 service facilities cleanliness,0

 my room was pervaded by a very unpleasant odour that would not dissipate noisy and dingy ,0
 paper thin walls and ceilings with late night and early morning disturbance when people were moving around one decent night out of five made this london trip one of the most exhausting don t take the mezzanine room looks cosy but its so stale and no proper ventilation in sleeping area ,0

 the beds very comfy but not enough room to move round kept hitting my toes on the bottom of the bed the staff were very helpful especially at breakfast as the big restaurant was closed and there was not enough room for everyone so we had to have our breakfast in the bar and it was not very warm overall we would go back again ,1
 rooms and hallways didnt have enough lighting ,0
 the front desk staff was phenomenal super courteous wonderfully helpful finding directions arranging transportation giving information the bell hops were so professional too we didn t have to lug another suitcase once we arrived at the hotel felt very safe and well taken care of except for the horrible pull out bed mattress ,1
 room was stylish and comfy staff were friendly me and my girlfriend are 18 and staff at places like hotels and restaurants can sometimes be less courteous because of our age but we were treated very nicely we weren t overlooked we felt welcome ,1
 hotel room was really nice we had an executive room with a massive bed which was very comfortable food in the restaurant was very nice just a little expensive ,1
 staff and facilities,0
 it s very dated unclean uncomfortable mattress have to pay for wifi food terrible,0

 had a great time in london we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the thames or an open bus trip the underground and train station are close too we did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces the weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day after each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening hopefully will visit again soon ,1
 the room was so small that i ve never seen such a small room the bed was not for 2 persons the floor was painted concrete the furniture something from old army depot or something like that i find it incredible that this hotel is rated 4 stars it isn t ,0
 rooms absolutely tiny there was not enough room to walk between the bed and the wall on one side and the wardrobe on the other i kept stubbing my toes tiny shower stall room more like a prison cell how this place ever got a 4 star rating beats me,0
 the room was huge and very quiet,1
 bed very comfortable,1
 no light in toilet,0
 air conditioning units right outside the window very loud very little sleep over two nights ,0
 1 window was not sealed properly drafty resulted sleepless night due to coldness as the bed was placed next to the window 2 noisy both inside the hotel and out on the street 3 mouldy under the cupboard ,0
 selected an upgraded room lots of space comfortable and the nespresso machine a nice touch,1
 immaculate central yet peaceful location lovely outdoor seating area ,1
 room poor poky and in an annexe looking out onto rubbish tip very poor value for money ,0
 they put us in a different hotel without the facilities we had booked and expected never got beyond reception so cannot review shaftsbury suites they moved us without giving us an option a supposed upgrade we had booked a club room with a kitchenette as we wanted to do picnics so seemed the perfect solution for our needs the room we were given in different hotel was basic and fridge didn t even work when we told them we weren t happy with accommodation and wanted room in hotel we had booked they had already filled with other people and we were stuck with what we got ,0
 they should be well prepare for big occasion like valentine week end ,0
 everything the hotel room and everything in it was 10000 perfection,1
 location near done darling bars and cafes beautiful woodwork in lobby ,1
 description of hotel is not clear regarding the following there is no parking and they didnt mention that we need to make a reservation in advance comparing with description details of room size its small in real in picture and description they mentioned that there is clear view of eiffel tower which is not actually true there wasnt an employee to help us carry the luggage to my room i would personaly rate it as a 2 stars hotel ,0
 room was spacious clean and comfortable,1
 appalling service 2 rooms not ready by 5 15 pm even though check in was 3 00 pm upstairs bar not available in evening and downstairs bar heaving so no room check in itself took over 20 minutes steam room disgusting the worst council pool facility is better a true disgrace when raised gently with staff they simply said next time i book i should let them know in advance what planet are they from why would i ever book again ,0

 no air conditioner for suite room is very terrible experience and they don t even replace with something to make us comfortable room have old furniture and small room size ,0
 excellent breakfast ,1
 they give us a noisy room superior room like you are sleeping with street life and voices ,0
 the location,1
 first night we stayed on the ground floor and got 5 hours sleep because of the noise of staff at the smoking shelter and a skip being changed at 7 30 am the staff were very rude and not helpful at all with bags and the chafing of room,0
 accessible room brilliant service exceptional location excellent could not fault it staff friendly and helpful ,1

 the room was great and had a view of the train station a beautiful night view we had a great tapas platter in the bar doormen where excellent checkin was fast and easy i requested a late check out the night we checked in the receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour i called in the morning at 8am to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room after that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 a little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible ,1
 the location staff and facilities were great i had a quick and easy time checking in and the robe slippers coffee machine were a great touch,1
 not at all comfortable ,0
 location excellent decor staff excellent however we were in room 105 so small and difficult to even move around disappointing i would think for the price to to expensive for such a small room,1
 excellent location and good value,1
 it is not a four star hotel standard rooms have no space for two people when i complained about that and asked for a change they told me it was impossible even paying a difference theyt are only 14 m sq bathroom seems that of a small boat ,0
 i do not recommend this hotel to others as for what it offers can be found in a better establishment the room was on the lower ground very depressing i could hear next room clients noise it seems the lady loves to scream when the man is no insulation the reception was in the middle of a coffee area very confusing ,0
 room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after 11pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound they gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free 4g internet and free calls over the europe and north america it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in paris staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on it is litterally 5minutes from arc de triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay 10 euro to get on top of it and you can see a paris from there its absolutely beutiful metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about 2euro but it can bring you anywhere really nice location highly recommended ,1

 it needs a top to bottom renovations the room pictures on booking com is not as advertised the rooms are very clumsy worn out carpet and a monitor for a tv i don t think it should be rated because it devaluing the meaning ,0
 great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the earl s court underground station clean quiet breakfast was a good quality and selection nice pillows lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains newly remodeled marble slate bathroom mini fridge in room desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up beautiful garden area i didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area ,1
 staff used lift to move dirty linen no room for occupants rooms not cleaned until late pm and then only beds made very noisy on a weekend,0
 big room nice staff very good location ,1

 car park charge of 50 which we were not aware of there are no signs to tell you that charge exists or that you have to pay at reception staff were very very unhelpful it needs to be made clearer on the websirte and before entering the carpark would never have gone there will not return ,0

 staff were excellent especially the guy who checked us in we flew in to heathrow so the location on the piccadilly line was perfect easy for us to get to from the airport and just as easy to get into london,1
 that feel of luxury that jo public doesn t often experience or can often afford the absolute professionalism of the staff to make your stay as hassle free as possible ab fab ,1
 they robbed me blind of nearly 500 euros,0
 as we were going to the o2 it is right next door and has it s own covered access all the staff reception bars dining room were very helpful and friendly very comfortable made our concert so much more enjoyable ,1
 location and quality of finish,1
 nice staff clean hotel great food around ,1
 free bottled water on very hot day ,1
 staff on front desk the manageress who promised to meet us who sent a trainee instead lack of honesty and care in dealing with people,0
 the room was very spacious and modern bed and pillows very comfy the hotel itself was excellent with a great location right next to the o2,1
 the hotel room was small and not very well appointed the hotel was gloomy and in need of a face lift there were health and safety issues in that the stair carpet on the 6 th floor was fraying and loose trip hazards i have photographs the staff plainly have not had any training in customer relations or of working in a service industry once my daughter and i had booked in no member of staff spoke to us at all not even to say good morning or have you had a pleasant day it was as if we had become invisible having not taken any heed of us as we left and returned to the hotel i cannot imagine what a problem there would have been had there been a fire who is in the building who is not in the building the staff would not have had a clue i used to be a management surveyor and therefore know a lot about safety issues and the power that the health and safety executive possesses neither of the two men at reception on the day we left made a move to help me with my case down the steps i am 71 years old female i suspect they were still reeling after i gave them my views on the hotel it was unfortunate for this hotel that the hotel we had staying the night before was a premier inn which was light bright slick and all the staff were smiling helpful and looked as if they gave a damn what our stay was like and happily their floors did not creak every time we made a move it was more central and also was marginally cheaper the only cheery person i encountered at the commodore was vincy the person who carried our cases to the room for us ,0
 bed was on wheels and kept rolling around the room ,0
 breakfast was terrible overal decor was tired and grimy,0
 the building and it s history ,1
 the staff were very attentive and breakfast was very complete and yummy ,1
 the first night we were allocated a room which were very uncomfortable dirty and outdated when i complained the second morning we were moved to a room in the renovated section room 0818 however find the photos i attached from this room it show how bad the standard is even after renovation also it is impossible to be in the room between 10 00 am and 5 00 pm as a constant thundering drilling and hammering non stop as other sections of the hotel get renovated ,0
 the room was too small we could hardly move around in it it was hot no air conditioning with only a desk fan the ceiling fan was not working this is not anywhere near a 4 star hotel there was no manager on duty wee had to move to a livable place after only one night ,0
 comfortable large hotel room with welcoming and helpful english speaking staff quite good value for paris ,1
 the hotel room was modern location was fantastic and the club lounge facility was well equipped for work and drinks ,1
 comfortable rooms in a very nice building ,1
 breakfast was great and wifi was reliable ,1
 let s start with good things employee are friendly and kind but that should be normal for that kind of hotel so nothing new and wow hotel is clean and it is placed on good location rooms so called deluxe are extremely small bathroom is even smaller toilet is placed inside bathroom and if you have more than 90kg and 1 80cm you are in great problems lights in room are for decoration but greater problem is if you are women and decide to put make up in bathroom lighting doesn t exist a c exist but doesn t work it s not worth money and stars they have,0
 staff extremely friendly,1
 unhrlpfulnstaff breakfast service wws shosking staff cleaned empty tables leaving plates on occupied tables to fester cold coffee coffee machine had no water or beans when we tried go pay cashier asked us to wait and went off to ralk to other staff whrn we were rescued by the manager he waived our charge on hearing our concerns biggest isue poor staff trainjng and cost cutting so not enough staff ,0

 the hotel is very conveniently located to the theatres and covent garden the room was well insulated and the bed was very comfy so much so i slept through a thunder storm ,1
 room was presented well and made to feel welcome,1
 the room was fantastic considering the price we paid the staff were all super friendly we will definitely be staying there again ,1
 eating lots of lovely apples enjoyed having dinner at the hotel and great ambience at breakfast the staff were really amazing and that would make me revisit the facility when i travel to london ,1
 selected the hotel based on its location and hilton tag however was very disappointed with the room and facilities for 356 15 per night charged for the room with breakfast 1 the room was small 2 there was very little storage space 3 the decor was heavy dull and in dark tones 4 the writing desk and chair were worn out 5 only 1 lift for which there is a wait 6 passage from the lift to the room are very narrow 6 no complimentary drinking water offered 7 water in the bathroom tap was hard and unpalatable 8 front desk staff s attitude was far from welcoming toaster in the breakfast section had broken down for 4 days and no one seemed in hurry to repair it overall attitude was take it or leave it i would not choose this hotel again as many better options are available at a lower rates ,0
 breakfast lovely,1
 it is an extremely overpriced facility the room was so small that 2 people at the same time could not stand in the room the space was so limited that we couldn t open the suitcase properly but this was not the worst part the room was not properly cleaned dust everywhere the sheets and duvet were obviously not thorough cleaned plus extra bonus the smell of mould as you entered the room extremely poor facility and sooooo overpriced i wouldn t recommend it to anyone ,0
 no shampoo shower gel on our second day we requested and these were not replaced the access cards to the room were not properly working it is a hassle especially if you arrive at night and just want to rest and you could not get in to the room and have to go down several times to the reception to have the access cards reset ,0
 very comfortable room great location of hotel friendly staff ,1
 friendly staff location ,1
 they gave us an upgrade of the room beautifull sort of attic room complete white very very nice ,1

 the room was very dirty there were stains on the table the carpet there was thick layers of dust behind the headboard there was blood stains on the duvet the bedsheet came off the duvet and was too big this is when we saw the blood and yellow urine looking stains on the duvet disgusting ,0
 i liked nothing in the hotel expect the proximity to the city staff is arrogant food is not continental its not so kids friendly cramped rooms toilet facility is not good i would never ever stay is novotel ,0

 the location and price were excellent ,1
 location,1
 lovely hotel brilliant location for our trip to the o2 arena staff were very helpful when we had an issue with our room being entered by a member of staff when we were half dressed getting ready to go out made to feel extra comfortable after the incident the staff managed brilliantly considering it was there first time if there being a big event at the o2 and having an awful lot of guests for the first time ,1

 the staff were very friendly breakfast was absolutely wonderful so much choice we found the hotel to be in a great location for what we were there for the main area of the hotel is luxurious and the check in was very quick and our bag was brought to our room promptly ,1
 room wasn t great and did like that i had to go on the boat to get the tube all the time,0
 room too small no telephone in the bedroom not working no air conditioning bathroom could be better no lift,0
 the room was so small it was ridiculous how they can sell that as a room and not as a broom cupboard is beyond me ,0
 the location was amazing we weren t too sure how far it would be away from everything considering it was over the river not at all superior location and only a 5 min walk over the bridge amazing hotel for families they are extremely accommodating to kids ,1
 poor service and accommodation would not recommend,0
 reception staff was brilliant the rooms were spotless ,1
 boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms ,1

 breakfast is very poor value for money and the rooms are incredibly small for that price ,0
 the shower didn t work the bath tub didn t drain the night door staff were rude and aggressive and behaved more like nightclub bouncers upon check out i was given the wrong bill truly awful experience ,0
 very small breakfast room causing massive slow queues for breakfast long wait for lifts and house cleaning was poor when they turned up ,0
 this hotel charged 200 pounds to my bank account after checkout without consent authorizing my payment hotel claims these are smoking charges in the room when i don t even smoke in return the hotel is now trying to push me from fighting the charge by claiming they are talking to their lawyers i told them they can t do this since i am not responsible for anything that happens in my room after my checkout if there was an issue they should ve informed me while i was at the hotel instead they debited my card without speaking with me what if i didn t notice this on my statement i have contacted the hotel several times sent three emails to them out of which they have replied to just one email i don t understand how they are dealing with their customers beware i would recommend all other guests to be very careful with the card details they provide to this hotel they are misusing these details i have already taken action from my end but i am really shocked and surprised by their behavior extremely unprofessional ,0

 ambiance and location,1
 the customer service was excellent very attentive,1
 this was a treat for the final 2 nights of our honeymoon room 410 was difficult to get to the lg exit was blocked by dishes from the kitchen the bath and shower were essentially useless and after a 12 hour journey it took 30 minutes to half fill a bath with lukewarm water the mechanism seemed totally impractical the room was good but cramped for two people the kettle area was particularly crowded with items but the fact that there was a kettle was a bonus the air conditioning unit outside the room made sleep very difficult the window was small and needed to be cleaned but in any case little light enters the room as it is feet away from the wall of the next building locating the light switches for corresponding lights was a bit of a project three requests before a second bathrobe came on evening 2 of our stay ,0
 great location for theatre,1
 i found the whole experience very deflating the hotel smells very old and i would give it a 1 or maximum 2 star rating the carpet is worn away and the furniture and upholstery is all extremely old the place smells old the receptionist could not understand anything i was saying ,0
 tired room enamel coming off bath grouting needed renewing hotel paid no attention to details about how special our stay should be for our joint birthdays and tried to move us to a sister hotel which we have stayed in before and loved but specifically wanted this one made husband late for his meeting with an important client whilst arguing with him that as the room wasn t booked in his name he couldn t check in without me told him we then had an upgraded room but we hadn t he has stayed here before and has a far nicer spacious room room aircon not sufficient duvet too hot and had to strip bed down to get to a bearable temp cups in room only big enough for an expresso not tea ,0
 the room size was good very comfy and clean and staff very friendly great location for the apollo and links for getting into central london,1
 this is a large classic hotel interior by the man who did the decorating of the titanic located very close to the tube makes it great for getting around room much larger than most in london right across street from park near british museum ,1
 a small stuffy room which didn t match the description deluxe or the price in our opinion to get to the 2nd bed required a sideways shuffle between the end of the beds and the desk there wasn t room to have the chair at the desk and you couldn t open the mini bar because the door was blocked by the bed the room didn t match the website photographs which show a suitable gap at the end of the bed we paid 40 to have an extra person in the room but there wasn t an extra set of towels extra coffee etc there was one biscuit packet and one chocolate bar between 3 of us which seemed a bit mean especially for a deluxe room luckily we were able to settle who had what amicably we weren t inclined to use the bar lounge so cannot comment on the quality of these areas the receptionist was efficient but unsympathetic her advise was to ask for a larger room on booking not something we would have thought necessary beforehand and we won t be booking again ,0
 receptionist had to sort out a double room although already booked previously then had two single beds pushed together air con wasn t working correctly wouldn t warm the room up no instructions on how to use electrical products within room only one lift working signal reception for television was very poor ,0
 really good location but nice quiet street even though in the centre of london we had a really quiet room all facilities you would expect ,1

 housekeeping would bang on your door to wake you up at 830am this is your alarm very frustrated they will continue banging till you wake up until you told them not to clean up your room in such a morning hours terrible if we need clean up we would put the paper sign out to make up room no respect on guests don t expect this housekeeping will refill your bath gel they only keep those bottles which you don t want to use keep on giving you the same unwanted bottles say conditioner they won t give you slippers cotton pads tho they keep it in their trolley they won t refill your tea sugar when u finished your stay was more than 6 days doubt they changed your bedsheets too in such a long week ,0

 excellent location the hotel has a short cut to the o2 so you can walk there in approx 3 mins also the staff were so helpful and could not do enough for you dinner was brilliant and breakfast had the best choice of fruit and salad and cooked breakfast i have ever seen ,1
 no disable parking available in fact one space was filled with a car covered with a car cover so not moving below carpark had no lighting at night and little room to manoeuvre the room was not at all as described in the photo and lot smaller than expected especially for the price paid will be contacting thistle also lifts too small to fit wheelchair in ,0
 the room we booked through booking com was 377 sq with a king bed the room they gave us was a double size bed and probably 200 square feet we had a very hard time to get a king size bed which we originally booked for we couldn t help but thinking they could cheat on a lot of non english speakers ,0

 i liked the room a lot and the microwave was a nice surprise also having the complimentary room upgrade was nice ,1
 the staff in the reception treat us badly and when i arrived i only get my room ready at 5 00 pm which is very late to rest even they took 300 pounds and still i didn t get refund that because some receptionists took from my cards more money than required that is the worse hotel in london ,0
 location fantastic for apollo shows,1
 staff were rude from start to finish we were checked into our room late after emails months in advance about early check which was great after a 4am flight my wife fell asleep in the lobby she was so exhausted multiple people were checked in ahead of us and all they could say was its not ready no apology or niceties were given my wife and i were both ignored in the bar more than once to the point were we just left horrible experience and we won t be back i wouldn t even give 1 star considering how expensive the room was i have stayed in hostels and had a better experience for 13 pound a night not 110 oh and they also tried to charge us extra for the room claiming that this was their policy even though the price on booking com was final ,0

 small but comfotable room very clean excellent breakfast good location 5 min to underground station ,1
 not conveniently located from the airport or in to central paris it is eother 20 in a taxi to central paris or a 90 min walk the room was unbelievably small and it comfortable for three people in the family room i paid 150 for one night for a family room but it was not comfortable no small luxuries and not ideally located the fire alarm went off early in the morning which disrupted the breakfast routine we were dragged out of the hotel very early because a chef burnt some toast and set the alarm off from then on there was insufficient breakfast on the counter and it took us nearly an hour of waiting for toast and eggs to arrive overall i was very disappointed with the hotel please don t stay here ,0
 the hotel no longer has the swimming pool facility contract with the local spa but this is not reflected in partnered booking site deals this loss of facility did not change the price and nor did it bother the manager that i had specifically chosen a hotel with this facility to find out on the day of arrival with a nonchalant approach that the contract no longer exists i would have chosen a different hotel closer to the centre with a built in pool for less money ,0
 very professionally run hotel the manager ryan was helpful and courteous nothing was too much trouble and went out of his way to accommodate my son and daughter in law who were i ll before arriving a refreshing change for a big hotel chain other staff just as friendly food excellent compliments to the chefs modern exceptional rooms best choice of breakfast food we ve ever seen in a hotel and we ve stopped in some nice hotels ,1
 friendly and helpful staff and excellent location which is very near the metro station ,1
 no air conditioning bed was sunken and lobsifed really hot,0
 had bugs in my room so could not sleep all night,0
 the breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant they were really friendly and always keen to help very close to queensway tube and on the doorstep to hyde park ,1
 almost everything rooms are old small and ugly furthermore it reeked of smoke the room door didn t close tight city noise through the closed window even in 8th floor hotel room was in a labyrinth more than 220 per night for a 1 star hotel would never go to this hotel anymore btw i am hilton honors member ,0
 not well maintained small room and bathroom slightly damp smell ,0
 there s a sailing fan in the room making noise the whole night and the staff could not turn it off so i slept in a room with all the noise the room is not suitable for living yet they need to sort out the fan problems in the morning 7 30am the cleaner began to knock every door no matter u are sleeping or not it was a terrible experience living there ,0
 very friendly staff who we re happy to help ,1
 every thing,0
 rooms were very noisy and the atmosphere was very strange,0
 lovely room very comfortable bed brilliant bar and restaurant and the wait staff were very welcoming and helpful ,1
 ambience close to subway park opposite quiet location,1
 really not worth the money there wasn t a hair dryer in the room and the room was tiny and the bathroom for a couple ended up in a travel lodge,0
 it is really well located and a very nice hotel the facilities are good and bed comfortable and the room pretty quiet for london the restaurant and food were excellent and pretty good value as a lone traveller i felt very safe and comfortable there ,1
 excellent location with many major attractions like london eye big ben parliment houses all at walkable distances ,1
 room was tiny looks a lot bigger in pictures bathroom was like a cupboard and bed was uneven and small like a camper bed,0
 there was a fly in my pasta one staff at the hotel was rude and even wanted to charge us 5 for asking to have a cover to carry our food to our room we later spotted a mouse running round the waiting area the salmon pasta smelt foul the room took ages to clean and we had to ask for sheets to change it ourselves the heater in the room does not work just hated the whole experience in this hotel ,0
 room size was good and kitchen facilities were a great addition for drinks etc great view over london towards the shard and steps from the attractions on the embankment ,1
 cleaness room staff,0
 the room was filthy i had to put towels on the ground to walk on the carpet the bathroom filthy even the basin drain was rusty ,0
 even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably no remediation possible toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests some were empty some partially used checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing service at breakfast was very poor shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done ,0
 the room too small not as photos in booking com toilet so tiny too much cat noise specially in night time,0
 dirtiness the towels were always dirty and they rarely change the bed sheets ,0
 location wifi,1
 most ,0
 staff fantastic went out of their way,1
 location was great,1
 sadly my room wasn t like the photos at all and overall more sad looking than the common areas of the hotel first of all if you are over 5 1 5 meters and assuming all the rooms are the same the shower will not work for you i m 6 and the base of the shower head came at my chin i had to do some cirque du soleil acrobatics to clean my hair this isn t an adjustable sprayer like most places but a fixed showerhead i had a giant sticky spot of goo on the carpeting that housekeeping had clearly ignored for ages it was so gross and wore shoes the entire time after discovering this when my foot was stuck to the floor the blinds were broken and didn t close all the way so the bright morning light streamed in the room itself had very dim lighting and would have benefited from a central bright ceiling fixture the other guests and staff were incredibly loud in the hallways in addition my room was located adjacent to their conservatory event space when the event was over around 11 12 the staff was incredibly loud and clanking and banging what i m assuming were chairs and tables for an hour or so on morning a manager and her staff member decided to have an impromptu meeting at 9 am directly outside my door ,0
 arrived at reception after a hectic day of travelling to be told that as a first time guest i was one of their guests of the day which meant a free upgrade to an executive room and free breakfast as surprises go that s hard to top staff were excellent throughout rooms were splendidly clean and comfortable i d happily come back again ,1
 room and comfy bed,1
 friendly staff perfect location ,1
 unfriendly staff long waiting time for breakfast room service unsatisfying ,0
 the hotel was under construction on arrival i would like to have been made aware of this before hand not a very good experience at hotel de castiglione,0
 cleanness dated furniture wifi is so bad smelly rooms very small bathrooms overrated price ,0
 good location and the free use of a mobile handy with maps underground free int and local calls fantastic ,1
 the room was tiny this is more like a b and b and not a hotel ,0
 what can i say first class service staff are amazing food is amazing loved it will defo go back 5 star service ,1
 room size of an egg cup uncomfortable bed expensive price could have got better for the miney,0
 filthy room broken shower urine on the toilet seat and the room and bathroom smelt of sewage unfriendly staff and mis informed about car parking rude and unpleasant over all ,0
 comfortable beds hotel was nice staff were all friendly,1
 location and friendly staff,1
 kettle did not work properly could not have a shave as socket was broken ,0
 the staff were polite and helpful the room was well appointed and the bed was probably the most comfortable i have slept in it was a good location to get to covent garden and tube stations ,1
 stayed in a family room and shower was leaking i slipped whilst pregnant and hit my head on the stone flooring when i highlighted the leaking shower to a staff member they were fully aware of the leak and said that this was the best room in the hotel to which i responded i d rather have the worst room as long as it s safe this room should not have been booked out especially knowing that children would be walking in and out of the bathroom staff were not friendly at all ,0
 location ,1
 they gave me a room in the attic and when i refused they forced me to pay more than what is in booking website to give me a regular room ,0
 i had a very good stay here with my young children we had a lovely good sized room not small staff are very friendly would recommend this hotel to families ,1
 everything,0
 the staff at park plaza were second to none our group of 3 were celebrating a friends 40th birthday and i had emailed ahead to ask of they could assign us a room with a view studio apartment upon our arrival we were given a lovely welcome our room had a great view of the london eye there was a card for the birthday girl even a happy birthday written on the window the room was clean and a good size for 3 breakfast was lovely plenty of choice friendly staff would thoroughly recommend this hotel did not dissapoint in any way ,1
 under refubishment was not informed by booking com tiny bathroom hallway smelled fusty no bar,0
 despite being a gorgeous hotel with unique history hotel russell remains surprisingly affordable and feels like any luxury hotel should the staff are as helpful and well trained as they are friendly and personable i also appreciated the restaurant and beautiful bar which offered a more well rounded experience vs just a rented room i look forward to coming back throughout the years to come ,1
 the location was great close to major attractions and transport we enjoyed the breakfasts we heard very little noise from waterloo station despite our room overlooking it ,1
 we ordered several room service items including nachos pizza i was violently ill during the night i had serve abdominal pain was throwing up and had diarrhoea my partner was fine and had to spend the night helping me as he never ate the sausages and mash potatoes i am 100 sure that is what gave me the food poisoning even when i was eating it the food looked as if it had been reheated i spoke to the hotel staff in the morning when we checked out after telling them i was ill they still wanted us to pay for the food we ate only when my partner kicked up a fuss did they accept that we should not i told them i wanted to raise a complaint as the food they have served me had made me ill i was called and told that as no one else was ill there was nothing they could do i told them that they had not dealt with my complaint and i wanted a written response from them i still haven t received any written response from the hotel i wanted the hotel to resolve this issue so that i didn t have to write this review it s a shame they never bothered ,0
 room was excellent like your own little flat staff were happy to help,1
 asked for a double bed but instead got two single beds put together with a single bed sheet to hide that one of the best pillows had stain on it the toilet flush made so much noise and went on what seemed like forever the price did not justify the stay was expecting a better stay,0
 the hotel was so beautiful walking in that i was shocked especially at the price we paid the service was that of a 5 star hotel and i was impressed with the lovely welcome we received the staff helped to carry our bags up gave us a snack and helped us choose the best room for our situation ,1
 the stuff wore unprofessional 2017 to pay for your wifi in a hotel in london is unacceptable rooms without a widow and broken telephone and withouttv control ,0
 the sink ,1
 room very small no ventilation what so ever when i spoke to a member of staff he just made excuses not good enough ,0
 great location close to the london eye and southbank easy to get around bus and underground stations were less than 5 minutes away room was spacious and extremely comfortable bathroom was really nice with a bathtub and a shower area kitchenette was well equipped and promptly cleaned by the house keeping staff each day staff was helpful had requested early check in and the room was ready when we arrived free left luggage facilities were available thus we could check out and go around even on the last day when our flight was late at night ,1
 this is better described as a bunch of bedrooms with a reception than a real hotel the public areas consist of a corridor from the reception desk to the bedrooms there is a bar though the staff spend most evenings trying to turf the customers out so they can set it for breakfast complete with cornflake dispensers as early as 10pm when we visited it on our first night at 10 20pm we were advised to sit in the corridor as the bar would be closing soon this despite being full at the time the staff are consistently miserable and the reception staff pay little or no attention to guests you could walk in here from the street and get to the rooms pretty much without acknowledgement or challenge to hide the traffic noise the hotel blares out loud music in the entrance from the street which is very noisy and doesn t give a good impression ,0
 friendly staff comtable beds ,1
 we stayed as a family to do a couple of days sightseeing hotel was in a good area for getting around close to tube and with an underground car park rooms comfy good breakfast and a nice bar ,1
 ants in the room,0
 i booke hotel with free cancellation and to pay at hotel if staying went ahead to stay at hotel was asked for payment on checking in paid in full in cash a few days later i see on my bank statement that they charged my card also for full amount i rang and was told it was a hold on my card not charged that it would be released back to my card i am furious i paid in cash on thursday 24th november its wednesday 29th and still no show of money back in my account they say they don t charge your card but your money isn t available to you as they have hold on it not acceptable at all i use booking com as you have free cancellation on some rooms and pay on checkout i would not recommend you stay at this hotel ,0
 shampoo soap and towels provided for one person when the booking was for double occupancy was asked to go to bar to pay for drinks before we could be served which we found very strange and embarassing especially in fornt of two guests we had the waitress was not firendly or helpfull and she kept repeating that this is the policy in a very unprofessional and non caring attitute ,0
 comfy beds very stylish bathroom,1
 very happy will stay again,1
 facility was so unlike standard regency we accustomed to as we were given the unrenovate room so old only after complained we were given to a new renovate room but the quality was poor would not go back again ,0
 service and support are good,1
 very helpful staff and lovely clean rooms good breakfast ,1
 loved the view from the room and the residents bar,1
 very dirty dust and stains mold everywhere carpet even felt dirty walking on it with shoes shower full with mold nothing as promised no wifi was working for 6 days i was told after asking for 4 times to dont be so so difficult and go sit in the hall with the others no water pressure in the shower burbinh hot or ice cold water was the choice sigarette smell through the whole hotel rude personel i was laufged at when telling the reception that i wanted to swim the swimming pool was not available because of maintenance i was told to swim in the river nearby bad breakfast no working coffee machines 30 for an egg and some canned beans is not really my standard of a proper breakfast bad bed the springs came through the mattress very high price with no value for money ,0
 everything,0
 beds were comfortable room and hotel very clean staff very helpful and polite pool and spa lovely ,1
 whole host of things wrong with this place impossible to find entrance rude and impatient staff i have stayed at a lot of hotels this by the worst will never stay here again what really annoyed me was the fact it says free parking when in fact they charge you 10 a night without mentioning this at all i even asked when checking in yes sir our car park is complimentary to our guests when i was checking out and revising the bill i asked what s this charge for and they said car park even after showing them that they advertise that its free and a member of staff confirmed this the clerk just looked at me and said i don t know why it says that even after talking to the manager expecting this charge to be removed she was even more clueless they did offer me a free nights stay but i declined as mentioned before i will never stay at this hotel or any other holiday inn rip off merchants ,0

 we went for my boyfriends birthday we arrived a bit earlier than in check time but our room was already set up as it was my boyfriends birthday they gave him a complimentary slice of cake which was lovely superb location very friendly staff ,1
 this hotel is not 4 star it needs refurbishment the mattress had been repaired and was very bouncy it should have been replaced the headboard was damaged mirror light didn t work in the bathroom and the shower was dirty ok for a nights sleep but should be classified as a two star ,0

 loved the location and the style of the hotel,1
 the service was really slow we asked 3 times for an adapter and when it finally came the hotel charged us for it even though we left it there the cups of coffee in the morning are really tiny as well as the quantity of the food it s not at all a meal worth 35euros ,0
 location for the bercy stadium and the village is great,1
 i stayed for 17 nights and they clean my room just 5 times only the staff is not friendly except 2 only when i was spoke to them frome my room and asked them for room service to clean room they closed the phone they don t have respect for the guests and i make check out before i finish my period that i booked because i really don t like staying there ,0

 the electricity control system broke down 2 times the first time all the lights are off and the second time happened in the morning at 4 the lights can not be closed so angry bad sleep ,0
 excellent location and a great room with london eye view ,1
 the d cor was drab and grubby the photo s on the website must have been taken 10 years ago the aircon didn t work in the room which left a small radiator for the only source of heat the cleaners left the window open so on return the room was freezing the breakfast was of average the bacon and sausages were obviously a very cheap brand the eggs only offered scrambled were like rubber all in all a very disappointing stay i will not be returning ,0
 size of the room was far far too small barely room for suit cases room was too warm air con wasn t sufficient ,0
 the room was too small even i upgraded to double delux as i did not like the room located at the basement 1 level the lounge was not confortable i stayed at a hotel in birmingham and liverpool found the room were much larger and price were much lower perhaps they are not in london ,0
 bedrooms were very small not ideal if you are claustrophobic ,0
 the bed was soooo comfortable we want to know where we can buy one apart from that everything was great all round excellent ,1
 overpriced hotel with only basic facilities there was no mini refrigerator in my room after two days of reminding the staff to provide one i got one that was faulty internet in room was also really poor tv remote was faulty double room is extremely small comparable to a budget hotel manager was really unfriendly and uncooperative ,0
 there was bed bugs in our room they changed our room for the one just next door to it they didn t think to offer any kind of compensation even though we have spent four nights in the establishment ,0
 it is the worst hotel house that i have ever been very bad neighborhood,0
 quiet room comfortable bed and good wifi,1
 the hotel has gone down the pan the bed was the worst i ve ever slept on you could feel the springs through the mateess,0
 the whole building is tatty and tired the carpets are tapes down in reception lifts are rattled and all the woodwork is scraped back down to wood windows are filthy and the odd shapes room quirky but not in a good way tv on room 1100 is placed on an angles wall and the tv so small for the distance you need binoculars as for the pizzeria thick base and not cooked all the way though really disappointed they do have a spa but did not try this so i am unable to comment ,0
 the decor was very impressive throughout staff were helpful and friendly all was clean ,1
 no restaurant facilities to speak of room sooo small not good value for money ,0
 smile of the hotel is very bad and the room is not clean ,0
 loved location room was a grate size,1
 food at restaurant was simply awesome for an indian traveller the breakfast was superb complimentary mobile for the stay with free calling facility is great idea,1
 rude staff locked mini fridge because we didn t have a credit card 5 tray charge overpriced food a kit kat was 4 50 2 staff members walked into our room without knocking one walked in when my daughter was in her underwear ,0
 customer service wasn t good the price doesn t justify the facilities ,0
 elevator noise all night long hairs in bath tub on arrival ,0
 the room is very small and dark,0
 we were put in a basement room could here the underground and people moving around above us felt very much like being in box ,0
 impossible not to like this hotel great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in we also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices the staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail we were initially booked into room 1024 which faces onto the westminster plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them to be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms we decided on a junior suite room 1027 which looked out on big ben county hall and the eye it did cost 20 more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive ,1
 comfortable,1
 hotel used a bate and switch tactic internet site showed modern light rooms actual were dark and traditional and in poor repair cracked sink bath very small hotel was worn and dirty feeling front desk staff was not helpful in getting early entrance to a room that was supposedly unoccupied since 8 39 am not given until 12 30,0
 after two hours from checking out i noticed that i left one of my shirts in wardrobe took my way to the hotel straight away guess what my shirt was gone what am i supposed to say now i should ve sued the hotel seriously unfortunately i dont have enough time to deal with it such a ridiculous experience ,0
 rooms are very small there is a small table and chair and i would like to know how to get to that chair i was in room 002 ,0
 i stayed at this hotel 4 times over the last 4 years this last few weeks being the fourth time i kept going back because of its location this last stay was in august 2016 all the others were feb march april and i saw a major major difference in staff friendliness room readiness and service my stay in august was horrible to say the least we moved our rooms 3 times in the first day and a half because the ac didn t work the taps didn t work there was no hot water and mainly because i had requested 2 connected rooms and upon arrival there were non available so we had to wait for a room to free up and even when we settled in a room we had to replace the blow dryers because they were not working and the kettles twice because they leaked the people who cleaned the room and the porters who carried the bags were very friendly the reception staff was not friendly neither were some of the concierge staff they didn t want to make much effort to help with requests i left knowing i would never return to this hotel again they blamed booking com for issues related to payment at checkout and for connected room request i would not advise anyone to go in the summer months ,0
 location is great close to 2 tube stations lobby public areas lovely old world feel but rooms spacious very clean all requests followed up quickly with smiles beds very comfortable with a choice of pillows ,1
 ridiculous small shower,0
 very clean compfy bed very quiet although in the middle of london,1
 staff were fantastic location is brilliant nice touches for our birthday boy which was appreciated complimentary drinks voucher whilst waiting for our room was very much appreciated,1
 the room was clean the beds were comfortable and the room offers everything that you need the view from the room was fantastic and the access to the 02 arena was very handy ,1
 facilities in the room were great even down to the iron ,1
 the staff were all so helpful and very nice they all made us feel extremely welcome and were very attentive they also put a card with some chocolates and fruit in our room as it was my partners birthday something i had only mentioned over email beforehand when trying to find a restaurant for the evening of our stay this was a lovely touch the hotel its self is beautiful and in a great location right next to hyde park a short 3 minute walk to queensway tube station and a 6 or 7 minute walk to bayswater tube station so very easily accessible it also only takes around 10 15 minutes to get to the hotel from euston bonus the value for money is great ,1
 this is a great hotel it s ideally situated as it s walking distance from kings cross st pancras and russell square surrounded by great places to see and restaurants extremely comfortable rooms and great customer service ,1
 there was a terrible noise all throughout the night sounded like there were pipes rattling really loud every time i opened the bathroom door i could hear next door as thought they were in the room with us the hotel charged me a 91 retainer prior to arrival which i still havent been refunded ,0
 the room turned out smaller than i expected but i didn t dwell on this fact because i did book the room online and the images could be deceiving what my main issue is and what left me utterly speechless was the lack of trustworthy staff this hotel employed i left my ring in my room s table i put it in the same spot every night and when i remembered after coming back to the hotel it disappeared i decided to not assume the worst and looked everywhere but there was no sign of it so i decided to speak to the reception and ask for their help to check which members of staff entered cleaned the room the response which left me utterly shocked was when i asked them to check cctv and they replied that they would but that s assuming someone from outside the hotel somehow entered my room and took the ring they didn t want to question any of their staff at least the ones who entered the room because they wanted to give their own employees the benefit of the doubt i understand that employers must protect their employees but what if that compromises the customers experience my primary issue was the ring that was stolen which has a lot of sentimental value linked to it but it s certainly a matter of trust now you d expect the hotel to contact you even if they didn t find the ring and the issue they claimed to look into but guess what no one has contacted me ever since it s been a month even to apologise i m writing this review not to express my anger only but to warn other customers from a hotel which clearly has their customers at the bottom of their priority list ,0
 itchy bed sheets weird bugs in bathroom tiny room it was supposedly a club room ,0
 breakfast was good tv services excellent,1
 it seemed the only way to access the free wifi was to signup to the hhonors scheme not acceptable ,0
 staff food easy checkin and out perfect room close to everything,1
 staff behaviour and the way they dealt with customers ,0
 good central location ,1
 loved the curtains as it made the room extra dark clean and a good size ,1
 room too small darkness high price,0
 this was not a 5 star hotel by any means they do not have a concierge they do not have a lobby only a hallway with a desk they do not clean your room unless you ask they do not give you shampoo and conditioner unless you ask they do not have irons in the rooms they do not have luggage racks in the rooms these are all staples of a 5 star hotel which they claim to be on top of all of that they have construction going on the hotel was not remotely close to being full and they wanted to put us directly over the construction we had to ask to be someplace higher above it and the best they could do is move us up to two floors above the construction this is not a 5 star hotel experience stay away ,0
 friendly staff and very helpful,1
 a lot,0
 i loved everything ,1
 staff were very welcoming and attentive from the outset and for the duration of our stay the room was superb clean and extremely comfortable this was the perfect location in which to stay to ensure our overall o2 experience was memorable,1
 it was in the right place for our concert at o2,1
 responsive staff excellent room terrific breakfast and located conveniently to tube a bit pricey but service food and comfort all exceptional ,1
 everything about the hotel and staff we re rude the staff couldn t understand english the bathroom in our room had cracked floor tiles the room needed painting and maintenance work carrying out the mini fridge was empty we asked for it to be filled up and they reception refused loved london hated the hotel ,0
 superb staff who make you feel at home hotel ambience and decor also make it feel like home,1
 location close to some shops and restaurants only 3 minutes walk underground 4 minutes walk polite and assistive staff room space is good,1
 room service was very poor for a bottle of water we were asked to wait for 20 mints room was very small with window facing the roof of the mall room which was given to us was miles away from elevator with a baby and no porter service it was a bad from the hotel not to think about us,0
 two twins out together to make big bed food was cold ,0
 we had a corner room on the 11th floor with two large windows spectacular views of big ben palace of westminster the london eye and the city skyline over the waterloo train station this location is awesome to go to all the southbank attractions restaurants waterloo train underground station westminster bridge and longer walks along the thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after 9 30 pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of pimm s at the southbank centre almost every night the room was spacious especially for a hotel in london and the bed was large and comfy this is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat the staff were super friendly and very helpful we didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel ,1
 room needs decorating,0
 the front desk staff julie was arrogant and unprofessional the room was jaded basin and toilet seat were all scratched no fridge a horrible hotel to stay ,0
 perfect location friendly staff,1
 only location was good the rest were really bad they think that they are inevitable because of the location and that is why they don t spent effort on us,0
 nothing and this is the last time i will be in this hotel,0
 absolutely disgusting hair in bathtub mould extremely dim light cold filthy carpet hair and something that looked like a dead mouse under duvet not a 4 star hotel not even 1 ,0
 the great variety of food at the breakfast bar help offered by all the staff,1
 heated floor in the shower,1
 bedding had holes in it most of the plug sockets didn t work the window couldn t be opened at all as one of the ropes was broken and hanging off and the shower sprayed the whole room also we were looking forward to using the rooftop bar after our show but were very disappointed to be told it shuts very early so didn t get a chance i have stayed in much cheaper hotels in london that offered a lot more very disappointed ,0
 great breakfast,1
 the view was breathtaking and the proximity to the o2 couldn t be better,1
 the helpfulness of the reception staff,1
 loud poor service,0
 good location close to train station warm welcoming staff concierge were very obliging and quick to assist with luggage to room and storing luggage on checkout ,1
 carpets were stained everything was a little dirty queen bed was 2 little ones side by side shower head was really low ,0
 staff amazingly friendly assisted a lot and dealt with our complaint about drilling on beside us ,1
 the rooms were filthy stains all over the floor paint coming off the bottom of the doors i stay with this chain of hotels all the time as ive never been disapointed i will be taking this further ,0
 room size bathroom ok complimentary breakfast as result of room change location very good quick access to lancaster gate and paddington tube stations ,1
 even though there was a minor inconvenience on our arrival the staff went above and beyond in trying to accommodate us compliments to all staff they were courteous always willing to help with a smile on their faces and alston at the front desk deserves a thumbs up for his professional treatment and kindness i will recommend this hotel to family and friends i felt like i was in old london which was very special thanks to all the staff ,1
 we generally loved this hotel we d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in bloomsbury before so we thought we d try staying there the location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from heathrow was do able the hotel s victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room the staff was very helpful ,1
 the reception staff is not at all courteous after paying so much they need extra money for everything we asked for good view room they need extra money for it we asked for late check out they need extra money for it the hotel does not have a lobby for spending some time you sit in the caf and they want that we should order something so that they get money the rooms are so small i will not recommend this hotel to anybody ,0
 we had breakfast but the reception didnt tell us so we missed breakfast easily without any indication by reception but we paid ,0
 i was billed for wifi that didn t work the staff dealt with this poorly by arguing with me in an accusatory and aggressive manner then proceeded to charge me ,0
 friendly and helpfull staff good breakfast,1
 the furniture old and broke the bath is old and small,0
 the staff were friendly the room was clean and the bathroom was clean too the breakfast was really good but the restaurant size compared to the number if guests was quite small and everyone was packed to each other ,1
 paid for a king room the curtain in the shower was broken and the water would not drain could not sleep the floor was squeaking as people were walking and talking in the room above the continental breakfast was really basic much more basic than at premier inn i asked a receptionist to book a cab that accepts credit cards but the driver said he did not it was not something really bad but i would not stay here again ,0
 nice location and cheerful staff,1
 clean friendly staff and great free wi fi ,1
 no disturbance from other rooms or the corridors good size room and bathroom friendly staff,1
 friendly staff quiet location ,1
 area out of no where damp smell dated decoration etc,0
 extremely noisy room could hear the street traffic was given a smokers room smelly and noisy could not sleep at night ,0
 the breakfast was of poor quality the hot food was over cooked and tasted bland we didn t have breakfast there the second day only 2 of the 3 lifts were working and it took 15 20 mins to get back to the room after checking in bed was uncomfortable this is not a 4 star hotel ,0
 location was perfect ,1
 shower had mould and cleaner knocked the door at 07 50 to clean the room and woke me up,0
 great location excellent breakfast,1
 every thing the service is so bad and poor and the breakfast also so bad the room is so bad very old furnuture,0
 reasonable for central london,1
 our stay at the grand royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room the staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options we loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too we were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit london we highly recommend the grand royale ,1
 cleanliness location,1
 on arrival we were told there were no non smoking double rooms left after waiting 50 minutes we were then told that they found one no heating in the room after 2 phone calls to reception and a wait of 1 hour portable radiator delivered to room at 1 00 am two hone calls to room at 05 30 am and 05 40 am for a pizza delivery which we had not ordered overall very dissatisfied with the whole experience and on informing the hotel manager about this we were very flippantly told nothing could be done about it as it was sunday and the management team were not available ,0
 the bed the shower the room the price,0
 central location friendly staff,1
 worst hotel i have ever stayed,0
 i loved the hotel design and decoration staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling that is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip breakfast was way better than i expected although coffee was quite bad that is something most hotels fail to nail and i think most guests find it important rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable ,1
 on first morning of our stay when i ordered my breakfast i got phone call from the restaurant manager asking me why do i need so much of food confirmed with her that i need everything that i ordered and after 10 minutes got another call from the cheif about the same thing i was asked so many questions about my breakfast that i had to cancel the order very disappointing no one got the right to ask a customer why want to eat certain things or quantity poor and disappointing,0
 we arrived after midnight after a show in hoxton and were told that again there was no disabled car parking available and no standard spaces either the hotel policy is they won t allow guests to pre book their 20 a night parking so it s pot luck if you can park when you arrive how ludicrous the receptionist was very kind and said he would find us a space when we entered the secure car park there were at least twenty empty spaces unexplainable so we went to the bar that is open til 2am to get a coffee and we re told the coffee machine was turned off even though the bar was open for another 95 minutes disappointed we had two double rooms booked and paid for for my wife and i and also our friends our room was freezing cold when we opened the door i turned the heating on full and temperature set to 30 degrees after an hour of freezing cold air blowing round the room we decided to turn it off by this time it was 2am and i thought it no point telling reception as we didn t fancy having maintenance men in our room so early in the morning we were tired and just went to bed for a few hours fully clothed after trying to warm up with the hairdryer we could t sleep properly and we re glad when morning came so we could leave the room i am a disabled man with a chest condition and have now picked up a cold from the freezing inhabitable conditions in the room i told reception in the morning and they said i should have told maintenance at 2am and that was the end of it also when we checked out we noticed there was hardly a car in the car park so why pretend the car park was full to capacity at 12 30 in the morning thoroughly disappointed after our fifth or sixth stay at the re hotel we won t be staying again they re just not bothered with having happy customers so they won t be having any more of our money avoid like the plague unless you like a challenge ,0
 very clean room,1
 room very quiet and bed very comfy temperature control in room very good ,1
 the appearance of the hotel was beautiful and every single member of staff was delightful hotel bar was very relaxing and our room size was perfect ,1
 clean spacious room awesome bathroom great location will definitely go there again ,1
 we really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel with beautiful character from the outside of the building to the reception lobby area theatre lounge bar dining room which all reflected the timeless elegance of this 1800 s building which was once the residence of lilly langtry the staff were super friendly helpful the location was perfect for us being close to tube stations making getting around so easy also being so close to hyde park kensington gardens was good too making a stroll in nice surrounding effortless nearby to the hotel there s a great selection of restaurants offering avarious worldwide cuisines a tesco express a sainbury s both being 2 minute walk away was handy too all in all a great stay in london with everything we needed at our fingertips feet we would stay here again ,1
 staff at breakfast resturant,0
 staff were amazing rooms imaculate and spa facilities great rooms very quiet too perfect it s pricey but worth it if you want to feel like treating yourself great cocktails on 18 and lovely food on 2 ,1
 i liked the small kitchenette in the room especially useful if you travel with children ,1
 there was no central heating on in my room this was in december i complained to reception and a heater was eventually delivered the room never heated up properly over the 2 days i was bitterly disappointed ,0
 dirty smelly room had no window bed at 30 cm from bathroom door so that one could only open half of it and had to squeeze through to go in bathroom new and clean but that is about the only good thing that one can say about the hotel definitely not worth the money ,0
 very comfort bed and pillows ,1
 this hotel is in a nice location very near to the metro station hotel is clean and the staff is nice too the price paid for this hotel was worth i highly recommend it ,1
 booking not carried through as the hotel decided the price was too low lack of communication from the hotel not even an apology ,0
 thanks all i liked how professional your staff were especially sna ya and alex thanks,1
 rude staff,0
 great location attractive decor in room ,1
 superior double room was small unremarkable and worst of all was on a significant slant not flat so you felt sea sick and disorientated first night slept poorly due to a constant bright red light and loud humming noise over bed staff turned it off for the second night which was great but then we recieved a 6 o clock wake up call this was a mistake and was absolutely not requested above irritating me it was completely unprofessional so therefore i experienced poor sleep on both nights very very expensive even for central london and nothing to justify it breakfast extortionate but thankfully endless places to eat within walking distance staff were pleasant but will never book here again ,0
 the suite excellent very clean staff excellent ,1
 after a long and difficult journey being told i was customer of the day and given an upgrade to a great room with a view across to central london was wonderful even without that this seemed good value compared to many other hotels i ve stayed in in london clean and crisp well furnished room comfy bed great staff and a good breakfast thank you ,1

 the location and our bed,1
 location and view from the bedroom window ,1
 the room was not well cleaned we had tea stains and chocolate on the menus and dirty towels left in the room also we are very unhappy that we were not informed of the building work after requesting to be away from the building work we were placed in a room with an industrial workers lift directly outside the window making our stay very uncomfortable ,0
 no service attitude staff not friendly ,0
 the location is fantastic for exploring the south bank and walking along the river the room was on the 13th floor so had amazing views of the london eye comfortable bed overlooking the views of london ,1

 4 knocks in the morning form 7 45 to 10 30 by house keeping when check out is at 11 twin beds pushed together to make a double bed which is extremely uncomfortable bed located under a dusty air vent so woke up with a cold reception also questioned a booking for a double room because it was 2 females checking in and the situation was rude and extremely awkward ,0

 the historic building,1
 fantastic building like staying in a little museum friendly helpful staff i liked the handy device in the room and the fact they had a spare plug converter for me ,1
 unclean carpets on 5th floor corridor unclean kettle unclean carpet noisy staff showing new guests rooms at 1 and 2 am noisy lift filthy curtains no option to check door locked from inside couldn t leave windows open as you could get in from another room along roof single solo men on sofas with no apparent reason not reading or waiting in reception made us feel uncomfortabe on arrival reception area dark and crumbs etc all over the carpet scruffy,0
 the fact that i had prearranged a late check out the following day and receiving a phone call to the room half an hour before our departure time is not a good advert for rushing people out ,0
 lovely room and good food service and staff excellent breakfast was lovely and waiting time at reception short benefits of a smaller and more intimate hotel ,1
 they actually stole money from us from a mistake on the booking they lied to us they told us that if booking com is okay with reinbursing us the money or changing dates they will refund us or allow us to change date booking com said okay but then the hotel refused well i guess we can call that pretty much a lie and stealing ,0
 breakfast not worth the daily price rooms dark and not well appointed staff clueless complicated hotel in which to get around no cnn no value for money cabbie could not find as hotel marketed as london city suites yet official name is montcalm at the brewery,0
 we had just one night in london and the hotel s location let us make the most of it took the tube directly from heathrow no transfers and found the hotel right around the corner from the russell square tube station the next day it was an easy walk to st pancras station to catch the train to gatwick we spent our day in london eating shopping and visiting the british museum everything within extremely easy walking distance grand old hotel with updated comfortable rooms and magnificent public spaces it occupies nearly a block and the hallways are quite long and could probably be updated but the rooms are very pleasant indeed stayed on a sunday night when the room rates were exceptionally low they re much higher the rest of the week charming doorman too ,1
 good location and quiet at night,1
 the rooms furnishings and general state of the hotel were all very tired and old fashioned horrible scratchy toilet paper ,0
 the receptionist,0

 this was one of our favourite hotels in london as you can see from our earlier reviews through the years but sadly all gone down hill the young lady at reception was miserable even when we asked for a smile she grimaced room 520 filthy when i moved the small minibar which made so much noise we had to unplug has never been cleaned there since opening asked for a double bed got 2 singles no slippers or bathrobe or breakfast for 440 euro a night get real ,0
 excellent breakfast compact but comfortable room ,1
 great location friendly and helpful staff ,1
 the heater didnt work the room was very small and the location was horrible from canary wharf i had to take a taxi which cost 20 ,0
 it was a joining room which we were not aware of traumatized when we opened it thinking it was a cupboard to find two elderly people asleep the sheets where unclean with stains and hair the only thing i can t complain about is the location and the nice man who checked us in however not the lady who checked us out it wasn t worth 200 for the night ,0
 the restaurant on g f did not accept walk in customers at about 15 minutes before the formal closing time and we were forced to go out to find another restaurant in the area ,0
 comfy bed,1
 the price if i had not paid for the room and was a visitor i would of thought i was in a travel inn or travel lodge i get the location but 170 is a complete rip off as far as i m concerned i felt robbed the bathroom was exactly the same as a travel lodge for that kind of money i expect a decent bath a shower cubicle something a little luxurious for gods sake my partner purchased the full english breakfast and for 22 it was worse that stopping at a motorway services i would appreciate a refund but i know this will never happen i suppose i can add my negative feedback onto trip adviser and a few various hotel recommendation sites and hope someone see s and does not experience what i did for such an extortionate sum of money completely mis sold and completely ripped off ,0
 staff on check in were rude i had booked a twin room by accident and asked if they could change it to a double without even looking at the system she said there was no double rooms left then when i asked again and asked if she would check after speaking to her manager there was miracously a double room available room was dusty with stains all over the bedsheets plugs were broken drainage in the bathroom stunk room service kept us waiting for an hour for 2 plates and cutlery when the guy came he only brought a fork and knife no plates when we told him we had asked for plates he said he would come back to no surprise we never seen him again we got an upgrade for our last 2nights lovely view but the room had a connecting door to the room next door which you could open which meant we did not feel safe leaving our possesions in there we got woke up at 8am by the child next door screaming for his mum will not be stopping at this hotel again all though they tried to make our stay better with a free room upgrade it was still very poor especially as we was there to celebrate my 30th birthday and the prices they charge per night ,0
 great location for the o2 really comfortable bedrooms especially the beds staff are fantastic breakfast was incredible and vast will definitely stay again ,1
 very convenient to piccadilly line tube at russel square british museum and university grand public rooms of a previous era,1
 the hotel is old but charming and the staff very accomodating lovely bar the location is great tube next door but one can easily walk to to many of the main attactions ,1

 staff were excellent balcony room was amazing and loved the extra club lounge offerings,1
 location size of the room,1
 in a perfect location in the middle of london but blocked off all the noise a really peace of beauty hidden away would recommended to anyone ,1
 beware of rooms as there is a rail line behind the hotel trains do not stop until 1 30 am and start again at 5 am ,0
 we arrived at 3pm i e one whole hour after the recommended time we were informed that our room was not ready and that if we wanted to be allocated a room we would have to pay for an upgrade eventually the receptionist allocated a upgraded room at no extra cost when we entered the room it was clear that maintenance had failed to replace the shower door and that the shower had not been secured to the wall ,0
 are beds,0
 lovely clean room and really liked the ease of getting to the o2 arena for my gig hotel was very clean and modern,1
 a really lovely hotel close to the london eye room facilities were excellent and loved the fsmily room layout with beds on either side of the room and small kitchen with tea making facilties sink and micro perfect if travelling with a baby etc iron and board was brilliant extra too loved the mini fridge bed was king size and very comfy we were located on the road side of the hotel but didn t hear a any traffic noise overall a lovely hotel with nice helpfull staff and would recommend a stay here to anyone,1
 small rooms marks on walls and they didn t change the bin from the people staying there before us staff were rude i had to ask 3 times for an iron,0
 location was helpful cleanliness was average reception was nice ,1
 very outdated tiny bathroom very hard to move around very old guy furniture,0
 staff at breakfast grumpy badly organised had to go for my own cutlery come on guy s basics room was very small noisy plumbing meant i heard every time someone went to the toilet or had a shower worst london stay ever ,0
 the bed was extremely small for 2 people bathroom looked good but was very uncomfortable the sink was way too high felt like it was installed by mistake in wrong place a lot of space but no place where to put accessories coffee machine is hard to use because of nuts and other minibar things standing in front of it i also found several things which didn t work properly in my room i was asking myself why i should call reception to tell about all the things which didn t work in my room as if it s my job spa was small and not all equipment worked window in the room was very small don t expect to see the sun or the sky ,0
 free coffee on arrival was a very nice touch lovely wood panelled public rooms giving a nice comfortable old fashioned club atmosphere our room was cosy but contemporary and very comfortable being lower ground floor this was expected and reflected in the price ,1
 not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on park lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special upon arrival i mentioned that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele i was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like vip s you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again ,1
 good quality breakfast good sized studio room for family friendly staff clean room clean hotel close to tube and all south bank amenities ,1
 absolutely brilliant hotel me and my fiancee booked 2 nights stay for our anniversary to watch lion king we were upgraded as soon as we arrived great hotel tucked away would 100 recommend to anyone ,1
 excellent location nice bar great staff ,1
 location was very central but rooms very quiet reception very friendly efficient and helpful bags were taken to rooms discounted breakfast offered in addition to room only we had booked facilities described map of london given and named member of staff provided as contact during our stay over the weekend bar staff and housekeeping staff were equally good excellent personal service our best hotel stay in london for a decade ,1
 staff is badly organized value for money is poor a design hotel with cheap furniture night side table wheel broke of lighting concept is inadequate only one lift worked during our stay we were on the 5th floor the halloween party in the lobby was a disaster we waited to order a drink for halve an hour since it took the bar tender about 30 minutes for two drinks he was also all alone to serve the entire bar when we finally could order they didn t have mint to make mochitos we pointed out to them that there was mint but then they didn t have knives to cut the limes so again we waited for 15 minutes in between a waitress took an order for a cuba libre but it never was served the bar was messy and the staff clearly totally overburdened this hotel is way too expensive for what they have to offer ,0
 i have been upgraded for free nice tv set all ok,1
 awful d cor lots of noise from the street,0
 the bed was excellent as was the italian restaurant ,1
 ageing hotel rooms and poor executive lounge,0
 the location,1
 dirty room dirty bathroom slow elevators,0
 doorman were fantastic staff were friendly room was comfy warm and quiet enjoyed our stay only wish it was longer ,1
 very pleasant staff hotel in good location with all the facilities we required,1
 i was given a room in the basement that s right at the rate of nearly 200 pounds a night i had basically no windows the only window was facing a wall a few feet away was next to the gym and had to listen to people walking up and down the hallway all night likely employees of the hotel who were obviously working on top of that i woke up to the smell of breakfast food in my room while i love breakfast the smell was so strong and pervasive that i couldn t enjoy it and grew increasingly frustrated for the absence of fresh odorless air ,0
 fabulous hotel highly recommended staff were extremely helpful upon check in a fantastic view when entering the room on to the o2 arena peaceful night sleep pillows were very comfortable breakfast was exceptional no faults will definitely be returning ,1
 gorgeous suite the bathroom was really fab soft fluffy towels a really comfy bed nice to have a coffee machine in room too location is excellent for events at o2,1
 we were not given the room we had been promised and were then lied to about type of room and taken for a ride took 3 days of complaining finally to be charged the correct rate after much lying on their part a total disgrace,0
 could not get any sleep the whole night too much noise it was devastating i would like some sort of compensation from this hotel spoke to the reception team no one contacted me ,0
 the room was beautiful and the bed was very comfy ,1
 bathroom larger and room,0
 my upgrade to a bigger room had 3 single portable beds all with remarkably uncomfortable mattresses breakfast was appalling the cheapest of ingredients and served tepid staff in bar rudely challenged me carrying 2 pints 10 yards from the counter to my table until i produced my room id never experienced anything like it ,0
 every things not good at all,0
 internet doesn t work,0
 i ve stayed here quite a number of times the hotel is presently in an upgrade process so there is some disruption at present despite this the staff are helpful and attentive as usual the place is spotless you would hardly know the builders are in and the new rooms are very nice i am sure the long term result will be great the bed was very comfortable and the room well lit not dark and dull like so many places with mood lighting bad mood the hotel is in a relatively quiet site and there is little internal noise but it is about 15 mins walk to any underground station ,1
 cost and location air conditioning excellent ,1
 everything s is too bad only location was good,0
 the hotel is old and so dirty the rude lady at the reception said that the room is cleaned every 2 days they just empty the trash bin everyday is that really a 4 star hotel the cleaning staff do not work at all it was a horrible stay ,0
 the elevator was out of order and it was so difficult for me and my wife who has knees pain to climb the stairs to the 3rd floor twice and me 4 times the staff response looked like take it or leave it very bad experience ,0
 the neighborhood is terrible my mistake i didn t pay more attention to the location when booking even the taxi driver who drove us from the airport to the hotel warned us not go out at night at some times it left like in africa streets and nearby metro station filthy garbage everywhere ,0
 staff were great and the lobby area and bar were great,1
 strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast poor quality of food especially bread we had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set ,0
 children made to feel welcome,1
 the room overlooked other rooms in the hotel despite being the high cost river view option no bedside clock there was one screwed down so i wouldn t steal it but i couldn t see it during the night the lighting system is pathetic and i resorted to removing the card to turn the lights off which meant no air con ,0
 great breakfast very high end for europe standards wonderful experience overall ,1
 i have stayed at some top hotels in england but i have never stayed in a hotel where there were always 4 staff on reception there was never a queue to check in out or to have questions answered great all round hotel,1
 the breakfast was great the service was amazing and room was perfect for us ,1
 on arrival receptionist wasn t too friendly maintenance people were working as there was some work in the hotel understandable but guests should be informed we asked if we could upgrade the room answer straight away no didn t make any effort to check or ask why when got to the room bathroom wasn t cleaned properly spits on the mirrors didn t give clean feeling small room no extra pillows for 4 hotel very dissapointing wouldn t go back no either recommend to anyone ,0
 the whole experience was extremely poor i had to change rooms twice because they got the room type wrong in the first room then the second room door would not lock and the final room was just very worn down the staff were nonchalant to this fact that was extremely frustrating i was given a run down iron and ironing board that i couldn t use because it was just rotten i went for food in the roba restaurant i think that s the name and it was terrible and the cutlery and serving plates were filthy so i couldn t even eat my food which was all frozen by the way i had garlic bread and fries as a snack but cancelled the main i genuinely wouldn t recommend this place if you intend to feel comfortable or you are used to high quality hotels ,0
 the sign to my room says mind the step it should say mind the steps because i went down seven steps also the shower cubicle is very small i couldnot bend to clean feet very narrow indeed ,0
 it is closed to city center and room is big enough near metro 14 line ,1
 great location near paddington very friendly staff good simple breakfast excellent value for the price ,1
 staff is not friendly rooms are too small talking about breakfast is waste of time i have never seen such small hotel rooms in my life ,0
 staff is terrible especially concierge piere luc always makes mistakes when ordering any enterntainment ,0

 room was like a cupboard overlooking the bins one of the beds falling apart ,0
 smoke detector alarm in 7 30 in the morning,0

 my deposit hasn t released till now,0
 bed very poor old style unlike the sweet bed of another chain hard old mattress and horrible cloying duvet linen felt as though it had been around a while washed sheets and towels but worn hand towel had a big hole in it lift extremely tiny creates a claustrophobic feel to the whole place i had to ask to get air con for cooling a stuffy room for some reason the staff had switched it off time for this hotel to enter the expectations of 21st century ,0
 pubic hair in sink faeces in toilet carpet filthy stained furniture broken skirting board bathroom fan has no isolator and stays on all night complaints not acted upon,0
 noise from hallway backyard bathroom was insanely cold the tiles on the floor was very very cold we had to have the shower running to heat up the bathroom we think the windows where poorly isolated and the cold from outside had a free pass inside the staff where not helpful with finding another room for us ,0
 the hotel is a beautiful old house that has kept the atmosphere of old times ,1
 too hot in room stuffy and difficult to sleep with bright lights on controls will make sense if you stay there ,0
 their attitude awful in dealing with customers specially their management they should be more respectful in a way they talks the hotel is too expensive compare to the size of the room there is no space for a suit case the toilet is small narrow the elevator in the hotel is too small only for one person has space not advisable at all 0 score deserves ,0
 dirty smelly bathroom and cramped inside nothing like the photograph when i booked the bed was uncomfortable the bedding needs updating and the carpete wants cleaning or updating the bed corners were all scuffed up the bathroom smelled the whole stay which i mentioned to the front desk it smelled of sewers and also needed a good clean ,0
 the bed was really comfortable the view from the room was right over the river thames which was lovely the bathroom had a shower and bath and the staff were really helpful i forgot my hairdryer and asked the receptionist and got one sent to my room in 5 minutes couldn t fault this hotel was a very enjoyable stay and will definitely be booking again ,1
 we have been very disappointed as we faced a situation that we considered very cheap we have been informed at our arrival that we will be upgraded to a better room than the one we had during our previous visit the next day we complained on the fact that we have been downgraded as the room was for disabled and not practical at all for us also we had no microwave nor fridge like in the room we had previously to apologize the receptionist offered us a breakfast as a complementary for the next day we really appreciated the effort even if we do not eat in the morning we accepted as she was nice to offer the next day 08th november we informed the lady she looked like the supervisor or the head at reception about the offer we had to compensate us then we went for the breakfast the breakfast was already very simple and poor but the chock was that in the restaurant the waitress informed us that she has been requested to allow us only cold food and not hot food i liked the hotel but for this cheap reaction i will never go back this lady has given a very poor and bad image to this hotel ps we don t even eat hot food and usually only take a coffee and croissant so very cheap from a senior in the hotel ,0
 comfy bed nice breakfast great location close to underground lovely staff smiley and obliging ,1
 i was given the wrong room i paid for a double and they kept telling me that they would change me another one but they did not the shower did not work the first day the other two days it work improperly the staff always has excuses about why they could not give me a manager to talk to worst stay in london ever and so expensive incredible they still in business uncaring irresponsible robbery ,0
 being central for the hyde park concert good to be able to walk,1
 this hotel should be 2 stars not 4 stars be aware the rooms are nothing like on the photos this is small tiny rooms and really old and ugly the rug on the floor had many old stains in it and this is like a total disappointment i came to paris to meet my girlfriend for only 2 days and this ruin my trip first i arrived at 4 pm the room was not ready i needed to wait for 20 minutes then i had a key to a room and inside that room was a worker painting the room i went downstairs and the guy made a mistake so he gave me another room that room was really dirty and small and nothing like on the photos i went down again and they told me they were full i then told them i was not happy and wanted to do something about this then they told me they had another room that room was a little better but still the same and not cozy at all i usually not write bad reviews but this was a total disappointment also the price i paid was for 4 star hotel this is not a 4 star hotel really disappointed of this and the staff this hotel should not be 4 stars far from being a 4 stars hotel ,0

 the problem has happened both times we stayed at the property hot water goes of in the middle of the night so in the morning it s a freezing shower also water completely turns off throughout the day around 2 3 times for 3 4 hours which means no water to use for making tea washing your face a the odd shower someone wants in the day all these are not possible please check that the pillow covers have definitely been changed when you inspect them carefully you can see the hair gel the wax and in my experience some blood which i found when i turned the pillow over asking the reception to changes these is a night mare as they have the classical hotel excuse of cleaners are only available in the mornings sir no fridge very dusty the cleaners literally clean it so quick that upon a glance it looks clean but when you spend 5 minutes you can see how dirty the place really is not recommendable at all ,0
 the hotel kept 667 00 euros for one mouth locked and they refused to return me the money i will turn to a lawyer ,0

 2nd floor room 206 constant clonking noise either from lift shafts or generators that were outside our bedroom window the show cushions and runner on the bed were filthy if you are going to have them on beds then at least clean them regularly bedroom floor looked like it hadn t been vacuumed in a while and was dirty made sure i wore something on my feet at all times ,0

 awful awful hotel experience,0
 the building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty very than the pictures and various prices in different websites,0
 the breakfast that was included was a full english buffet and was really good the location was absolutely fabulous close to parliament the london eye westminster abbey and waterloo station not a cheap hotel but for where it is and the fact that it fit a family of four into one comfortable room a rarity in europe the value is amazing ,1

 the room was extremely tiny no space to place your luggage and extremely hot we could hardly managed to turn off the heating the stuff was unaware as to how the heating works as the feeling was pure suffocation had to leave the window wide open all night to wake up next morning from the smell of next door restaurant ,0
 listed as a five star hotel and it s a 3 4 star at best the staff are untrained and fumble through the simplest issues the room service guy doesn t bring a pen every time something was delivered to the room a major component was missing the restaurant staff no nothing of customer service one evening we were refused entrance because we might only order coffee even after we said we might order dessert we were refused a seat more than 75 of the tables were empty don t waste your money or time here there are many other options ,0
 good location grand victorian architechture,1
 rooms are very small staff in the reservations are evils although front desk guys are nice i have not seen good cooperation from the hotel every thing for them is money only so be careful ,0
 the staff were lovely that s really nice especially when travelling as a lone female ,1
 beautiful spacious rooms with moden design but in a cosy way very fast check in and check out beautiful spot very quiet ,1
 this hotel is dirty and multiple rooms are bug infested my bed had many bugs in it i got horrible bites all over my face and on my back only from being in this bed for about 15 minutes before i saw the bugs the toilet jammed almost every time i flashed spilling water on the bathroom floor wi fi in rooms not working no reach the rooms as well as the lobby are dark and depressing hotel staff does not speak sufficient english language to help the guests with many simple issues the experience from day 1 was very aggravating and disappointing i was paris in business attending important event and meeting many business partners too bad i had to attend all meetings with burning red swollen face from the bugs bites disgusting and unbelievable i would like this review to be a warning to other people considering their stay at villa lutece bugs were found in more rooms another colleague who was staying in a different room on a different floor was bitten too this is below any standard and the 4 stars which this hotel claims are absolutely not deserved and do not reflect the reality ,0
 comfortable bed great breakfast modern decoration,1
 beautiful property with a great history location couldn t be better very close to hyde and kensington park staff was helpful and prompt with request breakfast room was stunning it was close to two tube stations so it was very accessible for travel i would definitely stay there again ,1

 great location and interesting to stay in a place designed by the same person who did the interior of the titanic,1
 close to the tube clean rooms basement level was a bigger room free wifi quiet ,1
 well then constant building work which we werent warned about drilling directly into our room walls from above and side heavy banging around from the work being done above it was from check in and was still going on when we went out at 4 30pm and from 9 8 30am on sunday morning breakfast to room was totally cold and took an eternity to sort by the time it did we needed to rush to eat as check out time was near the thermostat in the room broke so we were cold and couldnt adjust it the best bit was leaving the hotel how can you charge these prices and not make people aware that they will be severly disrupted it was our 10 year anniversary and by far our worst every year we come to london and have never experienced anywhere neat as poor 4 star hotel this place comes nowhere near close for me ,0
 good locaci n near several underground stations easy to arrive to tourist places ,1
 the service was awful all our requests were declined i didnt get such bad service at any place one morning we didnt get towels for shower they didnt cleaned at all glasses were not cleaned we leaved before breakfast and asked for water at breakfast box but they refused to give us they could not supply almost anything at breakfast box zero effort to help us,0

 the location and cleanliness,1
 rooms very clean and spacious excellent breakfast,1
 the whole experience from start to finish was dispicible ,0
 bar staff very friendly and prices reasonable for the area,1
 i would never have booked this hotel if i had known they were going to give me a room sad excuse for a room in the basement next to the breakfast area lots of noise luckily i got another room for the second and third night the hotel was very noisy at all times as if the staff just did not want you to sleep because they wanted to start cleaning the rooms poor quality rooms falling apart expensive for what it was not coming back ,0
 1 room was very small hardly accommodating two people not able to sit no chair or walk within room to small to get access to tea table space to squeeze in very small 2 room not cleaned after first night no excuse or apologies offer to replace towels at midnight was probably not the best response to my complain room changed at 1 am a little bigger but still very small,0
 value for money and super staff ,1
 very comfortable room and shower facilities,1
 the location is good rue saint maur is a nice neighbourhood quite chilled out so you get a decent night s sleep but there are a couple of nice bars and places to eat very closeby not too touristy area but also easy to hop on the metro to get to those areas quickly would stay in this area again ,1
 only one armchair when 2 shown on website for room mini bar not stocked no response from staff when these points twice mentioned bed sheets hardly covered the mattress not luxury ,0
 when i arrived with my husband i was asked if i wanted to upgrade to a window room as i only had room without window so i agreed only if my view wasn t construction sight female gave me me a room with windows but only had view of construction sight do had to go and ask to move which i moved to room 810 which annoyingly had to separate single beds i then ordered a pizza at 12pm from food counter went to collect and was told it would only be another ten minutes so i waited and waited to then be told they have no pizza i waited an hour with no apology just that they hd need busey so wasn t happy also i thought the whole pool area could do with a refurbished as very dirty,0

 horrible very small rooms no toiletries or mini bar and extremely noisy neighbours who despite complains to reception were shouting and screaming until 4am in early morning,0
 everything,1
 they provided a room in the basement which i did not like at all the room is very small the ceiling is very low as well when i requested them to change the room they told me that the room rates are high in the upper floors i think information related to room rates should be mentioned in the website in detail ,0
 i was thrown of the hotel at 11pm at night my partner who was working in the area had booked a room and he was stopped by the manager and a police officer who insisted we leave the hotel no refund was given and its disgusting how we was thrown out on the street at 11pm at night will be taking further action on this ,0
 we were placed in a disabled persons room without any prior advice or explanation from the staff when we booked in when i complained the front desk staff simply said it was common to put people in disabled rooms if the hotel was full i am 6 4 and using the basin was amost impossible,0
 sheets dirty and in general very unhappy with the stay because of that,0
 spacious comfy room ,1
 got back to the room at 4 15 pm the room hadn t been made up asked for the room to be made up then went to the bar we were ignored eventually served bought 4 glasses of champagne were not even offered any nuts bad lighting in the bed room in fact bad lighting everywhere gave the hotel a depressing atmosphere curtain broken so couldn t pull it properly no lift from car park to room so we struggled with our luggage ,0
 very close to hyde park as we booked so we could go to bst concert only short tube ride to oxford street good location to explore london ,1
 instead of a double bed the put 2 twin beds together ac not working 2 heaters in the room were already there noise from the street all night and in the morning from loading and unloading lots of noise from the cleaning staff on the hallway dirty bathroom trashbin door carpet dirty the shower was not working we had to use the tub,0

 it was beautiful and is was very clean location was perfect too ,1
 good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp no noise problem but the lovely garden is gone sill good value for money this is a big place lovely old building ,1
 every thing was at it s place,1
 bed sheets were filthy stains on the sheets and little tiny hairs room was very small with no window asked for a different room but they could not change this for our 2 night stay staff at reception were quite open to conplain to each other about background matters very unprofessional ,0
 we booked a room as we were attending a concert at the o2 the hotel is right next door to the o2 and has it s own entrance into the o2 building the staff were incredibly friendly and very helpful the room was great and the view from the window was very cool well worth the money as avoided packed public transport before and after the show can t wait to stay there again ,1
 the appearance of the hotel was lovely and the staff were very helpful,1
 the bathroom bed the kind staff and breakfast plus the hotel amazing ,1
 terrible place far from everything not really in shoreditch on a noisy road beds not comfy awful smell in the room just horrible good price but for a very good reason won t be coming back ,0
 very good staff room was a good size with a very comfortable bed clipper bar is a lovely place to sit and relax and again the staff were very good we had dinner in the brassiere restaurant and the food was good quality and again service was good we didn t know this until we checked in but the spa facilities are complementary so we would recommend using them ,1
 the hotel is very old and requires reconstruction ,0
 great place if you just want a convenient and cheap place for a night staff are excellent and very polite,1
 rooms were tatty bed was uncomfortable not what i would expect from a hilton hotel,0
 size of room and bathroom given the low price great location close to tube ,1
 although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city ,1
 location to o2 was great breakfast was excellent though tea and coffee was cold when served ,1
 they don t clean properly didn t change the sheets they just sort the old ones they went in and claned the room when the privcy sign was there and they didn t actually clean just changed the towels and sorted the bed the heater stopped twice during my stay had to spend a night with an external one for such a name i was expecting better services,0
 nothing in the hotel it was a poor hotel ,0
 location is excellent across the river from big ben and parliament ,1
 warm friendly staff,1
 room too small and noisy,0
 no hot water for a shower hotel not interested in helping ,0
 rooms are very small we stayed at 2 bedroom apartment type there was no bedroom in one of rooms only the bed in a box type walls you feel like you sleep in a box we stayed 7 days and they did not change the sheets at all not a once hotel workers are not helping to carry your luggages only the lady called olivia helped to bring our luggages to the room at the check in but at the check out olivia was not there thanks to her she is very helpfull they only watched how we struggle with the luggages also the day before we checked out i asked a man at the front desk can t remember his name to book a taxi and ask the total price to go consulate first and then airport he asked and tell us that taxi driver said it s 80 euros he spoke in french so i could not understand we accepted next morning taxi driver came and asked that if we are going to airport we said no he didnt tell you we have to go consulate first ok we went airport finally and he charged us 140 euros and he said 80 is the only airport fee so i don t know who is the liar but my advice is do not book a taxi from hotel ,0
 too expensive,0

 room lovely,1
 the room was not clean when we arrived we needed to ask for big towels new bedsheets and toilet paper there was no toilet paper when we arrived small entrance and stairway do not take big suitcases with you the room bathroom and bed were small for one person maybe ok but for 2 to small the room was really noisy hospital cars pass every few minutes you almost hear everything from outside ,0

 filthy dirty hotel with congealing old food left outside the rooms at night and still there at 9h30 the next morning the stench of old take out food in the corridors is nauseating the rooms had to be changed twice shocking accommodation with no thought given to the layout of the room door opening onto the bed and not able to open further bathroom door opening onto the toilet so that it is virtually impossible to sit on the toilet very old uncomfortable mattresses broken cupboard doors which after complaining for 4 days were still not fixed or attended to on the 4th day useless incompetent unhelpful staff that did nothing and only knew how to apologize but not attend to or resolve anything never again ,0

 the whole experience in this hotel was horrendous not one single english speaking person at all what bar person doesn t understand the word coca cola what manager of a hotel doesn t understand when you ask for a pint of peroni and thinks your asking for a cake menu was rubbish not even bacon on the breakfast menu its all catered for other nationalities lighting in the rooms is shocking we stayed in the executive suite and not a window in there at all its right next to the cleaning cupboard where the cleaners think its ok to be banging doors at 7 0clock in the morning the area this place is in is a run down high street with none stop traffic and police sirens constantly its suppose to be in camden when its no where near camden you have to catch a bus to get to camden which is a half hour ride away no way could you go out here at night the area is too intimidating ,0

 when we arrive the hotel we 3 rooms for 7 nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about 1 2 months in advance we were very disappointed it was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station ,0
 deluxe double room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed 1 time on several occasions i saw the front desk staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation i was promised an upgrade to a club room after 1 night but the front desk never followed up on this ,0
 lovely breakfast in two beautiful rooms bedrooms are quite small but amenities all there ,1
 right next to dome posh ,1

 very pleased with the room the service and the breakfast,1
 rooms temperature don t work also we ordered a bottle of dring came late no good service shame,0
 rooms dangerously small highly overpriced booking com did not give me value for money as the hotel website offered the room at almost 40 less than i paid there was no breakfast included,0
 we were advised on arrival that the restaurant would be closed during our visit as my husband has mobility issues this mattered to us and we should have been clearly advised of this before booking we walked out to the nearest restaurant a very plain looking indian restaurant chillies which was well reviewed on tripadvisor and the food was great so it was a fun evening but not the wedding anniversary surroundings we had anticipated returned to the hotel with our friends family for a drink on the roof terrace which closes at 9 p m we got there at 8 45 and were immediately told it would be closing shortly the interior bar has great views but very hard d cor our guests decided to call it a night we returned to our room to have a cup of tea and watch telly but the telly didn t work it repeatedly threw up a message saying weak signal we called reception to ask if it could be fixed and a young man arrived who looked at the tv and said it has a weak signal a bit monty pythonish at that point so we gave up and read a book found the bed hard when we finally tried to sleep and the air con kept shutting off didn t call reception for fear they would send a young man who would give us as much help as he had done with the tv which is to say advise us that the air con keeps shutting off had intended to try the spa the next morning but based on our evenings experience we didn t bother ,0
 great room,1
 food staff nose not clean enough,0
 breakfast was very good good spread ,1
 cleanliness of the room was disgusting drink in the room was finished while we were out staff not helpful asked 6 times for extra cups and didn t receive it asked for ice to the room and never received it plug in the bathroom didn t work hairdryer was so slow it would be quicker to hang your head outside,0
 facilities were great my room was great value for money and the restaurant was great ,1
 the hotel looked very old and dull carpet not clean the bed was very uncomfortable i had back pain the next morning although free wifi was advertised there was no connection mostly the entire time i was there and when i called the receptionist she said they are fixing it but it was never fixed the remote was not working too so i had to change channels manually most of the time ,0
 really handy for the tube always very clean and probably the comfiest beds i ve slept in ,1
 staff not helpful i checked out the night before so i could get away in the morning as there are queues a reception they told me i d have the bill emailed it wasn t and i ve called 4 times since to be told the bill will be emailed i m still waiting for the bill ,0
 we loved the location and the attitude of the staff lovely people the room was fine ,1
 the location was great the bed was comfy and the lighting was fab head to le petit ch telet near notre dame for a fabulous meal ,1
 do not stay if 1 you have luggage there is no place for your car to stop on the road and our request for someone to help us with the luggage up the stairs was ignored your car will have to park opposite the hotel in a side road and you will have to push your luggage across a busy road and thronging sidewalks whereupon you then have the further privilege of carrying luggage up the stairs on your own request for assistance will be ignored same applies when you check out 2 you have children who watch television the television channels do not work they did offer to change us to a room with working television channels if extra amounts were paid 3 you watch the news for the same reasons cited above television is an extra cost that you have to pay for 4 travel with companions only one set of towels was provided despite a family booking a request for extra sets was met with a direction to look in the cupboard we found one extra set therein which after our hunt was still insufficient 5 you want a normal bed beds were set on wheels and moved away from the headboard as the night passed i would have liked to give a score of zero if possible ,0

 staff were awful rooms tiny dated and not satisfactory for a 5 star hotel rooftop bar serving overpriced warm flat drinks not open 24hours as advertised ,0
 an old wobbly armchair was said to be a bed for our little girl and others amenities were in poor condition it s a pity the place could be pleasant as there s a lovely terrace and it s an ancient charming building ,0
 breakfast was excellent very central hotel,1
 the windows were filthy on the inside see photo could not open the window would have got covered in dirt while trying in any case and the room was too hot asked them to open it when i went out but they didn t curtain falling off rail so privacy poor could hardly hear the tv at times due to traffic noise in a very small room tv at foot of the bed nowhere to put case no room for a chair or table hardly room to stand up beside bed and get dressed dining room too small so had to queue ages for breakfast toast was not toasted just died up bread their philosophy is pack em in tight and charge a lot of money because we re in a good spot ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very spacious,1
 my go to place when in london this was my 5th stay great location within walking distance from earl s court underground station piccadilly line from heathrow staff is friendly rooms are up to date and clean ,1
 no a c farther from kings cross than advertised ,0
 dirty carpets in bedroom,0
 nothing at all the hotel is very poor and over priced when we got to the room we were shocked they sent us to unprepared room and there was no bedding no sheets or covers consequently the matters was revealing so dirty lamps were broken no dnd sign safe is not working unless if we request a key from reception no lock for bathroom door moreover the lift was not working finally they have charged me twice,0
 the decoration of the hotel foyer was lovely and the paintings on the ceilings were fabulous ,1
 excellent location and staff,1
 the hotel was very old and not painted well the bathroom was smaller than the airplane ,0
 lovely hotel central with 3 underground stations within walking distance lovely caf s and individual shops nearby,1
 staff was rude and impolite kept us waiting for long and ignored us while attending other guests even after requesting checkout at 5 30 am they did it only around 6 10 we requested vegetarian breakfast to be packed it just had 2 biscuits and one small muffin and ice tea ,0
 bfast spread the same daily walls so thin u can hear everything in the other rooms on day 1 2 i had a guest seated outside my room at 4am blasting his music and talking on his mobile ,0
 the room was really small the fan in the bathroom didn t turn off and there was an enourmous air con fan right outside our window which was on all through the night,0
 the bed could be a bit more comfy ,1
 very noisy ,0
 staff,1
 the hotel is tired and run down not a good experience,0
 great location friendly staff lovely room although a bit on the small side for a twin room very lovely building with real character gorgeous stair case and chandelier ,1
 the front desk where very kind and helpful ,1
 the room was very comfortable and quiet ,1
 comfortable spacious room cleanliness overall lovely shower ,1
 loved the staff,1
 the room 105 was ludicrously small the wall was cold and given how small the room was i woke up every time i turned in bed the breakfast was mediocre poached eggs hard white sliced bread ,0
 the bed was very comfortable,1
 clean up of the room should be timely,0
 good location lots of restaurants around and close to metro,1
 location of hotel was excellent nice quiet street yet very close to undergound statation,1
 good bed clean ,1
 we waited 40 minutes after arrival time because room was not ready eventually upgraded us the room was ok worse london hotel we have stayed in so would not recommend ,0
 comfortable bed good facilities ,1
 excellent location staff very friendly and helpful were able to answer all our questions ,1
 nice comfortable room and very great location lovely food in the restaurant italia very good standard ,1
 the friendliness of the staff at all times very welcoming,1
 the beds were so uncomfortable that my partner ended up staying on the sofa very over priced ,0
 on the last day we asked the hotel staff to arrange a taxi in the end it was a private van that required us to take our luggage and walk one street to get to it when we got to the car the driver demanded an additional 10 saying that he did not know we are going terminal five when we got there i wanted to pay by credit card and he said it will required an additional 10 in the end the cost is 76 more expensive than uber ,0
 the actual building with all that marble wide staircases and corridors exudes old world style and luxury the staff are wonderful they look good happy and alert and are unfailingly polite and helpful ,1
 how different it was from other hotels the staff the bar area and the location was good for tram access,1
 so much dust old structure value for money not appropriate bad experience,0
 impressive function room quality of food for a function tasty and well presented good staff,1
 everything,0
 our sheets for the bed were not clean and had snot on the pillowcase and sheets we called reception to have it replaced and when we came back 6 hours later nothing was done we called again and the member of staff that turned up did not apolygise once and seemed fustrating that they had to provide us with clean sheets and did not care hoe much it would bother someone who paid alot of money this was our second time staying here based on how much we loved it here before and unfortunately this is be our last based on this experience,0
 we felt mislead with the picture from online the room that we selected from on line is not the same as when we saw it it is substandard for the price we paid the chair was dirty the desk drawer was broken there were lots of stain marks on the floor the baseboard was dirty we had paper and plastic cups to drink how are we supposed to drink our bordeaux wine nothing in the fridge other than a single bottle of small evian water no toiletries when asked for a room transfer the front desk staff a guy was rude and non apologetic for our inconvenience overall it was bad experience and booking com has the responsibility towards us i could send you pictures of the room if you wish or i can post it on facebook,0
 staff were friendly and very helpful ,1
 the staff are very friendly and very helpful from checking in to checking out we really enjoyed our stay here with the arena so close you realise how lucky you are to be staying here ,1
 first of all the rooms were too small there is no sofa or chair to sit if you open your suitcase on the floor you literaly no place to walk around so you have to jump over it the bed is too small for two people that was really uncomfortable with the worst thing in london was this hotel there is no place to hang your towel in the bathroom and that s just one example to emphasize the size breakfast room is in the basement so there is no windows ,0
 great location,1
 staff not well cooperate especially at check in cleaning is not good rooms are small you can hear your neighbor room when he standing speaking go to toilet and what he do old hotel need renewed,0
 breakfast charged as extra for a de lux room is a joke,0
 safety and complete lack of help from the hotel staff we were robbed we came back to our room to find out that my laptop the charger and our cash were nowhere to be found unfortunately that was not the worse part the horrible reponse of the manager of the hotel was unbelievable ,0
 location,1
 rooms were spacious and comfortable very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful was an absolute pleasure,1
 the first room the mini bar was off and the room just smelt awfully of mold the mini bar was not clean and the room still looked as if you could tell someone else had been in it the staff were rude due to that we eventually moved rooms just to miss the eiffel tower lights come on why we were spending so much to stay so close they charge 13 euro just for two coffees i would definitely not recommend the brighton to anyone ,0
 only stayed for one night so can only rate the room as didn t use any of the facilities thought it was lovely and the most comfortable bed we had ever slept in also the pillows were so comfortable that i had a look at the make of them and am going to order some for ourselves ,1
 the staff service was excellent the location is brilliant definitely recommend ,1
 not a lot,0
 excellent breakfasts very clean staff was helpful ,1
 comfy bed and good facilities in the room great location ,1
 bad room too small bad customer service ,0
 in the first room the a c didn t work so the room temperature was 28 degrees which made for an uncomfortable night option to open the window but with the noise of the tube station outside meant it wasn t ideal plus with work taking place to the exterior of the building with scaffolding covering the entirety of the exterior there was no privacy or safety if the windows were open the staff moved us to a second room where the a c was still not working and just left the windows open the drain was blocked which meant water in the sink and shower just collected and drained extremely slowly overall all a terrible experience and poor customer service as no form of compensation was offered and no attempt was made by the staff to rectify the problem before the next guests ,0
 everything was top rate ,1
 staff they transferred me to nice hotel because there was problem in hotel thanks,1
 staff very friendly helpful and welcoming from the moment you enter upgraded free to a double room instead of a single fantastic central location moments away from tube station and an easy walk to central london locations lovely clean spacious comfortable room and fantastic room service ,1
 staff are amazing had an issue with my room and they fixed it straight away was given another room ,1
 room design especially bathroom,0
 staff was very pleasant and helpful beds were extremely comfortable choice of a tub and a separate shower in the same bathroom was very convenient location is excellent ,1
 creaky floorboards squeaky room doors corridor doors slam hot water takes 5 minutes to come through nowhere near a tube station no view the layout of the hotel is shocking even the staff haven t a clue which lift guests should take took me 15 minutes to get to my room with the help of three staff members somehow my auto generated rating of this stay was 3 8 no way i d give it 1 for cleanliness ,0
 the location,1
 everything,0
 excellent location helpful staff comfortable room heated bathroom floor and lovely towels nice and big ,1
 fantastic central location came into waterloo and walked from the hotel everywhere we arrived early but were still able to check in which was a bonus and facilitated changing shoes and using the bathroom good breakfast,1
 the room was big and spacious and the bed was soooooo comfy beautiful bathroom and shower and breakfast was amazing,1
 bad neighbourhood no lounge or chairs at reception poor wifi overpriced accomodation,0
 very pleasant staff great character hotel very clean and comfortable right next to tube station would definitely stay there again,1
 room was too small with stairs going down into it from the landing loud noises from the ceiling during the night the lift didn t work so i had to carry everything down the stairs the air conditioning didn t work properly and leaked in to my open suitcase ,0
 cleanliness of room disgusting decoration of room disgusting and falling off walls hotel staff attitude terrible no help with changing room etc,0
 a very bright and modern hotel staff in bar area were very pleasent and friendley i would stay here again ,1
 tiny room extremely rude staff no accommodations for handicaps no elevator had to walk up 3 flights of stairs with a broken ankle heavy suitcase i m a 62yr old woman staff wouldn t even talk to me let alone try to help when i asked if it was possible to call a cab the next morning i was told to walk to the cab office with my broken ankle room was very expensive room was so small my suitcase wouldn t fit in the room seriously that small ,0
 easy check in and having right i m ready when arriving early,1
 noise cleanliness and some of the staff,0
 the pillowsand duvets were perfect,1
 breakfast was fine plenty of hot water clean towels very friendly obliging staff underground was only an 8 min walk with the bakerloo line you have very good access to all the main areas ,1
 paying 167 for 1 night for an extra city view room which is a view of the hotel across the road squashed breakfast tinned food not enough seats outside to tables faulty equipment room not cleaned properly not actually in county hall doors not fitted properly and no milk for a hot drink completely spoilt our 30th wedding anniversary and still no contact apology from anyone at park plaza appalling standards for an hotel which won an award ,0
 i need to do a full review on tripadvisor the staff were amazing an upgrade bottle of wine left for our anniversary food really good a fabulous hotel and can t wait to go back ,1
 the bed was comfortable there was a free safe very clean room not far from the tube station local shops and restaurants ,1
 service has declined massively since i stayed 2 years ago just not worth the price ,0
 bed like concrete pillows non existent the shower leaked all over the bathroom,0
 even after insisting on a room change after the so called superior double transpired to be no more than a shoe box we were allocated a club room in the basement with a view of a wall no daylight the room was cramped and small and the bathroom was no bigger than a toilet cubicle with a tiny shower enclosure even the sink in the bathroom was so tiny that you could not have used it to wash in ,0
 when i called the hotel to ask if there was a restriction on check in time the customer service operate said i believe it is 24 hours and that there should not be a problem this is not a very definite response when i asked her to check and confirm that all was in order with my booking should could not find it because i booked with bookings com and then transferred me to two different numbers where nobody picked up then said there was nothing she could do so i had to ring back later this is not very helpful when you are traveling what would have happened if they did not find my booking when i got there given my card had already been charged was i going to have to book another room on check in which took approx 30 mins i was told i had a smoking room i did not request this and if i wanted a non smoking room it would cost and additional 20 gbp per night there was very little provided in the room not even complimentary water hairdryer the volume from the tv in the room next door was very high and could be heard clearly until late in the night so for a bad experience not very friendly staff a non smoking room it has cost me 378 gbp for 2 nights i am not happy ,0
 rooms to small not made up every day lift out of order for the full 8 day stay breakfast not good for the price constant repair people doing work,0
 the reception staff were very helpfull the facilities were excellent and the location was very good will definitely use the hotel again ,1
 the room was dusty and so so small me and my husband have asthma we wanted a room with a bath well the bath was so small my feet were hanging out i m 5 foot 1 my poor husband is taller so well he didn t even try we kept bumping our feet ect my husband got so clostraphobic he went outside several times for some air i ordered some food to our room but was so shocked the chicken wings still had feathers on them i was horrified i couldn t sleep the pillow was so flat it was a very disappointing experience,0
 the reception staff were really unhelpful and glum they never smiled almost any request was too much trouble in a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key these appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed a poor reflection of the brand and hotel ,0
 loved the fact that the hotel was so centrally situated each evening went back to a really comfortable room where we could relax and look out over london at night,1
 comfy beds,1
 grand royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard we had to ask to switch rooms as the tv didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed this hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and was offered an upgrade with an awesome view of the london eye with an early check in,1
 generally it s a wonderful experience the hotel is within walking distance of earl s court station very convenient location there re cafe bakery fast food supermarket very near to the hotel the staffs at the reception are polite and helpful especially a gentleman the room space is sufficient there s no problem to put two large suitcases the tv is new and major english tv programs are provided mattress is comfortable it s glad to find water boiler in the room so i can make some tea complimentary mint chocolate and drinking water are provided the cleanness is excellent no dirty spot is found bath towels and amenities are changed everyday the surrounding area is safe to hang around during night it costs only around 100 pounds per night which is a good deal ,1
 good location friendly staff ,1
 we stayed for our 1 year anniversary and the staff bumped us up to executive suite free of charge thankyou,1
 great staff had a single room which was compact but very comfortable and well equipped ,1
 tiny room paint peeling off walls damp,0

 the room was very quiet proximity to the tube station was convenient has a garden,1
 the penthouse suit views were amazing everything was top class ,1
 it was in a fabulous location and my room was cozy and clean ,1

 staff really polite and friendly ,1
 upgrade on arrival was a pleasant surprise,1
 great location with small but nice room will book again,1
 watery juices uncooked sausages,0

 the false advertising of a single for a double to get me to click on the lenorard hotel and i will not use booking com in future which i have used for the last number of years ,0
 i d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday we got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful lovely room very comfy bed ,1
 there was no water in the complimentry tray with tea and coffee there is no fridge carpet are old and smelly wifi not available in rooms no free parking ,0
 excellent facilities and room we went to a concert at the o2 perfect location to stay short walk,1
 they confused our rooms up we had to be moved down to the dungeons rooms below they were very dark rooms we were not happy ,0
 the room was excellent and so were all the staff lovely decor and breakfast ,1
 excellent helpful staff comfort ,1
 the decor is dated the bed small the hotel is in need of maintenance they will charge you for everything extra there wasn t a fridge in the room and yet they would charge us 5 everytime they would come upstairs to deliver anything even water the showers didn t work properly getting cold and hot to the point of burning my skin the swimming pool is an extra 4 per person and it s absolutely filthy and the easter decoration was ridiculous picture attached ,0
 room was in basement no natural light very noisy,0
 1 it took me 30 mins o checkin checkin was pathetic 2 the receiption was not sure of breakfast timing huge gap in coordination between staff which is not expected from novotel ,0
 staff made our stay extra special as they knew it was a birthday weekend break excellent room food service ,1
 the hotel has no direkt access from the elevator to the room there is only access with stairs the free wifi is very very poor you can not use skype or any other free voice apps and you can forget about watching movies online the hotel room was very dirty and old ,0
 i was taken seriously ill during my stay the staff could not have been more helpful and considerate far beyond what i would have expected ,1
 balcony,1
 location and a very nice room ,1
 good price compared to high london prices ,1
 incredibly hot room very very very noisy location above a turkish restaurant on a busy road mattress very hard making for a very poor nights sleep,0
 location very clean and nice rooms swimming pool fast wifi comfortable bed,1
 very nice knowledgeable staff clean comfortable accommodations ,1
 uuufhh where do i even start the rooms have no space you feel confined in them you can hear the person next door through the walls the hotel is a long walk from the nearest station the housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came 4 times between 11 and 12 noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though i told her not come in again the hotel should be 2 star and i don t know how they were rated 4 star perhaps it is self acclaimed i wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t a word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words ,0
 dry clean,1
 stayed for a single night to see a show 1st rate staff 1st rate service very helpful very welcoming easy access to hyde park which we strolled through to shop on kennisington high st on day 1 and then left the bags at the hotel after checkout the following day to visit oxford st queensway tube station is just on the next street ,1
 the staff are very helpful and polite ,1
 we were not allocated a double as requested and were given the option of an uncomfortable twin or a tiny double that seemed to be for single occupation overall we felt the hotel lacked the quality one would hope from a 4 and would liken it to more of a soulless 2 we frequently visit barcelona as it is such a vibrant and stylish city which is not reflected in this lacklustre and unremarkable hotel ,0
 fantastic staff and efficient service,1
 excellent location lovely decorated lots of personality and pure english athmosphere ,1
 location of hotel lovely rooms guest lounge a great bonus,1
 personal greetings from the staff for the occasion of my husband s birthday,1
 the room was beautiful with the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in it had great facilities the staff were ever so helpful the hotel itself was light bright spacious with contemporary d cor and everything you would expect from a london location it was amazing and just a stones throw from the o2 arena i was suitably impressed ,1
 the style of the rooms were great and very clean ,1
 location room small but great,1
 the staff and the room was fantastic i would like to stay again soon thanks,1
 bed very uncomfortable very hot very noisy bed side table lamp not working door lock not working couldn t connect to wifi got a very bad rash from bed sheets,0

 very good hotel,1
 ver very small space no venilation,0
 the staff i need a response for swiping my wrong credit card ,0
 location and facilities,1
 just loved the hotel and spa,1
 rooms really need to be renewed bathroom not well cleaned some long black hair found in the tub tile broken not replaced bad smell in room like all of these hotel type the reception and the commons are renewed but not the rooms overrated not a 4 star comfort but surely a 4 star price even though discounted ,0
 the location was great and active room was clean and comfort if u will stay in this hotel u will find alot of coffee shops and alot of resturants around u by walking only ,1
 decent location friendly and helpful staff ,1
 worst management ever,0

 location and staff wonderful ,1
 bed comfy iron provided all good,1
 very clean comfy bed great breakfast,1
 the staff were amazing and the room facilities and bathroom were really nice ,1
 room was very nice and view was amazing,1
 staff very friendly,1
 rooms not luxury as it should be very unconfortable mttress,0
 will be making a complaint water came through the bathroom light the solution was to wipe it up with tissue and because it stopped dripping that was the leak fixed as a gas engineer i was shocked at the lack of investigation to find the source the panel above the bathroom didnt get moved to see where it was coming from both staffs english very poor and didnt understand what i was saying i over heard ot happened the previous day and also the room next door had the same problem so obviously lack of experience in this field to fix basic plumbing also had a funny smell in the hall and bedroom ,0
 room had very noisy heater fan on all night maintenance man said it was unacceptable receptionist tried to say that it was my sensitive hearing can t bear people like that,0
 upon check in i was asked to move to a sister property apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size they miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small incredibly dirty i will not be back i checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee i will not be back ,0
 the rooms are clean but dated the bed was about as comfortable as sleeping on the floor the only light in the room was by way of a small window in the corner and a couple of floor lamps couldn t have been further from the bright rooms featuring lots of light i thought i had booked ,0
 the location as well as the breakfast ,1
 the property was historically interesting and the staff were excellent ,1
 everything was good apart from the carpets which were disgusting,1
 good location for hyde park and paddington station near bus routes excellent breakfast with good choices ,1
 everything there was nothing we did not like it was perfect ,1
 on the first night the standard room was tiny we had to pay extra to get a room that was just about acceptable for two people we paid 750 for four nights in what i would consider to be a one or two star hotel at best everything is old and tired and in poor repair stained carpets and threadbare little towels instead of bath towels the shower barely worked and the free internet was useless they wanted 12 day for standard speed internet that you can get in mcdonalds there were 39 french tv channels and one in english i don t think that they expect international guests the hotel is just dull dreary and pokey even the ac didn t work properly when you set it to 23degc it freezes the room when you turn it off you cant breath after half an hour even though i didn t include breakfast when booking they give you vouchers at check in to trick you into having a very basic breakfast which they then charge 19 for overall i felt ripped off and it spoiled the weekend for us wouldn t go back there again ,0
 cleaners just did tidy up around they didn t change bed sheets when i m back to my rooms i check which was same we couldn t open windows hotels walls were very thin you can hear every sound ,0
 the building was beautiful and the rooms nicely decorated ,1
 i am a frequent traveling and this is unfortunately the worst hotel i have ever stayed in extremely small room one way in and one way out floor in reception area needs lots of love misleading based on images shown on the website wifi was miserable,0
 excellent location the staff were friendly and helpful comfortable room though the bathroom was a little cosy ,1
 love the nespresso machine in the room,1
 service was great room was excellent good value overall ,1
 everything was very dated and dusty we didn t even shower because the bathroom was disgusting i ll never go back in that hotel i usually use hostels for my travels and they are far better than this hotel ,0
 staff attitude,0
 great breakfast excellent location nice building free smartphone with internet available which is super convenient for foreigner great bathroom,1
 i booked a deluxe twin room as per the photos it looked good enough when we got into the room which was hardly 3m x 3m i thought i made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with 10 cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back the room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse good staff but greedy greedy management and owners really bad experience ,0
 room service food very poor cold and not good quality woken up at 2am in the morning by other guests having a party in their room the drain covers in the shower were off the toilet button was missing and the television didn t work complained to guest relations in the morning who tried to fob me off as i didn t complain when i got the room service i explained it was late and we were fed up we pushed for more compensation and eventually got have to say we had a terrible experience and there seemed no desire to make up for it ,0
 room had the most wonderful view of the river and the hotel was perfect for the o2 l loved every minute of the stay,1
 location,1
 100 going again really enjoyed it and beautiful building ,1
 we arrived at almost 14 00 and our room wasn t ready so we were told we were to be upgraded to a luxury room the room was a shoe box with sloping walls making it smaller with absolutely no view a brick wall and large air con units right outside the window 2m away this shouldn t have been a hotel room at all but a store room the noise from these units is like the drone of an aircraft and we both had terrible nights sleep the photos are not tricks this was our view have a look at the luxury rooms on the website something is not quite right after we complained were given money off the bill however we felt completely let down by staff trying to tell us rooms are only categorised by their sqft not by their features i e brick wall view the photograph of our room was used as a description for a superior room so much for luxury we ve stayed at the sister hotel the soho hotel far better with large standard rooms check out is at 11am on sundays boo we won t be going back ,0
 there was a small problem on checking in when i discovered that the room i was allocated was still in use the staff though dealt with it very quickly and i ended up with a really good room ,0
 staff appeared not to understand english taxi drivers were very rude and gave the full tour of paris to get to your desired location at max cost ,0
 breakfast quite comfortable,1
 had to take 2 separate elevators walk down 3 long hallways to get to the smallest room i have ever been in you could barely walk around the bed no room to open a suitcase ,0
 the room was small dark and smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke the shower was dirty and the fridge didn t work we asked for another room but the only alternative was not much better and faced backwards would not recommend staying here ,0
 check in took forever the queue was out the door many staff were just floating about asking questions like are you checking in rather than actually checking us in the large double bed was not large in width but was very high off the ground and had a slope from middle to edges making it really uncomfortable ,0
 the staff were so helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble and the facilities were excellent the room was so comfortable and we had everything we needed for our stay,1
 terrible attitude from the staff they were very rude and disrespectful need to be more clear on what is included within the price ,0
 this was our second visit after being impressed last year beautiful building with ornate carved wooden panelling the staff were very helpful rooms very comfortable and breakfast is excellent close to the underground for the city centre and opposite hyde park for a stroll ,1
 room and bed spacious and comfortable close to amenities in bercy village plus metro,1
 everything it was lovely ,1
 room is poorly maintained and not clean housekeeping job is very sloppy and never replenish amenity i have to make extra call for shower gel tissue shower cap etc everyday during my stay no mineral water supply at night elevator is not clean with smell i changed room 3 times each room has some level of outdated odor front desk staffs are indifference concierge ignored my inquiry on restaurants for two days until a senior concierge on board who took care of all inquiry overall i am surprised it is a 5 star hotel ,0
 great price and location,1
 the attention to detail in all respects was very impressive with service and servility to match the location which we were unsure about turned out to be ideal as within metres tube bus or taxi s were available we travelled by car but left it in the car park it was a pleasure to be without it well done intercontinental ,1
 hotel is in a great location for london eye and southbank rooms are well designed but bed a little hard hotel staff set up sofa bed for our kids to share which was a nice touch breakfast was really good too would definitely stay again ,1
 great place good stuff lovely hotel in general,1
 great location and easy access to central london,1
 unfriendly staff,0
 elegant and modern interior all needs were satisfied ,1
 the staff at the hotel were amazing so welcoming and attentive ,1
 room way too small housekeeping service not done wifi does not work in room,0
 the staff were lovely and very helpful,1
 this hotel is excellent i stay at a lot of hotels in london and this is value for money refurbished to a high standard,1
 the location is great and the staff very cooperative but the room very small,1
 location,1
 location was brilliant the vibe of the area is pretty chill yet classy,1
 the staff were very nice there was a mistake with our room and since it was my boyfriends birthday they gave us an even better room with complimentary wine for both of us was really special i only stayed a night for the occasion wish i stayed longer ,1
 the room was extremely old not worth the money by any means i had stayed there once before and they didn t try to put me in a nicer room they should not be selling those old rooms ,0
 very peaceful quiet for such a busy london location excellent breakfast with something for everyone public areas were beautiful ,1
 dirty rooms,0
 we stayed as we were attending a gig at the o2 and it was very well located for that and avoided the aggro of getting home an expensive hotel but good service comfortable rooms and bed two well located bars and a restaurant we enjoyed but was probably 20 over priced a very enjoyable and relaxed even decadent over night stay and jess glynne was excellent,1
 quality and facilities need to be improved if you wanted to get customer back i had to leave after one night for another hotel in paddington area ,0
 nothing no value for money for tiny room with grumpy staff i should of rented paris apartment for same as this hotel which i am doing now 2 bedroom 100sqm 2 bathrooms and toilet located in ternes for same daily costs as novetel paris central never again will i book hotels on the basics of nice advertising photos and fictitious customer reviews if anyone says that the novetel paris is an excellent hotel then i know that that is pure fiction and possibly other hotels on your site are possibly just the same get back to me if you need any further information thanks peter woroniuk,0
 lived in the basement small room and a bit far from the station,0
 1 we received the wrong rooms not those reserved 2 we received used rooms with used sheets and used towels the cleaner did not clean the room 3 the air condition did not work and maintenance refuesd to fix it couldn t sleep at night was to hot 4 sercive was he worst i ever experienced we asked to talk to manager but he was never there and when the manager received our complaints he ignored we felt like the hotel crew waited that just leave,0
 not like anything,0
 air conditioning in room didn t work and despite complaining wasn t fixed carpets walls and public areas all felt dated and in need of refurbishment was perhaps a 4 star hotel once but not anymore,0
 the bathroom was dirty no shaver point and generally the room was dusty after cleaning the breakfasts were the worst i have had in a hotel in london it was cold even when the serving dishes were just topped up ,0
 there was strange smell in room especially when the bathroom was open 2 out of 4 lifts were out of order all the time our key to room was blocked before the time we should leave the room this hotel needs total renovation ,0
 old hotel ugly rooms ,0
 afternoon tea was lovely the service was impressive and we really adored fran who gave us a tour of the hotel and was most helpful in meeting all our needs from the bell hop to the concierge this hotel had the best service we ve ever experienced and we frequently travel via 5 star establishments we will return many times i m sure ,1
 terrible room my father had birthday so we booked the room in advance but he was given room on the first floor with stinky carpet and small dirty window the room looked like rabbit hole the type of the room was delux so it was more expensive the standard father strip to londob was spoiled we used to live in this hotel before best type of the room on the 3rd floor with the few to st james but the sanitary and carpets were old and stinky old furniture small room i do not suggest the hotel stuff is unfriendly and rude ,0
 staff were unfriendly and hard to understand what they were saying our room had really bad lightening and no full length mirror which made it hard to get ready the bathroom was so small could hardly move and part of the roof was hanging down ,0
 lovely room good breakfast,1
 we were sharing a twin room and got upgraded lovely big room with a balcony view over russell square gardens fab ,1
 the staff were lovely and very helpful bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links ,1
 the beds and pillows were really comfortable lovely the short walk to dinner which the receptionist booked for us on arrival great location to the venue,1
 the staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely,1
 the room was cold and heating did not work,0
 the a c are too nooosey it doesn t get cool we complained several times but no body responded the tv s was also not working for the whole week in one of the rooms second room it was auto operating couldn t get it off some of the rooms had bad smell ,0
 great location with lovely staff recommended for family ,1
 the hotel was not clean did not smell clean either the room was so small and uncomfortable i could not sleep the bathroom was not cleaned properly disgusting and disappointed,0
 room was on 1 air conditioning gave me a headache sleep was not as relaxing,0
 cleanliness comfort,1
 room not very clean and small breakfast not worth getting up for ,0
 the room was supposed to be one of their best the room smelled musty the furniture was old and uncomfortable the carpets where dirty and frayed ripped in places and the shower had black mould and ingrained dirt on the tiles sealant and grout the roller blind had dead flies embedded on it the restaurant and room service is non existent and the hairdyer didn t work tried to upload pictures but the site upload isn t working properly and could only upload the one picture,0
 the images of the rooms on the internet did not match with reality i paid 145 for a tiny room in the basement which had an unpleasant smell masked by air freshener or cleaning agent when i expressed my disappointment i was later handed a letter of apology and four pieces of fruit by way of compensation this was wholly inadequate as a frequent visitor to london i shall never stay in your hotel again and will not recommend it either ,0
 comfortable bed friendly and helpful staff,1
 staff very not welcoming there was no doorman to help with bags or door they want you to settle upfront even though you ve booked online with a card the room was dirty and cold as the window didn t close the room was very small and smells cigarette the bathroom very small everything was wrong and bad service from staff ,0
 the shower didn t work so could only have abt 3 secs of scalding water the place is grubby,0
 good for traveling south of the river as you would expect congestion on roads across the river means taxi travel is very slow during rush hour staff and facilities great bed very comfortable a great night s sleep unbeatable for o2 ,1
 the staff were fantastic and the hotel was amazing rooms were just something else and the views from the restaurants and bars just brilliant ,1
 the great brithish breakfast,1
 dark dank and depressing avoid this hotel at all costs it is not 4 star by any stretch of the imagination in fact i have stayed in better budget hostels ,0
 awful service we complained about a leak in our room twice and nothing was done about it paint was scratching off zero view directly facing a brick wall ,0
 the small room the unpolite stuff and the crowded place,0
 staff were lovely and helpful room very comfortable and clean ,1
 bed and pillow are perfectly nice,1
 the fact that the hotel stole 200 euros from us and have refused to answer our emails when we booked in we were told that the cost of the accommodation would be held plus 200 euros for any extra expenses if we paid on the same card when we checked out the 200 euros would go straight back in it did not and the full amount of 1 482 euros was kept even though we had a written quote for 1 280 euros for accommodation and did not use any other of the hotel facilities the cost was one of the reasons we chose the hotel in the first place had we known they were going to keep the equivalent of another night s accommodation we would not have chosen them in spite of contacting both the hotel and booking com nothing has been done about it this is theft pure and simple and booking com as we booked through you you are resposible also we were asked if we had any special requests we requested a quiet non smoking room and guess what we were put right next to the lift great service i do intend to pursue getting our money back by whatever means possible i believe the warwick is one of a chain of hotels and if we have to go straight to the top man we will ,0
 everything the rooms are very dirty with very old furniture the carpet very old and all the hotel was in a horrible situation,0
 great choice at breakfast ease of access to the arena ,1
 room,0
 very tired hotel,0
 stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms very comfortable,1
 the bed,1
 the room old dull dark depressing curtains old 70s look food service and staff bad manners rude,0
 quaint decorative style giving a feel of an edwardian era hotel ,1
 no climate control in rooms unable to turn radiators off no lift to 5th and 6th floor staff were unhelpful and unapologetic when we raised concerns asked for a debit card on arrival after they already having our credit card details said it was for a security deposit but it wouldn t be deducted from my account unless any damages when we check out they deducted it from my account straight away then simple told us to come back in the morning and they d refund it straight away after check out we did and they made us buy something from the mini bar again after checking out in order to release our security deposit straight away this still hasn t been refunded back to me 48 hours later now refusing to take my calls,0
 very friendly staff clean and luxurious ,1
 great ,1
 we were given an upgrade to a family room so had a sofa bed and kitchenette as well as our double room the kitchenette was well stocked with crockery and cutlery a microwave and nespresso machine as well as a kettle and small mini bar fridge the room was on the 11th floor and was very quiet with amazing views across the city we thought breakfast was expensive so didn t breakfast in the hotel ,1
 the rooms on the photos do not match the reality ,0
 we were upgraded due to husbands birthday nice touches in room,1

 the room we have been given was not as i saw in the picture at and the bed was too small and the room was too small no places to hang my clothes,0
 great room very comfortable,1
 we were allocated 2 rooms in the basement without windows i am surprised that this kind of rooms even exist after discussing the unstuitability of this with the very rude receptionist they gave us rooms one floor higher but in the very end of the corridor claimimg it was an upgrade this was after we explained that my husband has a heart condition so he can not stay in a room without windows rooms are tiny and of very poor standard ,0
 nice lobby good location to the park ,1
 great location for transport and restaurants staff couldn t have been more helpful ,1
 no wash cloths staff didn t even understand what they were room had no a c but they offered to open the windows moved us to a room supposedly with a c but it was a smoking room windows kept opening so dirt dust as well as residual smell from smoking made room unbearable furnishings were all nicked up carpet dirty sofa stained and hot water control on shower so sensitive you either had cold or scalding water ,0
 buffet breakfast nice bar area very friendly staff and got a room upgrade with a good view and a great little coffee maker,1
 only one staff was serving in the so called four star hotel impolite disrespectful ignorant of the savoir vivre manners in addition the safe was not closing and we had to carry our stuff with us all the way the bathroom was horrible my little daughter was about to literally break her leg in the bathtub they do not have cap showers nor slippers the list is endless ,0
 manager not helpful due to circumstances in paris at time his way or no way booking com not helpful either ,0
 i have paid for the reservation during checkin and when i got my credit card bill there was an extra charge of 183 6 pounds whitout my authorization suposely they didn t charge for the first night when during the checkin so they decided to charge my credit card again whithout tell me or ask for my authorization which is an absurd how come a hotel like this forget to charge this amount and decide by themselves to use my credit card whithout my authorization this is an absurd i have asked the hotel for the refound and they said no ,0
 good location also a very clean and comfortable room we will use this hotel again ,1
 the hotel is well located in the legal district of london and within walking distance of major city landmarks such as st paul s cathedral theatres and trafalgar square staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 small room not valued money old and not clean ,0
 check in staff was aggressive check out staff was okay the hotel was not clean at all it was an incedinet and the staff moved my room to a jenour suite the cheif refused in an aggressive way to help preparing a special order for my family as they are allergy from some items ,0
 room had cigarette spoke coming through the air vent toe nail clippings in the corner of room light bulbs not working staff rude in the bar we moved rooms at 10 30pm we will not be returning ,0
 good reception,1
 perfect location nice reseption and concierge,1
 amazing view from the window on the arena from the 14th floor very comfortable bed amazing breakfast selection ,1
 the bed room was small could not move in the short cubicle and also could not open the wordrobe door properly so crunm plus when check in was ask if i wanted breakfast which had to be paid extra and was told that i can t have beacon or ham i ve never heard such rubbish in my life you cater for the clients not for the employee as ian the one who pay the bill it should not allow to happen you should put these thing in your brochure when you advertise then people can choose i for one would have not choose that hotel very disappointed ,0
 good location and private parking,1
 the hotel charged us for a junior suit but in fact the room was smaller than standard the desk staff are extremely unprofessional they charged us twice as soon as we walked in the hotel they were all interested in money and that the residents pay first thing the breakfast in not buffet and ridiculously expensive the manager was rude with no experienced how to treat a client he knew that they were ripping us off regarding extra charge but refused to refund but kept saying that they will upgrade us on our next visit shamble and empty i paid for junior suit and it was in fact smaller that normal rooms i have stayed in dorchester oriental mandarin sanderson st martins lanes etc who charges same price but my lord what a difference in service this hotel is a rip off i will never ever stay there and would recommend to stay away ,0
 great facilities and the club lounge is well worth the extra price staff very helpful and setting and location is excellent ,1
 location room was very comfortable breakfast was excellent staff very helpful with all inquires good advice regarding restaurants etc ,1
 location fantastic,1
 lovely hotel great location staff were excellent polite professional and also a good sense of humour which i feel always helps ,1

 good spacious enough room and bathroom excellent location near earl s court underground station very nice breakfast buffet very good internet facilities with printer access even very nice garden with seating facilities ,1
 room in basement,0
 even though i was overlooking the road my room was very quite,1
 the hotel is not at all at the level of 4 stars ,0
 the first room i was checked into room 7 has a pull down double bed and no bedside lights just very bright overhead room lights this is clearly an old storage room that has been put into service not acceptable as a room to sleep in when paying over 100 per night even in london with no breakfast felt like someone s closet overlooked airconditioning units and service pipes outside next room they placed me in was a bit dusty and you could clearly hear the tube line underground near by every 4 6 minutes and the noise from the internal 24 hour bar but i was too tired by that time to care 8am sharp the next morning jackhammers on the next door wall next door building made everything in the room rattle and the noise was unacceptable levels without ear protection i called the manager into the room to experience the sound she admitted that she did not realise it was so bad they honestly should not be allowed to use that room while the construction takes place next door i had work to prepare for a meeting that morning the manager showed me their business centre which is a closet sized room with one monitor and a printer but was occupied for hours in the main lobby there are couches but with 3 cleaners vacuuming at 8 9am they moved me to a third room that night while i was out at work this was at the other end of the building upstairs it was cold but ok i could hear the jackhammers again at 8am the next morning but they were a manageable sound level although outside bin collections etc were very noisy the hotel is in a lovely old building but it is clear that the owners do not care at all about their guest s comfort there is a lot of internal and external noise and the old rooms have not been properly soundprrofed the bedding carpets curtains are old and dusty the 2 bathrooms that i used had broken shower slides and shower heads that were not very good ,0
 uncomfortable room the bed is less than what is written on the reservation we changed two rooms but the bed was both very small below 150 cm how it was written ,0
 fantastic service and brilliant location,1
 manager,0
 great hotel helpfull staff in a good location,1
 we enjoyed our dinner in the hotel restaurant the location is very handy for westminster big ben and the houses of parliament the southbank of the river thames with its many restaurants cafes and waterloo station for connections to london underground and national rail services ,1
 staff friendly and helpful location excellent beautiful looking hotel and breakfast good,1
 cancelled the buffett by the hotel but still keep the promotions in the room menu its bad experience didnt match the service as five star ,0

 poor service no water no kettle no iron no coffee tea powder kept asking them but no one bother to help over all worst hotel i even stayed,0
 great breakfast comfortable room great location ,1
 the room was too small and far from being well designed the corridors were full of dirty trays that remained there after more than 3 hours the lobby was packed with people looking as if they were camping there the bars looked and were served as cheap bus station shops you feel like being in an improvised post emergency accommodation at some times but at the price of a four star hotel ,0
 for americans used to large they need to think smaller but no less comfortable ,1
 view over thames from our bed was awesome lighting in room was well thought out real coffee machine was a bonus toiletries provided were extensive ,1
 staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean and quiet location on the whole was convenient ,1
 awful breakfast swimming in fat so i had toast instead sausages looked half cooked waited for more to be served out waited 15mins and gave up bathroom was grubby room was like a bedsit stains on the bed worn tired and in need of restoration didn t feel comfortable and wanted to go home tiles were loose in the bathroom hairs hanging down in there mold and try to find the toilet flush is a mystery side mounted how odd ,0

 the day before we arrived i recieved an email to say there had been a mix up and our 1st night was not going to be in the h10 our first night was going to be in the bermondsey square hotel this was extremely inconvient as i picked the h10 for location only despite being advised that we would recieve an upgrade on our room and some extra amenities this didn t happen no real apology from the hotel for the mix up despite me making the booking 4 months in advance nor were componsated for the extra we had to spend getting to and from a hotel miles away from where we needed to be ,0

 good value for money clean near to the underground and the bus stations helpful staff ,1
 location was fantastic rooms were clean with a great view over the thames breakfast was also excellent with a great selection and good service brand new complimentary pool spa facilities were an added bonus ,1
 what the hotel had to offer the quality of the surroundings food and complimentary drink on arrival the room was small but had everything it stated had on the website,1
 i had the worst experience in terms of comfort i have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world the basement room they put me in had faulty ac so was like an oven when i complained they gave me a fan and said there was nothing else they could do it was late and i was extremely tired and had an early start so there was no way i could change hotels at that time i was told there was nowhere else to put me i did not sleep at all the heat was unbearable the next day when i complained i was then offered a cooler a mini ac unit which was not offered to me the night before when i asked to change rooms the manager came to see me and immediately apologised and agreed it was extremely hot and offered to change room the only room available i was told was a smaller room than the one i had paid for it was tiny but at least i could sleep,0
 free up grade to a suite was very unexpected superb view of the london skyline ,1
 no restoran small room breakfast hot trays emty ,0
 i liked how they took care of me i got surprised as well as they have upgraded my room to executive room with a surprise wine for my birthday that s sweet,1
 staff were brilliant so friendly ,1
 i had to be shown 2 3 bedrooms before the receptionist decided he could offer me a better room the first room was a ground floor room with two air handling units running either side of the window making a lot of noise the second room did not have any window at all i cannot sleep without an open window during this saga the receptionist kept telling me that the problem was that some of the guests had decided to over stay i said that having booked this room about a week before this issue was not one that was relevant he also stated a second problem i was staying only one night establishments are free to stipulate a minimum stay if one does not and this one did not they cannot penalise who are staying for one night by confining them to rooms that are unacceptable at this price 182 night in my case after all this i was confronted with a mouse that appeared from under the dressing table the following morning one could not regard this as a good stay ,0
 the beds were so soft and not firm at all so you would sink when you lay on them i am small person and in weight so it s definitely not me the bed was exceedingly small in size and not representative of normal hotel bed sizes the doors on the bedroom do not do much to block out the sounds of the hotel hallways and you can hear each and every guest or staff walk past your room the bathrooms were small and only had showers in them the hotel only gave 1 large towel per room which i thought odd and not standard hotel policy for london ,0
 very old definitely not 4 4 1 2 star,0
 the room in the basement is a scam will suggest everybody to avoid this hotel,0
 clean and comfortable ,1
 expensive taking into account the location poor and expensive breakfast bad coffee,0
 breakfast in the morning bread stale meats cheeses out for over an hour not kept refridgerated breach on food safety standards coffee luke warm in the flask,0
 the hotel has air conditioner in all the rooms and the rooms were clean and tidy everyday the stuff were really nice and the location wasnt that far,1
 rooms were appalling for the price asked even a 2 star would be cleaner crazy price for a dilapidated room reception staff knew the problem and did nothing in the end downgraded to get a clean room ,0
 room keeping at 8 30am ,0
 staff are not helpful at all,0
 situation impeccable,1
 very small room poor service,0
 very clean and comfortable room great belgo restaurant downstairs if you only are fan of belgian beer everything as it should be in a good hotel ,1
 the gym pool beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious near to everything like shopping bus and metro ,1
 overall the room was fantastic the bed was extremely big and very comfortable we enjoyed being able to connect our phones to the tv to play music the sky bar on the 18th floor was beautiful and the cocktails were delicious we had a great view from our bedroom across london and enjoyed watching the sunrise in the morning ,1
 flexibility staff very eager to please quiet area near to lancaster gate tube and hyde park where we had a great morning having coffee and cakes at the lido cafe also enjoyed the traditional london sing song at the duke of kendal pub on sunday night handy for the 205 bus which took us all the way to kings cross much easier than the tube ,1
 we got 2 twin beds so small they can fit a child the first night was terriable barely slept in these small bed the second night they arrange the sheet that the two twin beds connected to one even thohgt the beds are very un comfy the balnket are uncomfly as well very bad experince for 5 stars i don t know how they got 5 starts he breakfast are very dull as well above all they couldn t fix the heater it was extermely hot in the room ,0
 the room is too small and the room in shutesbury is at basement ,0
 lovely unusual architecture quirky odd shsped bedroom,1
 bed was very comfy room clean great location for the apollo and tube station would stay there again,1
 everything,0
 my requirements were ignored leaving my travel companion staying in the room i booked but given the light respiratory health issues allergies the bathroom smelling of cigarettes and the room being cramped left me with the an option not to stay at this hotel did not want to go through the frustrating conversations at reception but would not stay again definitely not value for money paid given the room on a ground floor where you can barely move around in and a smell of cigarettes in the bathroom ,0
 the location,1
 the location was perfect for access to the notting hill carnival the bed was really comfortable despite the cosy room size the staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 the cleaning was not done daily and when i called in at reception to complain i was received with rude comments by the person that answered the phone the linen was not changed daily and empty bottles were not put away in the bin the restaurant was constantly closed yet it was said they open until late the door key kept not working or had some form of dysfunction to it ,0
 breakfast was expensive an the room was small,0
 the staff rudeness was the most horrible experience in particular during check out i requested late check out at 1pm instead of 12pm one hour i was almost threaten to be charged 20 pound per hour if i didn t leave now the experience was horrible and rude the floor is not renovated floor 7 very old style and room is very small to the extended that you will hit your feet finger every time you move elecricty plug are designed in wrong places no place for bages toilets took age for flushing refill mini bar is empty so if you request water they will charge you 5 pound delivery the price for this rook is too much,0
 the hotel was in great location next to hyde park excellent reception lounge and bar area full of character and even a claim to have been bought for lily langtree to perform for her king immaculately clean room very comfortable and modern albeit rather small breakfast was included and was very good served in a beautiful dining room ,1
 breakfast was poor and very disorganised not enough seating for everyone,0
 first time in london and the hotel was fantastic we were given a free upgrade to twin room with double beds shower was hot and powerful staff were extremely helpful and professional at all times room service was quick and food was hot the breakfast was varied and plentiful i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone ,1
 the rooms were lovely and the beds were so comfy great location as we was going to a concert at the o2 and the walk way to the hotel took 3 4 minutes ,1
 the staff were ultra friendly and ultra helpful small things like best place to eat adapter for electric socket ,1
 we really liked the breakfast there was a wide choice of food the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with many good quality restaurants it is also close to the subway station ,1
 the whole place ,0
 the bathrooms are flooding the tv didn t work always have to ask for reparation and innovation in building next to hotel did not let us sleep and rate of room was too high,0
 was charged for two full breakfasts and severed a single egg on toast which wasn t great the fridge in the room and air conditioning made a lot of noise even when the the air con was turned off staff we impolite and inflexible in the morning i wouldn t stay here again ,0
 everything staff were excellent facilities were impressive and the hotel is so clean and relaxing very quiet and a terrific location ,1
 comfy bed,1
 bar area is excellent barman looked lonely though hire him a friend staff on desk very helpful,1
 the location was good few minutes walk to waterloo station the kitchenette was very useful microwave side space in the fridge and cutleries room was a good size separate sleeping area for the kids ,1
 staff were not friendly and the rooms smelt of damp,0
 the small double room is shockingly small even by london standards do not stay in this hotel if you are claustrophobic the decor is a little tired and room service was a disaster luckily i was only booked in for one night for business but i would not go back the reception staff seemed to be in training and therefore checking in and out took a long time ,0
 the room was extremely small electrical wire showing in the bedroom bare wires in the shower room plumbing extremely noisey unable to sleep after 5 30 in the morning ,0
 the staff were attentive professional and so happy especially valentina and atila i hope i remembered their names correctly the christmas decorating was beautiful ,1
 location,1
 the reservation hasn t been done when we arrived and they said that the just saw it now the room was not as expected in the pictures it s look better very little space the bed was uncomfortable it was a twin bed for a couple it s not so nice the cleaning hasn t been done when we been back to hotel and never well done the next day when we call at the reception for that matter they said they can t do anything will have to wait tomorrow to talk with the housekeeper the door room like they don t have any maintenance till 10years ,0
 location and friendly staff good view of london eye and houses of parliament from our room on the 11th floor,1
 shower flooded into room and corridor nobody around when we arrived late car park wasn t open there were two of us sharing the room second bed was poor ,0
 the room was super warm on arrival and the aircon was so slow the tv remote had no batteries and we waited for 15mins for someone to help us the towels were old and crusty and the bed sheets had stains for 200 per night it was a very over priced hotel should of offered us some form of apologise ridiculously priced starbucks and the breakfast in the morning was horrid no food stocked up the tables a mess and not wiped and the waitress took over half an hour to deliver my eggs my partner had already eaten his breakfast by the time my eggs arrived to the table overall we won t ever recommend or go back to the hotel ,0
 the room was very clean as was the bathroom the bathroom has a separate shower with 2 shower heads and a bathtub big welcome on the flatscreen the room has a big glass wall and being on the 13th floor the view was nice at breakfast coffee tee gets served at the table and staff was attentive enough to fill my waterflask with cold water the free internet connection was good above average video call and streaming tv was good no lag ,1
 had to move rooms after the first night then on the second night we were gave a key to someone else s room and woke them up staff didn t really know what was going on and it took about 40 mins to check in,0
 we love this hotel we love the rooms location and enjoy being able to use the gym facilities in the morning ,1
 excellent location friendly staff ,1
 very friendly personnel very nicely furnished decorated all new and perfectly finished outstanding location internet connection was extremely fast,1
 thoughtfulness of staff fabulous room and amazing cocktails in the tempus bar,1
 bed comfortable staff very friendly location super early breakfast in the room is very convenient when you are in a hurry like i was ,1
 the staff were all really lovely ,1
 arrived at the hotel to be informed that the boiler was broken so moved to the park hotel paddington court excellent hotel amazing staff room upgrade too ,1
 reception were not very polite bed sheets never get changed unless you ask they don t take garbage from the room you have to ask them to clean bed is not comfortable for this price it s 1 star beds,0
 everything ,0
 everything especially the free upgrade which they always try to do ,1
 the room was appalling forget the pictures on the website the twin room was so small you couldn t swing a cat and housed in the wing accessed via two lifts and a route march all the hallmarks of a larger room that had been split into a smaller one to sweat the asset curtains fitted into the window recess and not the outside result light flooding in at any time this is a capital city hotel for goodness sake the lights never dim outside no room between the beds and very little down the sides a standard lamp in one corner that you walked into every time you walked around the beds an office chair that couldn t come out from under the desk because the foot of the bed was too close you entered the room and walked straight into the side of the wardrobe full entry required negotiating a dog leg movement a mini fridge housed in the wardrobe that couldn t be accessed unless you opened both wardrobe doors a life expired tv an en suite so small that the sink was an arm rest when sat on the lavatory the hotel was booked because my daughter was undertaking a theatre experience in the west end and in particular the apollo victoria theatre whilst the theatre experience was wonderful this room really took the shine off what an end to a hard working day sleeping in a rabbit hutch ,0
 rooms and public areas furbished to a very high standard the most comfortable beds we ve slept in at an hotel breakfast offered the largest choice of cereals fresh fruits pastries cold meats cheeses and freshly cooked full english probably the best breakfast selection we ve had anywhere location next to the o2 was a bonus as we were attending a show there ,1
 cooperation from the front desk staff specially by ms celine girault ,1
 staff a bit rude rooms not very clean lacking some facility would never stay there again,0
 the staff were very welcoming and helpful the room was great it was very comfortable and clean the restaurant was excellent and we throughly enjoyed out meal there the location is fantastic for seeing a large area of central london by foot but is equally great for access to the tube at westminster ,1
 my room 11 was extremely noisy on street level with no adequate isolation and street light came into the room ,0
 the room we were offered standard double was nothing like that advertised paid for superior double no bath no view in fact no window i can only describe the room as a converted broom cupboard i am very dissapoibted with both the hotel and your booking system which is extremely misleading at least when marketing this hotel ,0
 bfast room nice and warm and breakfast was excellent a faster toaster would help good idea of coffee in a pot kept coffee warm while eating ,1
 the fact that i paid extra for a view and got a building site outside which woke us up at 7 30am on saturday morning to start work the old deco and furniture the thin walls between rooms ,0
 the views were great as was the proximity to the 02 the staff were all very attentive ,1
 i travelled with my wife on arrival we were not given the room that we had booked first night was not very comfortable but the management were very apologetic and very helpful thereafter ,1
 met with a smiling face at reception which continued with happiness amongst all the staff from bar and restaurant ,1
 opulent surroundings and friendly helpful staff the tempus bar brings added luxury with its leather wood paneling and wide selection of drinks great location for soho and covent garden we loved every minute of our stay we will definitely return ,1
 overall a good experience all of the staff were courteous and hard working to find fault would be picking holes but there are little improvements that can be made but overall a great place to stay made better by the staff ,1
 efficiency of booking procedure secure parking facility efficiency of staff ,1
 it was a box room under the stairs with no windows and 2 tiny single beds,0
 pleasant front desk staff,1
 tiny room dirty floor dirty toilets shower head full of limescale dirty table stove and toaster tatty no lift or phone to contact reception very disappointed misleading website ,0
 modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the london eye great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area clean and suitable rooms ,1
 very small and cramped room,0
 i liked the second room i got moved to and the food was very nice ,1
 the staff were appalling our room wasn t ready we were told to go back in an hour and two and a half hours later it still wasn t ready no one was bothered ,0
 like a cloud,1
 bed very comfy lovely view from room lucky enough that staff gave us upgrade,1
 room size and cleaniness,0
 the room wasnt comfort for 4 stars,0
 this was bought for a christmas present along with the theatre room was disappointing was told that the hotel was busy and was put in a tiny room went to breakfast and was told that breakfast was not included and even though we said it wasthe staff still said it wasn t and had to go to our room to get the voucher to show them the staff were not apologetic at all,0
 it took a while to check in this process needs updating the hotels needs a refurbishment the room service menu is not great and few close restaurants i would advise dinner before checking in after a long day ,0
 lovely hotel fantastic location for us excellent customer service at reception i had forgotten to print off concert tickets lovely receptionist went out of her way to help me print them,1
 location and the quiet space,1
 i was given a room close to the lifts elevators so i could hear loud steel like noise every time one of the lifts elevators passed my floor and the noise levels decreased only around 3am and started again at 6 30am the room was very dirty dust everywhere including dusty bed linen dirty carpet sticky remote control brown smears on bathroom walls mold near the bathtub and stained bathroom floor the tea making facilities cups not washed properly the kettle was covered in white residue i raised the issues with hotel reception staff and i was offered no help nor an apology i got in touch with the customer services but they have never replied to my email it was traumatising experience and do not recommend britannia hotel in docklands to anyone ,0
 great location rooms fantastic and they upgraded me to a suite it was huge when i an going to london i am always stay here ,1
 i stayed for 4 days on the end of november staff was nice room was clean and good as i asked for a window with good air because i have severe dust allergy and i m very impressed the breakfast by room service was good and on time bus stop and subway aren t far from accommodation it s valuable to stay in paris if i came back which i will i ll stay in this accommodation again ,1
 comfort including bed one lift operating during all 5 days,0
 excellent value near metro and bus stops within easy reach of all tourist,1
 not at all a 5 hotel free shuttle service is unreliable shower kept going from hot to cold irons in room arent steam irons so are useless awful location and rooms look out onto builders yards would not recommend ,0
 loved the comfort in the room lovely bathroom and spacious in room,1
 not cleaned well burned through holes in bed covered with a pillow the tv remote control was covered in stains and dirt i accidently got some crumbles on the floor next to bed on my first night and throughout 5 nights of my stay they didn t get cleaned vacuumed away imagine what else is on that carpet from previous guests ,0
 they couldn t qoute on their preferred taxi service felt like they was taking advantage of tourists booking com website incorrect on distance to the shard further than suggested i work in the bedding industry the mattress was old and uncomfortable would have had a better nights sleep on the floor should have stayed at premier inn ,0
 the breakfast was lovely and the staff were very helpful and professional ,1
 reception staff were excellent and friendly,1
 the staff were excellent though the breakfast lady was a tad trunchball ,1
 big room,1
 beautiful bathroom really comfy bed views over the thames drinks in both bars with magnificent views great breakfast,1
 the beds vere hard and unplesant the rooms old and need a renovation the staff in the bar did not know what a frozen cosmopolitan was and they did not give u time to look at the bar meny they wanted to take ur order the minutt you sat foot in the bar not good at all the hotel was to expensive all in all ,0
 very rude so didn t check in and just left after cancelling my booking ,0
 the furniture,0
 good location,1
 great location within easy reach of tube friendly staff and very clean,1
 very friendly staff always willing to help great room and location ,1
 room too small and only a shower for that price is not acceptable loads of work going on so very noisy ,0
 disappointed with position of room felt like we were in a basement hairs on towels,0
 the bedroom was tiny not enough room for me and my husband to move around the room at the same time toilet was in the shower room which had heavy limescale on the floor and mould in the grouting no hand basin in the toilet had to go into the bedroom to wash hands air conditioning noisy and not efficient glass door to toilet so at night had to turn light on and lit up bedroom mini fridge was very large noisy and had a glass door which lit up room at night terrible hotel,0
 too much street noise in the room even though i was on a higher floor double glazing old and useless the hotel is in my view old and tired and needs refurbishing the gym was small old and with more than 1 person inside impossible to train the breakfast queue was like being back at school the club lounge was very small and had an american group tour in there so nowhere to sit and very little canap s and food drinks average i complained on my last day about the internet they just kept putting me on hold on the phone listening to some random music i asked to speak to the manager after 4 attempts to connect he spoke to me and said he would come and take a look never turned up disgraceful you don t get loyalty points if you didn t book direct so i have removed myself from their reward program program and informed them i would never stay in any of their properties anywhere in the world and i constantly travel ,0
 great location super close to les halles short walk down to the river loads of cafes and restaurants nearby aircon fantastic suite s balcony was fantastic hotel staff super nice rooms comfy good night sleep ,1
 recently renovated property where fixtures falling off into your hands obviously need to be repaired seemed to be forgotten staff not really carring restraurant is boring big difference in service with its sister hotels ,0
 it was all terrible from the delay in checking in to changing the beds into two singles which i had requested the room was smaller than what was stated on the website the bed was uncomfortable and hard the plug in sockets were scattered unevenly around the room which was irritating when trying to plug somthing in the bathroom was vile the size was absolutely tiny and the bathtub was dirty and slightly grimy later during my stay i was watching television and i get a knock on the door from security saying there s too much noise in the room the television was not even loud the cheek and basic disrespect from staff was terrible disturbing ,0
 great location and late check out was good ,1
 very comfortable clean and excellent value ,1
 we booked a junior suite for quite an expensive rate and got a small dark room 1sr floor looking to the trash in the back yard we then complaint and got the same room in the sixt floor i just booked this hotel due to the great reports on booking com but having been there people must have been crazy or stayed another hotel i would not go there again there are many more hotels in paris with a better offer ,0
 stayed 4 nites room was not completed by housekeeping most days forgot to make the bed one day replenishing amenities was spotty breakfast chaotic staff seemed willing but perhaps not well directed porridge was curious but not good and coffee access required much patience no how was your stay at checkout leading me to surmise that my criticisms would not be helpful also suggest hotel closer to an underground station if that matters to a potential guest ,0
 amazing stuff most especially yasmina she was very helpful and understanding ,1
 everything,0
 helpful staff brilliant location comfortable huge bed ,1
 the first room that we went in we had to reject due to mould and dirty bathroom the second room was very hot as the heating was on constantly and you could not regulate the radiators as there were no valves overall the rooms looked shabby and unclean ,0
 excellent location friendly staff and very clean,1
 excellent location for business or pleasure,1
 excellent staff and clean comfortable room would stay again ,1
 cleaner walking in our room at 9 30 am without knocking clearing our breakfast when we hadn t finished due to a pork allergy not much alternative room looking tired,0
 the hotel made assumption for check out without notice make my room unavailable ,0
 the public toilet areas were very smelly told staff twice but they ignored it i was there 2 days and no one sorted it out,0
 fridge so loud it woke me up light not repaired despite being reported,0
 the worse experience ever in a hotel in my life hotel under construction no main entrance no lobby no reception poor elevator no room cleaning no room service noise from workers in the corridors poor room we reserve our rights for further action,0
 1 staff always helpful in terms of directions to places to visit hiring us a van for our moulin rouge show and trip to the airport sorting our very late dinners from restaurant next door 2 decor i am a lover of cacti and this place had an awesome display,1
 good location tube station near by,1
 lovely location,1
 beautiful newly renovated room bed was bliss bathroom was great with rainhead shower and nice toiletries quiet room with blackout curtains loved the desk which has power points and usb connections reception staff were very welcoming and helpful,1
 good price for a single room,1
 the room smelt of food actually the hotel was mis sold by booking com i will never use your site again ,0
 this hotel is in a dangerous area our room was left open by cleaner luckily never had all our stuff stolen the community needle bus pulled up outside and all the local prostitutes got on to get their condoms needles and blood pressure check there was a lot of dodgy activity and noise all night and we were nearly mugged avoid this property at all costs it s just not worth the risk ,0
 it was a greate hotel,1
 unhelpful staff late allocation of room which resulted in a missed dinner appointment the room should have had sky tv it didnt the bath was rusty the tiles were stained used the fact that i booked through booking com that the room was not correct ,0
 it was comfortable,1
 decor is dated guests not worthy of the business district,0
 i was actually moved to the paddington court location a block away from the london paddington still park grand chain i appreciated a modern comfortable well designed room that met all my needs even though it was tiny that s just london short walk to either paddington or lancaster gate stations in a very nice neighbourhood away from the tacky side of paddington i would definitely return here in the future ,1
 hallways need painting and serious work actual rooms need repair also,0
 no tea making facilities very shabby furnishings poor maintenance lamps not working,0
 rude staff tiny rooms that look nothing like the photos dirty room found a beetle in the towel,0
 location ,1
 great location for a concert at the hammersmith apollo and easily accessible for the underground,1
 cannot fault this hotel or its staff in anyway they are all very courteous polite so very helpful it was a pleasure staying at the hotel ,1
 the staff were friendly and polite the location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of london easily there were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance ,1
 warm and responsive service when requests were made excellent breakfasts ,1
 the room was appalling,0
 i forgot to take pictures of breakfast room as we didn t go back in after the first disaster of a breakfast omelette was cold and i ve seen thicker pieces of paper even the receptionist said she wouldn t eat it tables were wonky i asked for 2 poached eggs on toast and had to do my own toast and eggs were cold we were not the only ones unhappy,0
 great location close to west end st paul s and the thames very comfortable room and helpful staff ,1
 breakfast was excellent we had an unfurnished room but it was in great condition staff friendly,1
 free wifi friendly staff choice to pay in euros,1
 staff were very friendly and approachable beautiful hotel,1
 the kitchenette was great for travelling with children great location ,1
 great stuff good location near the metro station,1
 room not like photo,0
 room was so small for 75 it was like a broom cupboard should not be allowed and customers should be warned before they book and pay up ,0
 the room was superb i d struggle think of anywhere that was better value for money for such high standard accommodation in central london ,1
 i am very unhappy with the stay we had here we checked in for a night s sleep and the room was right by the dlr stop so it was really noisy nobody told us this and we only managed to sleep between 1am 5am when the dlr wasn t running my partner tried to get us moved when we checked in but they fobbed us off then i called angrily at 5am and they moved us but the new room was dirty and also noisy awful stay i complained and got nowhere my 8am meeting was a shambles as i was so exhausted at least places like premier inn have the good night guarantee so if you don t sleep they refund your money i asked about this and was fobbed off by the staff at the hotel terrible place dirty noisy rooms and rude unattentive staff ,0
 our room view was great,1
 loved the lay out and design of the hotel ,1
 magnificient hotel fantastic location beautiful architecture nice bar great english breakfast in a gorgeous stylish room,1
 upon arrival yheir sytem could not accept my master card which was the same as i made the booking with the same afternoon i retrieved money from the atm with the same card i produced another card a platinum master card which was also rejected by their system then i gave them my amex gold card which they accept the same happened the next day i still could not pay with my master cards it also happened to an american couple who checked out the same time as i did what if i had not shown up they would have certainly charged my master card i feel i m being manipulated and i will never stay in this hotel again ,0
 solo traveller tv didn t work whole time i was there had breakfast option only one morning out of three did i try to have breakfast and was simply told we are full no attempt to accomodate me they have done pre authorised transactions on my card 4 times so currently in addtion to the bill being paid i currently have another 290 of my funds in my bank account currently reserved by them which i will not get back for another 7 working days,0
 unfortunately due to my cat being really ill requiring feeding v small amounts every 2 hrs the hotel would not allow us to postpone our visit no empathy whatsoever ,0
 i felt like there were many hidden charges if you were to have breakfast even though breakfast was included with offer ,0
 this isn t a 4 star hotel and was very disappointed the fact that pre payment is taken doesn t give you an opportunity to negotiate on the quality of the hotel and stay ,0
 the nespresso machine and free coffee pods in the room were great shower was amazing buffet dinner was excellent great views of london eye and shard from top floors ,1
 no staff at check in but long queue of people premises being renovated so everything looking shoddy,0
 do not stay in this hotel the hotel charged me three times for one night stay i emailed many times ask for refund and the hotel just ignored my email and no reply at all,0
 room was too small to be sold as a triple room no space left for luggage after the third bed we had to rearrange the beds to make space for luggage losing the cabinet which also was not adequate for three ,0
 i tried 2 rooms both were shabby and in need of upgrade to achieve 4 the bar lacks some basic items the car park is littered with hotel paraphenalia eg chairs etc ,0
 the bath and shower room was amazing beautiful hotel they are going through a refebishment at the moment and i am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which i think will look even more stunning then the building is already,1
 great restaurant bar very green area you dine literally in the park great place for morning run,1
 never trust park plaza staff with your credit or debit card i was having payments taken from my account 3 times days after i checked out i had to call my bank and tell them to block park plaza from taking any further payments fraud is something i don t wish to experience while enjoying a night away from home ,0
 attention to detail,1
 very nice room and also the location good,1
 all facilities are badly maintained air conditioning noisy and even broken down first night called for help several times but took 12 hrs for someone to confirm the air conditioning is not working then it came with no hot water and we ended up using other room for shower at midnight not even a word of apology from any hotel staffs all staffs did not smile at all this is the first time i receive such a poor service from hilton i would not recommend this hotel to any one ,0
 outdated room fittings and poor cleanliness basic facilities like tea coffee kettle missing ,0
 the location is fantastic beside two tube stations 3 lines lots of restaurants and cafes very convenient for the centre,1
 excellent service,1
 i didnt like a lot about hotel i don t recommend any family with kids to go there i asked for a cotton bed and they brought it at 10pm and it was dirty horrible is like sleeping in the floor no matters i took it back and the little one sleepet with us rip off,0
 a lot of thinks ,0
 the reception stuff was not good enough they don t know how to treat their guests ,0
 very nice hotel clean and stylish and very helpful staff ,1
 the rooms are old and not as per pics the 5 start rating is overrated and i will never stay there again the toilets are like 2 stars and i waisted my money paying for a suite and only got 2 chairs and a bed ,0
 no compimentry water minibar way overpriced parking costs to high,0
 excellent location with 2 tubes handy lovely breakfast very helpful staff who for us went the extra mile where our son was concerned as he had ridden the london race and his bike got taken care of and fruit provided very willingly ,1
 lovely hotel with nice furnishings and a courtyard for sitting out in the evenings good breakfast too ,1
 everything was an absolute disappointment to the point i had to change hotel in the middle of my stay this is far from being a 4 stars hotel wouldn t even give one star it s dirty old noisy the breakfast is terrible wifi is poor and they were doing works i would not recommend this hotel at all and i strongly recommend that if the work are for renovation that they close the hotel during renovation because it is a shame ,0
 beautiful traditional hotel,1
 good location stylish designed room awesome breakfast,1
 very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family the hotel has a inside garden beautiful english style where you feel relax with a glass of beer it s very close to the earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night we like this hotel ,1
 location location location and nice simple everything you need rooms,1

 bedroom very comfortable food in the tempus restaurant very good,1
 quiet area,1
 we decided to have an evening meal in the aroma restaurant a set price buffet including three course we tried it and it was superb we will definately eat there again plus it was my wifes birthday and they upgraded our room to an executive wow very much appreciated ,1
 the entire staff was exceptional location ideal and rooms comfortable the staff went above and beyond to provide us with every comfort and kindness during our stay in particular razvon at the front desk was top notch in every way imaginable the accommodations were excellent but razvon s warm hospitality took the experience to the next level i highly recommend this beautiful historic and gracious hotel ,1
 the bed was really comfy location was great right next to eventim apollo ,1
 buffet breakfast was disgusting scrambled eggs where like porridge apple juice was not apple juice it tasted full off sugar and colouring over all bad way to start the day rooms had 3 steps in them it says they have wifi on there web page it dosent say you have to sit in the foyer for free wifi or pay 7 pound per device in your room ,0
 service,0
 location excellent staff very helpful chocolates in the room when the receptionist found out it was my partners birthday really good experience ,1
 staff were lovely reception sent a card and a box of chocolates up for my birthday room service food was fantastic and nice cocktails served in the bar room wasn t the biggest but had everything we needed very clean and lovely bathroom too ,1
 the staff were friendly and helpful we received a complimentary upgrade the room was fab spacious and comfortable the breakfast was really good second stay here would definitely return again ,1
 parking blicked sink water switching in the shower from cold to very hot,0
 staff were rude and unhelpful we were placed in a basement room that smelt damp and had peeling plaster our view was of some grates that cover the storage heaters the bathroom was very cramped with the shower tray having a crack running through it also the cradle for the shower head was not fitted correctly so it fell off each time you attempted to use it as a responsible guest i had reported these issues so the following morning we were visited by maintenance and cleaning staff from 9am this hotel saw fit to ruin my stay with this behaviour as i had traveled to london for a relaxing time and this was spoilt by their insistence to fixing these issues they could have simply waited until i d checked out to do this if you want to stay in a hotel that completely inconsiderate of it s guest stay at the commodore hotel ,0
 the hotel is a grand old building and this quirkyness has been retained the staff were very helpful the rooms clean and beds comfortable,1
 staff were extremely helpful fixed a thermostat problem when they said they would when we went to the restaurant at 10 30 one night just for dessert it had closed but david restaurant manager ordered room service for us and looked after us brilliantly although hotel was very busy the bedroom areas were quiet and we slept great very comfy beds and pillows breakfast was very good and again the service from staff was spot on the location also worked very well for us ,1
 attention to detail and cleanliness was superb,1
 staff in reception rooms were old and small the aircondition was too loudy i asked for an outlet converter and they told me that it is 22pnds,0
 room was very hot room was very dark and no proper lighting room was in a basement with staff walking past the windows a lot very small bathroom compared to the strangely large bedroom size bed was concaved overall felt like i was staying in a hostel breakfast was like eating in a hospital at 7am i paid 175 for one night of this ,0
 the tiny bed creaked every time i turned over the staff contradicted one another over the car parking facilities rules and regulations a drunk man took me to park my car the receptionist was brash,0
 mice running all over the bar ,0
 super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location i love amsterdam ,1
 200 for a tenny tiny boxroom and i still had to make my own toast in the morning not what i d expect from a radisson ,0
 staff attitude response and cleanliness,0
 very bad and small rooms payment sistem in hotel didn t accept visa electron card but before that when i booked room they accept ,0
 we wanted to eat in restaurant but waiter refused to move two empty chairs to an empty table so we had to go elsewhere had to complain twice about room before the broken cupboard was botched and fridge levelled curtains pulled downoff rail when we arrived in room still not remedied three days later,0
 to have a wider range of pastries actual large not 2 beds put together larger rooms,0
 breakfast was not fresh potatoes the standard fried triangles were stale and over fried pastries were not fresh and gave off a stale taste i m comparing the russell hotel breakfast buffet to that at the euston hilton hotel at upper woburn which was excellent ,1
 hotel was being remodeled not told that they had no air conditioning dirt all over tried to give us a room with a temporary conditioner a 3x3ft box in the middle of the room dirty carpet we hit the stealing they found us a room in another one of their properties told us it was a 5star property called hotel de vigny it was late evening raining so we accepted it new hotel was old dirty carpet rickety elevator good breakfast nice staff we cut our two week reservation short left after one week bookings com should check out properties they promote ,0
 room was simply fantastic ,1
 hotel decoration amazing,1
 the hotel is very outdated it needs a full refurbishment the rooms had an old fusty smell which did not go away when we opened the windows,0
 amazing service great staff the rooms were great and all of my requests were met and exceeded deco is beautiful and location extremely convenient i appreciated the peace and quiet of the location,1
 no suitable food no drink small room unsuitable if not i t savvy very poor value and cold unfriendly atmosphere nowhere to charge phone ,0
 staff are friendly and helpful the hotel is relaxing quiet and close to sights and transport ,1
 check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant far too small when hotel is full especially with families they call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge elevators too slow for number of guests have stayed often in london but this was the least appealing hotel there are certainly many better options ,0
 old furniture and no complimentary water or other items need renovation ,0
 small room air con lack of clean towels no uk tv in room noise,0
 the bed was really comfy and i really liked the duvet ,1
 horrible location loud discotheque right under the hotel not so great breakfast on paper plates and cups the breakfast area is in the reception no soaps in the rooms the separate toilet room is very small overall not worth the price at all ,0
 the rooms was dreadful too hot and stuffy crammed with dreadful furniture that was ruined and a filthy stained carpet the late staff serving a very limited chips or garlic bread was so rude we were shocked ,0
 basic bedroom bed was basically a mattress on a platform across the end of the room sink was in bedroom shower and toilet in prefabricated pod very little storage safe was on bottom shelf very hard to access had to get down on the floor ,0
 i keep deposit 100 uk from that deposit take it all because in our bedroom broken something and reception evaluate that item from deposit 100 uk in fact that item very chip in market not that much cost money ,0
 service was appalling i love france french culture french products history but there is the bad side too this hotel represents that go elsewhere ,0
 food was excellent the staff was fantastic very friendly makes you feel welcome at all time very helpful keep up the good work ,1
 the room was cold and we had problems with the bathroom we asked them to fix the heating 3 times or change the room but they didn t do anything ,0
 bedroom super tiny even for london standards decoration not friendly staff,0
 the reception guy can t even speak english thats the first 4 star hotel i ve experienced with language difficulties have no sense of service and use more than 20 mins to do the check in i still think they charged me twice for the room cause i received the notification from my first card says payment success and they asked me for the second card ,0
 bed was completely knackered to the point that you were falling off the end of it ,0
 excellent location rooms spacious and bathroom also spacious with excellent room facilities very modern rooms which were very clean too staff very helpful and friendly also had activities for children too ,1
 service was very bad the night manager in particular,0
 great location near the london eye waterloo underground station is a 5 minute walk from hotel the hotel was perfect for our group of three sharing a room the room was very spacious and clean the bathroom had both a shower and bathtub which was a bonus the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful i am an american so was very happy to find an ice machine ,1
 rude and dirty staff and servieces,0
 the front of house concierge team were absolutely fantastic from initial greeting to last goodbye this overnight trip was a present for my mum and her friend both of whom are close to 70 they were treated like royalty no question was too much and i feel the whole team including the bar staff in the sky bar went out of their way to make them feel special mum sent me a text to say they felt like vip s and they couldn t sleep because they were so excited the beds were fab the room and view were just perfect and the whole experience was beyond anything we could have imagined i have tweeted three times to the hotel and their ceo to express our gratitude my sister and i staying in march i cant wait ,1
 the overall look of the hotel was friendly and welcoming,1
 friendly respectable staff nice breakfast,1
 great conciergerie beautyful ,1
 for the price it was very basic 189 if not bordering on scandalous it was a twin bedded very small room below ground so no natural light ,0
 bed was comfy,1
 1 room very small if your bmi is greater than 20 you will struggle walls cracked for 100 a night not great sorry i don t like writing this review honestly the room was just the bed and a foot of space to the left bathroom v small sink very small 2 poor selection at breakfast on buffet but cooked breakfast ok 3 some hotel staff very rude although to be fair 2 good,0
 shocking service at the desk very rude member of staff initially put in a twin room both single beds the room had an overpowering bad smell damp all in the bathroom ceiling and tiles complained and asked to be moved and had to upgrade to be able to get a room that didn t smell not what i expects from this brand hilton ,0
 refund charging policy a disappointment won t be booking with this hotel again,0
 the service from start to end the conseige service was very good ,1
 very bad location,0
 brilliant location so close to the tube room was gorgeous and spacious lovely and modern the hotel was quiet and so so clean loved it really made our stay extra relaxing ,1
 first of all the entire floor i was in smelled like weed the entire time of the stay i dont know if someone was smoking and if that is an ok thing there sencond they supposedly are a pet friendly hotel and i took my dog with me there he usually does his business outside but unfortunately during our stay he wasnt feeling well and the first day he peed in the bathrom which i cleaned and also called a cleaning lady to disinfect the small are in the bathroom floor and tiped her 10 two days later i drank an orange juice from their minibar and i started to get nausea and chills so i went to the hispital for 2 hours therefore i couldn t take the dog with me so i left him in the room with toys and food and water the dog had pooped in the bathroom on a towel for which they did not only charged me 150 euros but also took the liberty to take photos of the room which is a tootal violation of privacy not only the room but also the dog and my things needles to mention they are theifs and dont give change back they value the city tax as they please not as the law has it basically avoid going there becouse they will for sure find smth to take the warranty money away from you and also dont go if you do not want to be overcharged for weed smelling small cubicles and according to the cleaning staff they change the sheets every 2 days which is really unprofessional they still owe me the change from the first payment of the hotel which the recepsion lady refused to give ,0
 nothing,0
 been locked out when coming back at night the breakfast bath looked like it had never been cleaned ,0
 great staff very thoughtful and friendly this is a very professional operation ,1
 location is superb underground next door classy hotel ,1
 twin room wasn t ready but easily upgraded to a studio good views of the shard on our side ,1
 the room was terrible could hardly move in it some one was smoking in one of the adjacent rooms and the smell of the smoke wafted in to our room i won t be using this hotel again ,0
 the hotel is in dire need of renovation my room was shabby and the carpet dirty the bathroom was in a very poor state and the shower woefully inadequate the bed was uncomfortable in the extreme and every spring could be felt through the mattress the walls were paper thin and the noise from the dlr despite the room being on the 11th floor was unbearable making sleep impossible while the trains were running unsurprisingly the staff didn t ask if everything was alright with my stay ,0
 everyone was so friendly and the food was amazing ,1
 everything as should be exellent location very friendly staff smiley faces all over the hotel they offer you the help without asking very clean room luxurious room very comfortable bed taxis available all round clock hyde park corner underground station is next door main attraction in london is in walking distance hyde park green park harrods oxford street buckingham palace marble arch london eye ,1
 the room size is magnificent with super size bathroom made it feel spacious and luxurious had everything we needed with very relaxed and friendly staff everywhere,1
 cleanliness and proximity to transport ,1
 too hot the room not able to reduce it,0
 outside areas staff deco and art,1
 the room was poorly laid out the temperature of the hot water in the shower was hard to control when it seemed to be right it would go cold for short periods ,0
 pleasant staff quaint boutique hotel well located,1
 swimmong pool ,1
 beautiful edwardian building with an interesting history breakfast was great value with plenty of choices for both british and continental ,1
 rooms not cleaned properly no safe or mini bar in room tv not working room table broken no staff on front desk lifts not working properly lifts full of staff and therefore no room for us no toast etc brought to breakfast table ,0
 excellent hotel we last stayed here some 19 years ago and was very impressed then but was even more impressed this time what with the refurbishments that have been done since our last visit the room was very comfortable and the shower is one of the best that i have experienced in a hotel room likewise the breakfast and dining area was too ,1
 i paid for room with breakfast included this was s trip i bought for my son and his girlfriend and both mornings they were questioned as to whether they had paid for the breakfast so hotel experience little spolit,1
 the bed was uncomfortable with a mattress topper covering an old mattress the room smelt damp and the pillows were poor quality i didn t sleep all night due to the road noise ,0
 the room we have been given was to die for the most confortable bed and a luxury bathroom,1
 the hotel was dirty noisy and certainly not value for money,0
 great facilities in the rooms everything was thought of great cocktails in the clipper bar ,1
 as it was just me a real single room was ok and therefore good value the room had all necessary facilities and modern bathroom ,1
 room was pretty small and not what a expected ,1
 how can a place like that get 4 star old and shabby my room was extremely small and very cold normal heating not working had to connect myself an electric radiator see photo bathroom small if you are overweight you will hardly reach the toilet and cold you can only heat it running hot water from the shower no light or mirror for shaving ugly carpet everywhere except bathroom ,0
 everything from start till the end of stay,0
 indian food in restaurant was excellent ,1
 the pillows were amazing so soft never felt anything like them our view was excellent we were greeted before we entered the hotel by a lovely gentleman in a top hat ,1
 the hotel itself you had to enter through a cafe that was unclearly marked in an extremely unwelcoming unattractive area which was also opposite a building site the staff were blunt and too busy serving coffee or looking busy than checking us in the breakfast was an abomination serving cheap value cereal bars a few sad hard boiled eggs left on a plate cold and some stale brioche i would t even call it continental just appalling and not worth the money in the slightest i could have bought the whole of the cheap tesco selection myself the room itself was topped it off by the broken sink and tiles surrounding the basin dirty scuffed shower plate and the sink did not drain properly the walk too the zoo was around 35 40 minutes and the connections a pain for the main tube stations the money for the compact rooms shoddy street and disgusting breakfast is not one i will ever choose to do again ,0
 always a pleasure to stay at this unique and beautiful hotel ,1
 the room was lovely with a view over the park and the staff were very helpful a very pleasant stay ,1
 the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful concierge was excellent nothing was too much trouble ,1
 great location for theatres restaurants and shops friendly helpful staff and lovely breakfast ,1
 amazing view loved the hotel,1
 the staff someone raised their hand on my mother because he was upset it was night and he didnt want to fix the safe box ,0
 beautiful historic hotel central location and very helpful staff rooms are comfortable and clean home from home feeling when we got to our room there was a a lovely complementary bottle of wine waiting for my mum and i such a lovely thought that is why i hope again to revisit this hotel again ,1
 location excellent,1
 nothing ,0
 the rooms are worn and run down the high price seemed to be based on location not amenities ,0
 the location is perfect and easy to access main london attraction ,1
 location and bed comfort and bathroom staff very friendly,1
 rude manager booked a junior suite and was given a room with 2 beds one double and one single despite my booking was for one person please be careful the club room is really very small and the junior suite you see on the website is not representative as they showed me tiny rooms in the basement and they still call them junior seuits with very small seating area i decided to take the club room instead of the junior suits they showed me as they re smelly in the basement very cold floor which was tiled and not carpeted as you see on the website even the club room is small with single chair squeezed in the corner sadly the staff could not see the problem at that time it s not worth it as there are better and cheaper room in the hotels around it which i tried before with more appreciation ,0
 very well situated hotel close to gardette park in a quiet street nice staff all necessary facilities and services are close to the hotel,1
 location friendly staff,1
 lumpy beds 10 minutes to run hot water 1st day concierge moved me out of the way of the lifts for another customer with more bags had 2 meals in the restaurant and both were not cooked properly and waited 15 minutes just to get a drink and a menu ,0
 location and good value for money,1
 room was rubbish clean but very very tired,0
 they have charged me 600 for someone else s booking and still havent refunded me yet when i went to the hotel to query the general manager called the police on me two days later i still haven t had my refund and the none of the managers have even given me a courtesy call email ,0
 rooms could have been a higher standard for money paid requested upstairs room but got given basement took 2 different people to find our booking and this happend at both arrival and check in as we arrived early unable to check n straight away ,0
 newly renovated with nice design good breakfast very good room size ,1
 location of hotel,1
 awesome location very close to queensway tube and bayswater tube shops restaurants convenience stores hyde park bus stop excellent reception and staff although my room was small which is normal by central london standards it was extremely well appointed had everything one would need breakfast was excellent too good spread freshly prepared ,1
 we were told ther was an elevator to all floors when i contacted the hotel prior to booking untrue there is none to the breakfast area when booking com contacted them to seek a refund of our breakfast charge they lied again saying we had not asked for an elevator this is quite upsetting as i am not able to use steps due to a disability ,0
 the staff were lovely and upgraded us to a nicer room because it was my boyfriends birthday to which made the holiday special ,1
 the reception desk was very friendly and helpful the breakfast buffet was tasty will definitely come back ,1
 staff are very helpful and efficient very good service ,1
 basement room dungeon bed was 15 cm too short narrow and small room was tiny terrible value for money totally uninterested reception staff,0
 the staff were friendly and checking in out was incredibly swift room service was great too ,1
 unequal cleanness but strong cleaning products smell all over the place the sink was plugged and it took 3 days and multiple requests to get it unplugged and then it was completely leaking which took another 24 hours to solve 1 hour before i leave besides very noisy no soundproofing at all and a cleaning team which seems to come always at the wrong time but never when you meed ,0
 recently renovated silent and comfortable rooms nice ,1
 location ,1
 great location very nice and helpfull staff clean and confortable room quiet we enjoyed every minute,1
 value for money it definitely wasn t wasn t told swimming and internet was extra staff were not welcoming with exception of the bar man ,0
 the staff at the reception was rude i had checked my account before leaving to go to the hotel and had seen that they had charged me according to the policy i had booked under the receptionist then informed me that this was not the case and that they were going to charge me again constantly telling me the first charge was a pre authorisation he was not willing to listen this was a frustrating and bad start to our stay the rooms are small which i was expecting due to it being in the centre of london but i did not appreciate the fact that the beds were not long enough going to the toilet was pretty much impossible there is no space at all they supply a kettle in the room but the tap in the bathroom is so small that you cannot fill the kettle there we had to use the showerhead not good ,0
 coffe machine in room ,1
 excellent hotel and staff great location for the tube and euston station ,1
 room and bed comfy kept very clean overall our stay was very enjoyable,1
 bed was comfy shower was good ,1
 pictures on web must have taken 20 years ago room i reserved deluxe double room was size of closet so had to upgrade with 20 for each night furniture wooden floor was all scratched and worn out glass door to bathroom does not fully close and see through no privacy at all housekeeper left coffee mug and wine glass not cleaned regret that i trust booking com reviews never again and couple of steps in the middle of hallway if you can t lift your luggage every ten step to get to your room from elevator don t stay here they make you work out by lifting own luggage ,0
 every think this not for star hotel this 2 stars,0
 very helpful and accomodating staff lovely to have a valet to carry my bag to and from my room and get me a cab the concierge desk was very helpful was given free breakfast each day after having to be moved to their sister hotel just a short distance down the street due to a broken boiler in my booked hotel ,1
 the location was ideal,1
 we booked a superior double room that according to the pictures of booking and the hotel website would be light clean and just in general very nice we came in the hotel and this wasn t at all what we had in mind the staff was unfriendly and very bad to understand the room was old small dark en just overall dirty the bed wasn t a kingsize the blanket was too smal for 2 people and the carpet on the floor was discusting the bathroom was far from clean the bathtub had a broken watertap the toilet didn t flush properly ans so on breakfast wasn t in buffet for 15 per persoon we could only get scrambled eggs with some bacon and 1 english muffin overall we are very unhappy we never ever had such a bad experience hotel before this isn t even worth 2 stars i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone they should be ashamed to ask so much money for such horrible rooms we were in london for 1 night only and this really ru ned it for us ,0
 the staff were so helpful and friendly,1
 the courtesy of the hotel staff were great when we arrrived at the hotel we were told that our room was unavailable due to a boiler failure which was a bit of a disappointment but the hotel staff were great and we were told we would be upgraded and receive complimentary breakfast great customer service on the hotels behalf i would definitely stay again the next time we were to visit london,1
 location and modern comfort eg design of room and free phone with apps ,1
 everything was perfect from the room the view and not forgetting the helpfulness of the staff we were given complimentary cable car tickets as the spa was closed for maintenance chauffeur driven unexpectedly to our dinner booking across the river and when we arrived by car to the hotel the ticket machine wasn t working for the car park we notified reception when we checked in was advised they would sort out the fee when we check out thinking they would charge our credit card or something when we checked out we were given a complimentary pre paid ticket free of charge so we could get through the car park barrier again unexpectedly we were there for 2 nights breakfast was also amazing lovely views of the thames eat as much or as little as you want the skybar is lovely too again amazing views was very relaxing with complimentary nibbles we really did feel like vip s during our stay ,1
 great style lovely lobby and salle a manger good deal for the room the small size was fine for us comfortable bed and very quiet very good breakfast we appreciated the dinner recommendation it was very good location was excellent ,1
 the calculation of the fine i did not do it ,0
 lost my original reservation was apparently given a classic double it was truly terrible claustrophobic room overlooking the rear roof damp on ceiling live wires visible in bathroom i mean i would never stay and never recommend to anyone one to avoid i m afraid ,0
 the hotel is excellent and in a great location all of the staff were very friendly and breakfast was very nice ,1
 do not stay at this hotel the photos are completely misleading and it s not at all worth paying for the room we were given was completely outdated and disgusting flooring was damaged panel under sink was coming off the wall and was very dirty smell of smoke throughout corridor completely not soundproof i could hear the rooms next to me as well as above me very clearly and barely slept a wink after a very long journey view from window was of broken trellis and below balcony which has rubbish on it including a dirty spoon overall a very disappointing experience i would categorically never stay here again and would advise no one else to either ,0
 for business travellers there should some drinks in the fridge as they might be arriving and leaving soon no time to go out and find just a bottle of water ,0
 i left a jacket and suit bag behind and francesco was super helpful in tracking it down great bathroom and good pillows ,1
 that definitely is not a 4 star hotel needs a lot of upgrades,0
 staff trying to get you to sign up to their loyalty card gave me the form as well as hotel booking to sign stating please sign these two this is totally unexepytable breakfast at just under 15 not value for money and a complete rip off round the corner better for 5 room extremely small ,0
 we were upgraded our room was excellent and although overlooked waterloo station was very quiet and we had a view of the shard very pleased indeed ,1
 the friendliness and courtesy of all the staff from the check in desk to the dining room staff i loved the comfortable bed the view over russell square gardens the high ceilings and ornate deco and the buffet breakfasts with everything anybody could possibly ask for even me as a vegetarian ,1
 service was good we arrived early and were able to leave luggage room was great good bathroom ,1
 male receptionist left an unpleasant door i was supposedly upgraded to a clubroom the room had the creekest floorboards luckily i was staying alone there was a sound that was vibrating violently above the bed from the ceiling the staff said it was the main boiler and apologised that there was no room change available heck down grade me i just want to sleep at midnight i had to play a sound recorded on my mobile and i was reluctantly moved there was another customer complaining it was quiet floorboard issues again missing board with carpet over the top this is not a 4 ,0
 the staff,1
 i m very disappointed with the offered rooms i booked two rooms months ago still my room was extremely tiny one room of the 4th floor the other on the 2nd very expensive for the price of 209 each i made a complaint at the reception and the manager was not professional indifferent she didn t care i still have a bad taste in my mouth ,0
 the location was ideal being very close to a tube station also being close to hyde park if you like walking the staff were friendly and helpful we had the chocolate and prosecco afternoon tea which was very tasty ,1
 the air conditioning was very noisy so disrupted our sleep as the room was too hot when it was off and this was compounded by the most uncomfortable pillows in the world ,0
 construction work next to the hotel meant lots of noise bed has seen better days springs were coming through the mattress parking is an absolute rip off,0
 the room apparently was an upgrade smelt very sweaty the pillows stank of sweaty heads had to put bath towels over pillows to stop smell slept on top of bed was not risking sleeping in sheets ,0
 i made i mistake and i booked a twin bed and i left a msg saying that it was my weeding day called and told them as i couldn t change it been promised that i will have a nice double room when we arrived the system was down and we been giving separate beds even i told the guy at the reception that we just got married after we went to the room we told him again that we just got married and we don t won t to sleep separated then he gave us another room so i felt bit embarrassed in front of my new weeded wife as well the room didn t look at all as what s on photos ,0
 the room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable the staff were very friendly,1
 the location was very good and staff very friendly and polite hotel very clean and high standards very good for value of money,1
 attention stealing the room money all pack of cigarettes cosmetics stinks of sewage mold in the room ,0
 huge bed comfort after long travel ease of getting into paris central great breakfast clean room,1
 convenient for the station ,1
 excellent value for money we were upgraded to a suite free of charge so found ourselves in a very comfortable modern and exceptionally clean 4 suite for just over 100 staff were very helpful organising a cake for my partner s birthday and although we didn t eat at the hotel the indian food in the bar smelt delicious room service was very reasonably priced too ,1
 location and value,1
 comfortable bed clean rooms spacious rooms goog breakfast free internet,1
 the breakfast and the location,1
 where do we start very disappointed after staying here a few years ago staff had no idea when asked about london twice sent us on a wild goose chase to nowhere they all seemed to be from europe had no idea about london keys to room deactivated every night staff kept blaming us when they worked all day other guests had same problem rooms were extremely ordinary for the price the pillows were disgusting they were all so old i would have put them in my dog kennels at home they were that bad we stayed for 5 nights requested new one s but they were just as bad hotel is very tired for the price only good thing about this hotel is the location but stay around the corner google it as there is a better hotel overlooking the river around the corner worth paying an extra few dollars ,0
 the staff were friendly and helpful particularly the reception and concierges the room was comfortable and had all we needed breakfast as always was very good and generous we like the atmosphere and ambience and it is so well placed for stations concerts etc ,1
 the room was extremely hot and stuffy the air conditioning appeared to be broken and the hotel said that there was no one available to fix it nor were we offered another room the temperature was 32c and we couldn t open the windows this lead to us getting hardly any sleep at all also we were on the 4th floor and there was much noise coming down from the terrace above ,0
 i traveled with my husband and my daughter so we asked for a room with 3 independent beds the room was big enough for the 3 beds and we slept well the location of the hotel is very good close to subway and there is a walk only street near the hotel where we found a lot of interesting restaurants and shops ,1
 an incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room and cohen the receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite excellent hotel ,1
 location and staff excellent,1
 more space just my wife and i packed in room on website rooms appeared much more spacious staff was nice but very difficult to communicate with ,0
 decor,1
 the hotel has very beautiful interiors nice helpful and talkative staff extremely comfortable beds,1
 staff very helpful very comfortable bed great location for our needs ,1
 no bar facilities after 10 30 in the evening very poor for central london unhelpful staff no minibar in room ,0
 great location comfortable single room great night s sleep ,1
 this is the worst stay at a so called 5 hotel i ever had very unfriendly staff small rooms never again ,0
 everything i have been traveling for the past 20 years this was the worst experience ever with all the respect to the staff who is trying to help as much as they can but the hotel condition is spoiling the whole fun ,0
 excellent location beds very comfy breakfast good,1
 the smallest room of my life,0
 we stayed at the apex after a conference i had in london last week the staff at the front desk and the lounge were extremely friendly and helpful the hotel was very modern very clean and very quiet we had a very comfortable stay and will definitely be looking to return to the apex should our travels take us back to london in the near future ,1
 the self laundry service is a saver for family with children and health club spa service is fantastic but quite expensive should make it bit economical ,1
 they come daily to clean the room but they don t change the bed sheets and they keep it for more than a day i have reported the same hotel many times when they come in the morning to check the mini bar they knock the door and open directly without waiting even for 1 second which is veryyyyyyy bad ,0
 the hotel was located very near the hospital we needed to attend and the room was very pleasant and the decor modern and fresh the staff are very competent friendly and the concierges have excellent communication skills and are very helpful ,1
 we have stayed here before and enjoyed our stay however in this occasion there were noisy deliveries and building works through the night the staff neglected to inform us of swimming pool closure throughout our stay and the did not even have the common courtesy to offer any kind of rate reduction staff are dishonest and it is a shame but i will not stay there again a little apology and a discount would have sufficed ,0
 the service was terrible felt as if they were looking down on us because we are a young couple maybe they were seeing to other guests older before us and when we first arrived i had to go down to reception 4 times because they kept making mistakes about our room e g we paid for a double room and they put us in a twin then they forgot to change the key card over to the other room etc also was on the room phone for 15 minutes and got transferred to another hotels phone they also wanted to take 100 out of our account when we arrived in case we had any meals or snacks when we were there ,0
 friendly reception staff and very close to big attractions and local shops also a very nice cafe close by that i would recommend called barbarellas great for breakfast or lunch ,1
 everything was perfect just what i was looking for the room was magnificent the staff were very friendly and helpful it was a nice relaxing stay the breakfast the next day was delicious really filled us up for the day ahead ,1
 the view from our spacious and comfortable room was amazing it added to what was an excellent weekend,1
 concierge service and flexibility to support the guests,0
 massively over priced and very noisy ,0
 the bed was extremely comfortable we didn t want to leave,1
 fantastic location very helpful and friendly staff nothing is too much trouble for them ,1
 the staff were really friendly especially sara we would definitely come and stay here again because of her ,1
 the matress and pillows were exceptionally good best sleep in terms of comfort ever i would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home ,1
 wish i never went i had to ask three times to get my bed covers changed because my young daughter laid some on them and they did not want to change it always yes yes and they come and try to clean it by hand they didnot remove and put a new duvet or bed cover it was so stinky i had to sleep on the mattress and one clean sheet when j got fed up,0
 convenient for us,1
 service n room condition n no space at all not a do le rooms,0
 staff were excellent very friendly and helpful the hotel was 2 mins from the tube station which was excellent,1
 dated rooms shower was hot cold hot cold tv never worked properly view out of window was a concrete square ,0
 how can you be 5 star without a gift shop breakfast is very expensive 15 pounds for an omelette and you don t even get toast or potatoes ,0
 nice hotel with a wonderful backyard good location as it is close to subway in a residential area restaurants close by ,1
 everything,0
 good room and location,1
 the staff was friendly and helpful when making a booking i added a couple of special requests 1 the room to face away from the street and 2 have 2 twin beds when we checked in both requests have been ignored although the concierge could see them in his system so next day after my complaining they readily moved us to another room which again did not satisfy either of the two criteria but was now on the top floor higher up above the street noise go figure i really apreciate the advise i got ftom mohammad to be at the airport earlier it turned out that indeed the lines and the wait at cdg were horrendous there is an ajacent restaurant that serves fine complementary breakfast the staff there is also very friendly for other meals prices are a bit too high for the value another plus is that this hotel is a long walk await from montmartre the beds were very comfortable ,1
 very clean helpful and polite staff nice rooms generally,1
 outdated rooms air conditioning not very easy to manage pictures don t match likeness of the rooms ,0
 perfect location in south west london very serene and close to the tube station about 250 meters many restaurants around and nice walk to hyde park very clean and decent place ,1
 hotel is located in the back street of a row of shops and is very noisy and on top the reception staff is very rude have paid 72 00at checking for two adults as asked by the staff for breakfast but again charged the same saying we are trying to leave without paying the lady was telling us we can leave bad review and they don t care ,0
 loved everything about the hotel other than paying to watch movies great stay will recommend to anyone else ,1
 the inside of the hotel is very classy he staff are friendly and helpful our room was great huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed the hotel is a nice area there is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the heineken experience ,1
 staff,0
 the beds were itchy the hot water for the shower was limited and kept changing hot cold elevator takes ages to reach hotel is dated and to us it was a 3 stars ,0
 excellent service,1
 we checked in on line thinking this would speed things up how wrong was i check in took longer it system not playing well key card reader not working receptionist rebooted system twice what farce then we where upgraded to junior suite like all the corridors room was dark and unwelcoming carpet was on of the most uncomfortable pieces of material i have ever walked on carpet had been ripped and covered in masking tape doors to cupboards and bathroom where tatty from poor maintenance the hotel has a theme of unsung black as standard colour scheme which works if hotel has abundance of natural light to counter the dank appearance this hotel does not have enough that corridors you walked down can t see where your going can t see room numbers easy you walk along this black corridor and you get disorientated where you are loose your way horrible feeling people may like this and other rooms might be different but room 17 was very poor as a junior suite room was not worth the money will never stay here again ,0
 staff was very friendly and helpful and responded quickly to requests and questions the english breakfast was well stocked and a good value for the cost the history behind the hotel was interesting the lobby library and theater bar were beautifully decorated and took us back in time ,1
 brilliant service no hassle left to get on with our trip brilliant location friendly and helpful staff wonderful trip ,1
 great location nice little bar welcoming staff with good service skills ,1
 no ramps no doorman struggled to get 2 cases up the stairs ordinary room ordinary breakfast buffet drab dinning room with no table cloths and unpleasant crockery cutlery very poor service in dinning room all females running around after any men and i had to ask 3 times for an expresso sorry i forgot and it was far from busy lacklustre reception no direction for using phone eg what number for reception had to return to reception twice to get it sorted and then outrageous charges i would give this hotel 3 stars now you are just paying for the location and london prices ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very clean the location was great for getting everywhere ,1
 excellent location near to earl s court tube station great breakfasts ,1
 unfriendly staff and a hotel that could not provide what i had booked cold shower had to use the gym shower ,0

 great location we stayed here for the notting hill carnival which was walking distance very close to the tube staff were all very helpful let us leave our bags in the luggage room come back to get things out of them later staff couldn t do enough nice clean bathroom ,1
 this hotel is completely disorganised one evening i could not even get hold of room service for in house dining even though i contacted the front desk on three occasions the hotel managed to lose my laundry although this was finally delivered albeit late i considered contacting the general manager but thought better of it as i half expected basil fawltey to turn up ,0
 really good location great hotel good sized room and very good value breakfast staff very helpful and friendly ,1
 it was partners birthday the staff put balloons and a card in the room the room was amazing ,1
 extremely small tiny rooms very cold i have been sick since breakfast is not included if booking is done through booking com,0

 the location size of room cleanliness facilities all top notch ,1
 interior doing rooms are dark elevators slow during rush feels dated ,0
 hotel confortable friendly staff ,1
 the hotel was oversold and our room had been given away so we were put in a partially constructed room with loose wiring hanging from the wall we had reserved a room for our family of three but got only one double bed there was no soap the temperature was too high and there was no way to turn it down because the loose wiring was what should have gone to the thermostat the front desk congratulated us on getting a newly refurbished deluxe room it did not seem like they were trying to be ironic we did get moved to a normal room on the second day ,0
 food was all totally perfect fresh tasty not being sitting around drying out or overcooked we were all most impressed we had all just come back from trips to france scandinavia denmark and copenhagen this hotel far exceeded our expectations the staff are really attentive and on the ball ,1
 exactly placed for our visit,1

 location,0
 there was a huge party happening the room next door until 7am i told reception repeatedly but nobody told them to be quiet they were also smoking in their room it was disgusting i couldn t have had a worse night sleep,0
 given old smelly room staff gives promises without delivering them connected doors are open between rooms dirty toilets worst hotel stayed in definitely not a four star hotel not even worth 3 8,0
 bed was comfortable room was spotless facilities good room with iron etc provided ,1
 very good breakfast friendly stuff and perfect location,1
 i had inadequate heating in my room and lacked the ability to resolve the situation very very poor service and response to my complaint rooms haven t been decorated for 10 years ,0
 bed was uncomfortable and wasn t worth 100 a night,0
 looks very tired and needs a refresh in the room the room was very small double bed and a small single way too expensive for what you get not good value for money would not recommend,0
 a hotel got lessons to learn we booked two rooms one of them room703 didnt have a hair dryer we asked our friends to bring the hair dryer from their room701 for us to use then left the hair dryer in room703 and checked out at9 30 but we came back to pick up luggage at 12 00 the hotel charged 30 pounds for the missing hair dryer of room701 which was actually in room703 and they didnt ask any thing about the missing hair dryer when we were back to get our luggage but just charged 30pound with no excuse after we left ,0

 check in staff very friendly lovely room we were upgraded to a suite as our room was not ready great location for the o2,1
 we had absolutely no hot water and the staff were aware there is none when we checked in but failed to tell us there was still not hot water the following morning and only received 50 refund after a lot of complaining and arguing the minimum expectations of a hotel ,0

 amazing breakfast and brunch ,1
 breakfast is dodgy you have to pay ten pounds for the english breakfast which is not clearly informed by the receptionist or stated in booking confirmation it s a little surprise the poker faced breakfast receptionist handed you a bill to sign without saying anything ,0
 beautifully designed hotel very comfortable staff were friendly and helpful,1
 we enjoyed the beautiful building and the comfortable lounge area as well as the variety of eating areas great location ,1
 room tiny beds tiny wifi was awful,0
 not worth it bad location,0
 service correspondant la classification de l etablissement,1
 the restaurants of the hotel are very good one more expensive and the other with reasonable prices and quality the location is also good especially to catch the tube ,1
 perfect location as we booked for london eye and was only a 5 min walk,1
 position,1
 friendly efficient staff immaculate facilities with top quality linens etc the position of the hotel in relation to public transport ,1
 the location was amazing friendly helpful staff ,1
 bar staff took forever to serve me and then was threatened with being thrown out when i complained customer service non existent manager apologized and gave me a bowl of fruit but by then the damage was done cleaning staff threw away medicine from my room safe did not work in my room paid nearly 500 pound for a room on new years eve and breakfast not included ,0
 the hotel staff were very friendly and competent the hotel is very close to both bus and metro stations we were there for bastille day celebrations and found it very easy to get to and from the eiffel tour for the superb fireworks display bercy village has a fine selection of restaurants and small shops bercy 2 is a good shopping mall only 1 stop away from the hotel by bus ,1
 the room was in the basement with no window and a surface under 4sq meters there was a permanent noise coming from the air conditioning that never stopped the staff was barely speaking english and incapable of solving the issue,0
 we booked and executive double bedroom and received a shoe box the room was tiny you had to walk like a crab between the bed and wardrobe to get to the other side of the room the carpet was coming up in places and it was horrifically stained there was a massive brown stain in one corner looked like it might have been false tan or something i have stayed in travelodges far nicer and cleaner than this place the hotel itself was grotty appreciate it is an old hotel but if you re boasting 4 stars and charging that amount per room you would expect it to be a bit up to date or at least clean i booked this for myself my parter and another room for my parents for a night out in london to say we were all highly disappointed is an understatement i complained at the desk about the state of the room and was just stared at blankly i was then told that if i come back at 8am the following morning they might be able to offer me complimentary breakfast poor customer service as if i m going to set my alarm to get up and go seeking a free breakfast something should have been offered on the spot as is common practice in customer service really really disappointing altogether ,0
 being greeted by a happy member of staff before even entering the hotel helpful and friendly reception staff the cleanliness of the room and the amazing choice at breakfast ,1
 great management nice location,1
 friendly welcoming helpfull,1
 i didn t want maid service but the maid put a bag of fresh towels on the door regardless which was nice ,1
 location and breakfast were very good overall should be 8 5,1
 the perfect british classical interiors,1
 noise there s an underground train nearby make noises not close to underground station,0
 we got given a keycard on arrival where there were still people and belongings in the room we could never get in a lift as they were alwats full and took about ten minutes to reach your floor but there are no stair facilities so had no choice but to wait there was also glass all down our corridor which was just left there all day and when all of our complaints were told to the manager there seemed to be no intetest and offered us a poor 20 refund which i thought was an insult,0
 broken bed leg told it would be ok till next day despite being very unstable we had to insist we were given a different room the next room was on the front of the hotel and was very small lots of road noise hotel certainly not worth 135 per night would not recommend it and we will not be staying here again,0
 the bed was like a cloud smallest lift in the world makes for a funny experience ,1
 the staff were all very friendly and helpful the room was very comfortable and the view was very good ,1
 location excellent no noise between rooms free wifi gym ,1
 only a few minutes walk to london eye and southbank restaurants lovely room with lounge area and microwave facility very clean and everything we needed,1
 bed and room were comfortable if a little cramped getting to the wardrobe was difficult with the table and chair in the way linen good quality but again the bathroom was neat beds although twins had to be touching to leave room at either side glad windows opened but they could have done with cleaning or repainting thermos flasks of tea at b f was brilliant idea location of hotel made up for any negatives ,1
 the staff are friendly and the location on the south bank is great ,1
 in the room was quite cold beacuse the windows couldn t close properly and they were leting in air cold air the breakfast on weekends starts at 8am and not 7 like during the week since we are tourists we like to start early and not lie in we can do that at home but in london is that a waste of time so this hour waiting was a shame ,0
 everything the room was clean and big and had a great view the bathroom was perfect the location was great as the bus station was nearby i recommend this hotel ,1
 every thing,0
 the location is amazing room view so great lovely staff,1
 after a 40minute argument with the on duty desk manager at 12am whilst our children slept in reception we went to bed in a dirty room the room was not made up on either of the 2 days we stayed bar lounge area is poor and staff were rude the look of the hotel and cost does not match the staff working there or the clientele it attracts lots of drunk and disordly behavior ,0
 the room was tiny the bed was quite possibly the most uncomfortable i have ever stayed in ,0
 the manager who is very competent to solve problems,1
 wonderful nights sleep due to super quiet dark comfortable bedroom ,1

 staff could not do enough for you,1
 the hotel was great the rooms were gorgeous and the staff really friendly our room was beautifully decorated very modern sleek design with a mezzanine and spotlessly clean drinks in the bar were good and not overly expensive the hotel was perfectly located in a lovely part of town within easy reach of town using ansterdams great public transport or the hotels rental bikes ,1
 the electricity was suspect with an extension in the room for all appliances the shower was weak the lights so dim you could not read we are told a re wire is imminent,0

 reasonable price for central london good staff service ,1
 excellent location for the london eye royal festival hall and south bank staff were very helpful as we had a slight incident with our first room and rectified the situation effectively upgraded us our junior suite had a lovely view over county hall and the london eye and was very clean ,1
 the servces in gensral,1
 not clean no security needs a lot of maintenance,0
 i liked the usb wall charging ports i enjoyed the tassimo coffee machine in the room breakfast was amazing ,1
 from the moment we arrive to the minute we left the service me and my girlfriend received was amazing we visited the 02 for the ellie goulding concert a few weeks ago literally a stones throw away from the arena which was nice as we were pretty tired from all the drinking and dancing at the concert beds comfy couldn t fault the hotel will visit again ,1
 the fact that other people in my group got a double room with breakfast for 169 i paid 169 for a crappy single room and breakfast was not included ,0
 well trained knowledgeable approachable and friendly staff ,1
 i have booked a king size room but they gave me only small double size room the receptionist was very rude and unhelpful at all the room was very small and the bathroom too,0
 the room was too small the walls were marked to the point it s the first thing you notice about the room unfortunately the room was a 2 3 at the very very most i left after a few hours ,0
 breakfast was excellent,1
 i was accommodated with an early check in and provided a room on a higher floor as requested ,1
 the location so central but hidden away so nice quiet we had actively corner room with a very comfy bed ,1
 the room was amazing ,1
 the staff at the restaurant was completely impolite didn t give us a table even though the restaurant was empty we went to the hotel next door and we had a great dinner even though they were quite full but they were polite and offered a table the bathtub was not working properly and they didn t do anything about it the windows were not opening for the money the room costed it was totally not worth it ,0
 we stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central london central line tube and bus stop only a 4 5 min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions considering the location it is pretty quiet at night this time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost we have stayed in lots of places in london but will definitely stay here again ,1
 room 915 had noisy air conditioning unit buzzing intermittent noisy radiator humming and knocking from air lock a maintenance guy came to fix problem but failed and problem re occurred in middle of night shower hose spilt so diabolical shower staff not interested in hearing whether we had a good stay if you re expecting luxury in the rooms you ll be disappointed very basic hotel chain like decor ,0
 had a basement room absolutely stank in the corridors lift is tiny only 2 people can fit no wifi in bedroom stain on lamp shower was awful bed was really uncomfortable really loud as the walls are so thin ended up being woken up really early and couldn t sleep due to noise a standard double bed in 130cm small double not a normal double no space in bedroom,0
 dirty not clean,0
 food service worst room,0
 location was very good the tube sation was just round the corner,1
 poor shower and very busy overpriced,0

 great location ,1
 friendly and helpful staff delicious breakfast and a good sized clean room ,1
 terrible staff had no idea of basics in hospitality every member of staff gives you a different answers for the same question leaking in the bathroom extremely small rooms especially for 2 people not worth what is charged at all ,0
 breakfast just ok,0
 the room was very small with no window felt like a prison the wifi in my room did not work on iphone or ipad despite several attempts tried to order room service and was told there was no food left and to use just eat not the kind of service you expect from a 4 star hotel paid over 150 for a 1 night stay on a weekday and this was not enough for breakfast to be included ,0
 the location for my business purposes was fine the hotel is ok for london pricing,1
 bed very comfy lovely room with great views,1
 every thing was nice,1
 the hotel and the staff so polite and friendly ,1
 location styling staff were very accommodating ,1
 i requested since i booked for adjacent rooms w inter connecting door but it was not considered i called at least 3 times prior to our arrival but no consideration was given we were offered interconnecting downgraded rooms from executive to superior after a long discussion w front office w c we did not accept your hotel shld give importance to your customers concern not ignored ,0
 rooms are small and unclean bed sheet were dirty and covered in hair room full of dust and needs a deep clean arrived in the evening to check in to be told that we had to pay 50 deposit when i questioned this the receptionist was very rude to us felt more like a inconvenience then a guest don t bother paying for breakfast it s bread no toaster cereal and fruit not worth the money hotel is way over priced and i m very surprised it s a best western very poor hotel in general,0
 cooked part of breakfast not very nice at all although myself and my friend had paid for breakfast hers was not updated according to the hotel therefore an embarrassing wait for her this was hotels fault for not updating their records for which hotel didn t seem bothered ,0
 we paid our room balance and the change they gave us was apparently old notes that aren t used anywhere else not happy ,0
 a noisy location due to road and rail noise there is a huge construction site directly next door which has recently begun this will be under construction for the next couple of years the rooms are dated and in need of full renovation the gym was filthy with dirty walls it was damp and the changing rooms were dire the shower cubicle doors were off their hinges this place needs condemning never again and a case of another hotel ripping guests off by charging for wi fi in 2017 for goodness sake ,0
 location and ambiance excellent service ,1
 room 502 worn down and high roomrate for the standard booked another hotel at arriving day but had to pay two nights even if personnel at booking com informed that only one night should be billed not satisfied ,0
 central to attractions,1
 location staff friendly comfortable rooms nice decoration,1
 room too small wifi has no signal at all short breakfast no parking for the car rooms in a separated building has to cross a n ugly open air area to get the room ,0
 staff super helpful and allowed my niece to practice her french where most parisians automatically speak english it was the purpose of the trip rooms are small but this is standard and are well equipped rooms have ac but it appeared to be centrally controlled at night which was a bit annoying ,1
 the quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise the location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants i cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone ,1
 it was dirty run down over priced poor location some of the staff were friendly and some of them acted like they didn t even want to be there i wouldn t stay again it was offered to me for free ,0
 great staff and location,1
 staff and facilities never come back again,0

 the staff were particularly friendly and helpful it was our 25th wedding anniversary which came out in conversation when we checked in we were surprised and delighted to find a card a bottle of champagne and 2 delicious cakes beautifully presented in our room on the day this was a very thoughtful and kind gesture which would encourage us to pay a return visit ,1
 room very small very overpriced had to get shower gel shampoo from reception desk each day,0
 very charming staff wonderful location clean and proper very good breakfast ,1
 overall had a great experience room was lovely and we had a great view the staff were helpful and my husband had a few surprises in the room for his birthday made our london trip extra special thanks x,1
 staff and facilities spot on nothing to fault at all looking forward for return visit,1
 staff assistance they gave me very bad room while they could offer me some thing better providing that hotel was not full and i did ask for it,0
 the hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside during working hours the noise can be very disturbing the facilities look and sound rickety the a c is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold what s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls chinese water torture anyone the bathroom walls are transparent and i don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint i mean oh my word i didn t want to see that there is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom the staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels the hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it if you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead or another hotel ,0
 very interesting decor good location great little restaurant around the corner ,1
 friendly staff handy for westminster and waterloo ,1
 fabulous location being so close to queensgate excellent service hotel has character with cosy lounges bar great value ,1

 when my wife and i arrived the receptionist said the hotel was under renovation so no air conditioning no phone and worst of all no lift we had to walk 5 flights of stairs to our room everyday it would be nice if we could be told the hotel is under renovation before we arrive but we were not informed on the day we left they promised that they will find a porter to help carry our luggage down the stairs but they ended up failing to get a porter to come in in addition we told two of the staff that we needed them to call a taxi for us to go to the train station on the day we checked out but they ended up finding us a hotel transport when the driver was told to take us to airport luckily the hotel transport person was nice and took us to the train station where we were meant to go to otherwise we would end up being at airport ,0

 room not much bigger than a shoe box and certainly not 4 star or value for money,0

 beds were so comfortable,1
 lovely room taseful decor and artwork around the hotel friendly and helpful staff ,1
 location and features of the hotel,1
 unprofessional stuff rooms layout are very stupid bed beside the door toilet in front of the bed the rest of the room like the kitchen and sofa are inside far away from the door i mean everything is reversed,0
 dryness in dealing and inflexibility and providing hospitality in the fullest they were interested in obtaining the money without providing the required service,0
 front staff cheated me on my refund they told me to expect my 100 deposit in my account in five days it has not been refunded since one month,0
 air conditioned so noisy bed next to bathroom no internet no bottle of water in room ,0

 the staff in every area of the hotel were amazing ,1
 nothing to dislike,0
 fantastic customer service and beautiful rooms,1
 very small rooms we had a superior room so i cannot imagine how small are the normal rooms also we found it very expensive for location quality of the rooms not so close from kings cross about 20 min walk tv not working staff did not repair it over 2 days but they offered us a discount on the room fair enough ,0
 had to wait for over an hour to check in had to leave our luggage with the porter as we had dinner pre booked and checked in later in the evening worst customer service ever experience never even said sorry that we had been through this experience also if you have already checked in online they dont ever go the the quick check in desk so everyone has to queue up in the same queue ,0

 staff very professional and helpful ,1
 very friendly and helpful staff 2 minutes from underground ,1
 it was quiet and comfortable with a lovely bright room three windows and large bathroom,1
 brilliant stay especially the staff at breakfast ,1
 wifi is broken room is noisy the manager is rude when i complained the broken wifi the manager theaten me to call the police if i continue to complain i haven t seen a people rude like that especially in a hotel ,0
 a bit stubborn ,0
 though i booked for three night mainly to be able to check in immediately upon my arrival i wasnt cheched in but had to put in two rooms in temporary basis befor finaly moved to my final place this is totally unacceptable and not satsifactory i demand compensation from you or the hotel for the inconvenience and hassle i had to go through ,0
 the room was overheated and we did not get any sleep at all even after we reported it to reception nothing was done i emailed twice once i was home to ask for an explanation and received no reply or acknowledgement from k kiren who is supposed to be the hotel manager the level of customer service is a joke once they have your money they don t want to hear of any issues ,0
 bad bed small room small bathroom could not arrange a taxi to airport have my card detail online at check in because leaving early still had to give them my card when checking out and cheapest of all they re charg for internet access ,0

 room size and house keeping,0
 excellent staff including the chef at breakfast who was able to accommodate for a food intolerance fantastic room very clean comfortable beds ,1
 all the amenities in the room the fridge coffee machine microwave dishes etc was like home from home,1
 the rooms were pathetic the corridor smelled the bathroom smelled ,0
 the hotel interior is impressive and attractive the breakfast was also very good ,1
 due to late arrival beyond our control even though we had emailed and followed up to ensure a twin room this was not available despite staff saying it would be set side for us the staff upon arrival made us feel second class mentioned we booked via booking com and argued therefor we should not expect anything extra not a classy treatment from a otherwise high end hotel chain ,0
 great to watch the tall ships great to get away from busy london plenty of places to eat near by and convenient for the tube or bus even easy to walk to greenwich easy to get to 02 for a concert friendly staff,1
 the staff i was greeted by was hardly helpful in fact rather rude the wifi is supposed to be free and hassle free but you have to fill in a application form for fullers just to get on and then are bombarded by their advertising over and over again ,0
 staff room close to tube station,1
 the whole hotel had the feel of somewhere that had been given a cheap makeover to make it look more expensive that it was there was poor attention to detail e g on arrival in room we found the fabric on the desk chair to be ripped evidence of poor quality repairs in bathroom the classic double was the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in made worse by the tiny windows situated high up the wall the hotel is a labyrinth and guests are provided with a poorly designed map to navigate ,0
 room was needing a complete over haul and update room was very noisy due to heating or lift over priced for what it was bar needs complete refurbishment and does not entice people to eat in it ,0
 great location with close proximity to a number of tube stations,1
 unfriendly and unhelpful staff,0
 staff were friendly and efficient breakfast was awesome and the tasting menu pretty good thanks for a fab stay ,1

 good location stayed here before some years ago great facility when only topping one night that you can leave bags and pick up later,1
 room smelt of musk room was tatty and grubby drain smelt bad room was so small you had to step over the corner of the bed to get to the other side of the room ,0
 first impressions were excellent the staff were very welcoming our room was very comfortable there was even a tunnel to get to the o2 arena without having to walk around ,1
 room we had had a fantastic view location of hotel excellent,1
 everything else booking com promised a 4 star hotel for a huge discount on what we had assumed was the standard rate the hotel is old tired the staff are poor and the facilities and rooms the beds especially would deserve no more than 2 stars ,0
 awful old and got charged twice staff unhelpful and didn t know what they were doing dirty room and very small ,0
 location and access to the o2 fantastic room restaurant and bar views great good tube connection only 5 10 mins walk breakfast was excellent great buffet choice ,1
 room was comfortable though couldn t swing a cat but had everything you could need staff were friendly and helpful good breakfast in a comfortable dining room ,1
 rooms were spacious and reception staff were very helpful ,1
 the location for the o2 is perfect and the hotel is very bright modern and clean ,1
 the room was so small the bed was at best a large single bed would not call it a double bed not much room for a couple bathroom was tiny no room in the shower and certainly not enough room to dry yourself the room was also small not much room for 2 people to move around there was a loud annoying noise coming from outside the room which might have been some air conditioning units but when we called to complain about this the noise stopped but then started again 10 minutes later and continued on and off throughout the night not sure why there was a window in the room when all there was to look at was the peoples room opposite and some brick walls ,0
 accommodation superb,1
 the staff accused us of smoking in the room and locked our key cards told to check cctv and see us smoking outside every night before bed why bother if we were smoking in the room persecuted and made to feel unwelcome ,0
 staff not very friendly had to ask for dinner dishes to be removed about 20mins after the meal was finished ,0
 location,0
 there was special attention regards to the celebration of my husbands 35th birthday with a bottle of champagne and amazing chocolate cake in our room ,1
 the shower was leaked and i ask them to look 3 times and always tell me they send the technician to fix but every when i get back the shower was the same ,0
 some of the rooms were extremly small furniture is over used staff not very helpful very crowded and house keeping is not good,0
 the room was really small a very dated doesn t matchwith the price who they charge,0
 the rooms was newly refurbished and very clean it was absolutely fine for our over night stay ,1
 this property does not reflect hilton image at all i stayed in 611 and found the room to be pretty stange interms of convenience access and in general service was bad and the whole experience wasn t pleasant my colleague who stayed in 303 was earlier directed to a room where there was someone already staying and that too in the middle of the night a serious lapse on part of the hotel reservation team i would say there is a lot to improve upon ,0
 only the price reminds of a 4 stars hotel nothing else tiny room just a bit larger than the bed dirty glasses and cups with lipstick marks we had to take them back to reception to have them replaced the reaction of the staff was a bit annoyed like why would we bother for such a small issue dirty carpet very dusty very poor lighting certainly to save the planet or the power bill staff generally ok some very nice and proactive some a bit arrogant and totally unhelpful worn out towels almost see through with ripped edges shower over the bath tub spraying the whole bathroom no ventilation in the bathroom scarce supplies we ve stayed two days there was no shampoo we had only a bit of shower gel on the bottom of a container dispenser also marked as shampoo but unusable because of burning the eyes very badly only one milk portion for two guests a tissue box with only one tissue in it we had to go back to reception to ask for a new box nothing like you would expect from a 4 star hotel e g bath coats slippers etc the remote control was very dirty and sticky lucky that we did not need to use it because the tv did not work anyway due to poor antenna or bad link to the antenna we complained they did nothing they only offered a drink at the bar as compensation when we checked out no thanks and no we will not return i m not sure how they got that high average score maybe was just our experience well below average ,0
 the room,0

 we loved our stay here we only stayed one night of three in london and i wish we had spent every night here the staff was very friendly and helpful we were able to check in early which was really great after a horrible night at a hostel the night before the hotel also had complimentary umbrellas to use which is very useful for rainy weather in london when we come back to london we will stay here and most definitely recommend it to others ,1
 excellent place with newly refurbished room,1
 everything about the hotel it s dated and being run down the facilities were all out of use or broken and no ladies changing room in pool due to a flood i won t be returning,0

 perfect location excellent facilitie helpful staff,1
 the kettle didn t work the hairdryer didn t work the shower head needed replacing the room had totally inadequate and ancient electrical power facilities only one electrical socket for shared use for hairdryer kettle any personal electronic devices we had 4 in need of charging and that was 4 6 metres away from the beds meaning it could only be used with an extension lead it took 4 times and three hours before a lead was provided and then when used it fused the system because the power to the room was insufficient for the load only one shared bedside table light and only one floor lamp for lighting for the whole dark room a totally sub standard quality standard room the room should be very urgently brought into the 20th century let alone the 21st ,0
 being quoted ex vat being asked to pay a deposit on arrival breakfast being charged as extra and the offer being quoted ex of vat the standard of breakfast the attitude of staff the noisy air con unit the fact that the door key didn t work on each of the two nights i stayed as it had been exposed to a credit card or mobile phone in fact it was a crap stay,0
 breakfast service finished at 9 am were not made aware of this most hotels 10am carpets dirty need replacing could do with a makeover,0
 highly responsive staff new wide clean and comfortable rooms coffee tea water is complimentary in the room the big table in the room and microvawe is a plus,1
 wrong hotel very hot even with the heating off no way of cooling it down hairdryer wasn t working not enough power sockets very cramped,0
 upgraded to premium suites on arrival after being advised we were guests of the day free drinks at the bar free breakfast and bigger room also great location for city centre ,1
 small room but clean new professional staff good bed and thea coffee biscuits in the room very good dor a night over in london ,1
 centrally located,1
 the politeness and friendliness of staff the location in comparison to our plans the cleanliness of the hotel and our room lovely and quiet professional staff ,1
 the room was tiny bathroom was filthy bittdn by insect windows dirty no fridge,0
 we were placed in a smoking room on arrival despite our booking specifically stating that we had booked a non smoking room this room was disgusting dingy and it reeked of stale smoke staff told us the hotel was fully booked and so we were unable to be moved that night we were also woken up by drilling at 8am ,0
 affordable friendly staff,1
 the room was only just slightly bigger than the double bed so no room to move at all worst of all though the plug socket was broken and i got electrocuted while i was trying to plug in phone charger when i complained to reception they said absolutely nothing and the manager wasn t around to speak to i have been waiting almost a week now for them to call me as every time i call them the manager is not available they are lucky it wasn t a child or someone with existing health problems who touch plug socket or this could have been a lot more serious ,0
 recently refurbished room clean comfortable bed ,1
 room heater so bad,0
 we were upgraded to a suite but it had no heating in the bedroom or bathroom it was cold the bathroom also had smelly drains not pleasant the sitting room area was under furnished and the suite overall needed a refurbishment with scuffs on the furniture and badly hung net curtains we did point this out in at check out but no interest from receptionist we have stayed at this hotel a few times and it has declined each visit we won t be back ,0
 we were supposed to have a double bed however they joint 2 single beds together which made it rather uncomfortable,0
 room was so small and smelled as an ashtray staff was not really helpful the hotel need a serious renovation as it s outdated and shabby the bed size was also smaller than in any hotels i stayed before the breakfast starts at 7am which is too late already but they start it at 7 30am on saturdays so i had to go to the airport without having breakfast and yes they do have a huge construction site right in front of the window and you can hear all the sounds of constructing from 6am avoid this hotel ,0
 hotel rude staff and dirty room ,0
 the hotel is fantastic ,1
 room was lovely,1
 great location nice area and near the tube station for piccadilly line beautiful and ornate building which stands out from the other hotels nearby we were celebrating my wife s birthday and the staff provided a great room wine and chocolates to welcome her good breakfast nice lounge bar no real facilities to mention such as gym or sauna but ideal for a weekend in london would definitely use again ,1
 breakfast had a good range and was fresh,1
 the ambiance,1
 breakfast was excellent lots of choice great location easy walk to two underground locations quiet neighborhood amazing value for money in london ,1
 the staff was helpful and friendly the lobby bar and breakfast areas are pleasant it is conveniently located close to the center without being in a noisy road very close proximity to fast food chains supermarket and the metro ,1
 convenient for hammersmith,1
 the bathroom sink was blocked and the room requires a complete upgrade not what i expected for the price i paid,0
 the bed was extra comfy and the staff were very kind the place was clean and there were a lot of boulangeries around ,1
 perfect location for us,1
 all staff is very attentive and helpful you feel you are in paris palace,1
 run down facilities basic utilities not in working condition air condition was not functioning shower water lacks pressure staff not trained and can t offer any solution overall a terrible experience,0
 the whole stay abliet 1 night my 50th was excellent and the breakfast was awesome thank you and we very much look forward to another visit lesley dean,1
 housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue ,0
 the bed was so unbelievably comfortable and there was so much choice for breakfast the hotel also did a lovely job on a surprise for my partner s birthday ,1
 great location clean and very nice staff,1
 nothing really funtioning in the room like doors locker tv etc extremely bad quality of bed the hotel rooms are very old the corridors very narrow ,0
 breakfast is just average first day house keeping is really bad they even did not put any shower gel and shampoo in the shower room facilities also look out of date ,0
 lovely large room with the bonus of a kitchenette shower was powerful and the toiletries were great quality ,1
 no parking a 20 mins walk to carpark which costs and extra 42 a day staff very unhelpful the rooms were tiny and the breakfast was rubbish,0
 my room was so small that the head and foot and side of the bed were up against the wall and at 5 feet 7 inches my feet hit the wall on the other end of the bed the bathroom was so small and cramped that you had to tight squeeze yourself between the wall and sink to get to the toilet and when you were on the toilet the sink was in your chest you couldn t stand in front of the toilet at all and it was very uncomfortable and inconvenient for the high rate it was poor value the breakfast was good but the wait staff frequently messes up orders or ignored people or forgot what they were going to get people ,0
 staff were superb and hotel was well located,1
 good location staff are very friendly and helpful very clean,1
 agressive and rude staff members at the front desk one central ac machine powers the whole building means an individual ac unit in the room is extremely weak when everyone in the building turns on their room ac our room s ac was not cool at all room was tiny does not match other 4 star hotels in london ,0
 better vegetarian options would be good staff were terrific ,1
 breakfast was really nice staff great ,1
 the carpets were stained and the room had paint peeling the room advertised at booking was bigger and had a desk and chair which was not the case in reality the view was the dirty back end of two other buildings the bathroom light was faulty and the replacement didn t work properly either there were no tv channels in english the complimentary water wasn t replaced on day 2 of three and the bath mat was missed on the initial 2 days the hotel didn t have any added facilities like a pool or sauna ,0
 if we requested anything extra it was attended to immediately had a small fridge in room which was empty for our use,1
 breakfast was excellent and the staff were so efficient,1
 the staff friendliness,1
 the bed was extra comfy,1
 just a really good hotel breakfast was very good rooms lovely ,1
 better staff communication a little more compassion shown in the circumstances took money despite non attendance very poor ,0
 wifi never worked while there staff unsure of the surroundings or how to call a taxi when we the could not use wifi to call uber location far from central took 45 min in cab to get anywhere staff rude and unhelpful with booking error could have stayed much more conveniently in central london for less ,0
 dirty old every facilities such as gym pool parking will be extra charge ,0
 my room it was very small and cold,0
 lovely staff and great location very comfortable bed and breakfast was delicious would stay again when next in london,1
 very small room like a rat hole ,0
 great breakfast and very nice staff location perfect great wifi,1
 the hotel is clean and fresh and of a good standard the breakfast left a lot to be desired and was really expensive ,1
 the breakfast was exceptionally poor looked like a shortage of staff lead to a lack of everything had to wait so long for the rest of breakfast to arrive that what we had already selected was cold none of the staff were friendly seemed impatient with being asked where things were the eating area looked very tired had been down graded to a cafe with wooden stirrers instead of spoons left feeling as though we should have eaten out the pillows on the bed smelt of cigarette smoke which we would have changed had it not been so late when we realised last time we stayed we really enjoyed it that s why we booked again ,0
 the staff we didn t get any help that we asked very inflexible ,0
 entrance is very bad we have to walk through the bar,0
 have stayed here before very comfortable good showers good breakfast ,1
 the hotel rooms are very tired and not very clean there was a smell in the room like old fish wasn t pleasant at all room was small and the en suite you couldn t swing a cat in it all for 192 per night ,0
 there was no water in the toilet or for washing your face and i was told there was a problem with the water and they can not do anything about it and not even an apology i checked in about 2 15am and a rude waiter reluctantly showed where do i get a sandwich from and when i went there i saw a mice is paying around in the dining area dare i say more ,0
 the rooms are much smaller than it shown in the images staff recommend me for 680 for upgrade to club lounge and it was most awful food and the room not much better than standard room then the shower curtain was full of dirt that i couldn t believe complaint to the shift manager about the dust in the room and dirt in the shower the internet wasn t connecting to the server at all he came and took pictures and promised to sort it out i ve stayed there for 17 days and nothing happened over all from 1 10 i ll give 2 to this hotel and won t go back there ever again ,0
 the room the staff,1
 room was beautiful great views of the o2 service exemplary and breakfast fabulous ,1
 heating only blew out cold air noisy heating and or plumbing breakfast was poor room was small staff couldn t resolve our problems ,0
 the standard of room the view of the generators from my second floor window the minimal amounts of tea and coffee in the room the lack of english speaking staff rudeness of staff and totally being ignored at breakfast then having to seat ourselves and lay our own tables,0
 small room in the basement i ve stayed in other hotels nearby for a similar price that are far superior,0
 major refurb going on building site basically,0
 close to tube station and clean room,1
 warmth of staff location size of room,1
 design of the room ,1
 location isn t great for central london around a 40 minute walk from charing cross took an age to check in even though there was no queue couldn t watch the tv as the digital reception was so poor and the lights were flickering as though there wasn t a continuous electricity supply the automatic door sensors at the entrance didn t seem to work and whacked me in the shoulder as i walked through then they charged over double for the room and it took two weeks to get my money back after being passed round numerous people saying they couldn t find it being asked to send bank account statements through numerous times eventually it was blamed on a system error and no apology or offer of any form of compensation was provided yeah i wonder just how often this happens never again ,0
 our check in was delayed 3times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many london hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general the friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of 4 bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill this experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over 300 per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels ,0
 the meeting rooms overpriced and unacceptable no facilities what so ever ,0
 paid more for a club room and got given a very small room which clearly wasn t a club room,0
 we were really located at short notice really poor communication of this change this cut into our stay time we were also promised a call back from the manager to no avail i shall be warning friends and family to avoid,0
 great location and the staff at breakfast time where fantastic,1
 friendly helpful staff great room with stunning views across london and the thames fab breakfast didn t need to eat again all day ,1
 the air condition is not working poor in every thing,0
 lovely friendly staff,1
 room was very clean bed a little firm but lovely pillows good location for events at apollo ,1
 the staff were excellent professional and friendly we received an unexpected free upgrade and champagne and cake for our celebration just wonderful ,1
 aircon so loud you can t have it on bedding so old and grubby it is offensive i cold shower in the morning attrocious i stay in london often twice a week min and i m used to rough but i even texted home at how bad this place was maybe it s just room 2 don t stay there ,0
 the lower staff is very sweet and courteous but the senior staff is rather odd they say things without thinking and act as if doing a favour for the most basic services a hotel big or small would provide cute rooms but exorbitantly priced for what they are even considering then the location we paid 130 gbp a night but would ve liked to pay half of that at best ,0
 room and bed size was extremely small not same as what we saw in the photographs at the time of booking no complimentary water which i think is standard in all hotels ,0
 the room,0
 no refrigerator in the room you can ask the staff to put your food in the kitchen refrigerator very small room i think the bedsheets were not changed everyday,0
 how close i was to a tube station,1
 very hospitable staff are very helpful ,1
 some of the staff were absolutely so rude our tv didn t work so they just messed us around with rooms and blah blah saying they gave us this and that room at the end they gave us smaller rooms then tried to charge us more1 kept taking different amounts of money from my account which still hasn t returned just disgusting service so confusing and time consuming not worth it especially when on holiday just a 2 star hotel with a good name living off the mayfair name nowhere near its standards oh the hotel room was very dusty and caused breathing problems here and there not the fault of the cleaning staff but the senior management who should be on top of these things if you want to be in mayfair as a new visitor in london spend a little more money and get something better yes its cheaper than some but its cheap for a reason spend wisely ,0
 cold water overnight in the shower poor breakfast ,0
 hotel room was very clean and fresh also the gym and swimming pool was very impressive location very near kings cross a 10 brisk minute walk ,1
 pastries fruit were very good and fresh with good selection,1
 location,1
 everything,0
 very very noisy hotel you can not sleep in the morning because of the noises you can hear the underground from the early morning hours very old hotel very dull and old rooms no hot water some times i cal tell it is only a 3 stars hotel,0
 the cleaning staff have an appauling attitude towards my female partner they were very rude and somewhat offensive often sigh and screw there face up at you,0
 the room was a good size and a comfy bed with an excellent view over london and the wembley arch in the distance from my 8th floor window ,1
 great attention to guests given a lovely birthday surprise of cake and a card in my room ,1
 the character of the building and ornate marble to the foyer room clean comfortable great location for euston station will be back ,1
 i like very much location spacious room staff behavior etc ,1
 nice hotel very clean and staff friendly plenty of choice for breakfast attractions are within walking distance and if you did need to get a taxi the park plaza opposite has a taxi rank with plenty of taxis waiting our hotel room had a kitchenette with microwave which was great as we have a toddler so was easy to warm her food and milk for the evening overall our stay was very pleasant and we would recommend ,1
 nobody told us before check in that the hotel was under renovation and that there was too much noise all day was given a room on 28th floor right below where rwnovatikn was happening the concierge desk guys were royally ignoring me seemed to be the case due to my color it seems because the same guys were super attentive to caucasians really guys being a luxury hotel nobody came to pick up my luggage from reception to room and vice versa no opening of doors for you nobody asked me for a cab when i was checking out while they were doing the same for other guests worst services ever amongst all the hotels i have stayed in trust me i have stayed in a lot there were other smaller things no toiletries when i checked in two single bed blankets kept on a double bed room service guys opening the door and coming in without knocking or ringing the bell ,0
 upgraded to appartment had to check out after first night which messed up our plans as was told couldn t stay in same room for full 2 days also no bedding provided for sofa bed for second person so cold and uncomfortable sleep on return to the hotel at midnight put back in same room appartment had no been cleaned no coffee replenished staff very unhelpful not the service i expected for 315 for 2 nights,0
 no parking place poor breakfast old furniture door broken it doesn t have the facilities of a 4 stars hotel ,0
 super space and comfort,1
 great location for o2 excellent facilities ,1
 location ,1
 every thing is horrible,0
 not informed of a massive building project next door at time of booking very noisy restaurant bar closed on our last night due to refurbishment without any notice to the guests no cooked breakfast on the last day due to the closure the only option was a continental breakfast grab bag delivered to the room ,0
 comfy bed well appointed spacious room with good attention to detail ,1
 the staff new little about the area on arrival and made little effort to find out if you go to this hotel make sure they do not put you in a room next to the main road it s next to a hospital and i was kept awake by ambulances all night the room was mediocre and in my opinion not at all worth the money paid i m aware that this is london and you pay for the location but for a radisson i m very disappointed ,0
 the the hotel is so uniqe i like how it looks like from the old movie in term decoration style yet it keeps it modern culture,1
 good location staff helpful ,1
 staff was very good and helpful breakfast was very good,1
 location and service was excellent ,1
 as a couple travelling with a 4 month old baby this hotel wasn t suitable at all no way to sterilese bottles which didn t need to be in the kitchens hotel as stated for safety reasons any microwave even from a staff room would do the job after checked out we went back for our case and baby needed to change her nappie and there was no baby changing was told to change her nappie on the floor of the restroom which was very dirty by the way after complaining was offered a room to change her at the end would like to know what child services are provide for this hotel once they say that on their hotel facilities ,0
 hotel is very tired and the air conditioning is useless very old noisy ineffective not good for london in the summer,0
 location and staff helpfulness ,1
 every nite problem to sleep as the room are not sound proof hotel is full with middle east guest with kids who is playing and running around the aisle and u could hear from the room for 4 nights i could only sleeps around 2 3 only after the kids stop playing every nite problem to sleep as the room are not sound proof hotel is full with middle east guest with kids who is playing and running around the aisle and u could hear from the room for 4 nights i could only sleeps around 2 3 only after the kids stop playing ,0
 very nice,1
 bed was very uncomfortable needed new mattress 40 minute wait for breakfast as staff didn t have a clue how to be organised over half the tables covered in plates very poor ,0
 we booked what was called a superior double room we had a tiny double bedded room in basement really only suitable for single occupancy the space between the end of the bed and the wall was a matter of inches and you had to bend over the bed to avoid hitting the tv also we elected to include breakfast at a cost of 18 each assuming it was a good cooked breakfast at that price in fact it was only a rather poor continental breakfast cooked breakfast was 24 each at booking you did not specify type of breakfast definitely thought this a rip off ,0
 the beds and pillows were comfy the staff were helpful and friendly room was clean,1
 location,1
 most things terrible location was meh ,0
 the set up in our room and bathroom was clean and a staff member called daniel was amazing who works at reception,1
 the staff were friendly and very helpful the hotel is amazing the room was very comfortable and had all little extras ,1
 pool was lovely and bed was so nice and soft cover,1
 everyone was helpful and made you feel really relaxed the hotel rooms are very well equipped with everything you could asked for ,1
 good hotel modern stylish decor and spacious room very friendly and helpful staff would definitely revisit ,1
 it always annoyes me to arrive at a hotel and find that i have been mis lead this hotels boasts 4 and a half stars it is a 2 star hotel even by paris standards the room was barely 9sq metres the chair could not be pulled out without hitting the bed the bed and pillows had the comfort of an autopsy table everything about this hotel is dark cramped and depressing for nearly au300 a night i had the right to expect much more we got out as soon as possible thanks to booking com and found a beautiful 3 star hotel in the theatre district the contrast was startling if you want to ruin your stay in paris this place is for you otherwise keep looking ,0
 i have never encountered staff who were more rude beds that were less comfortable rooms that were more stuffy or bathrooms more in need of an update this place is a 2 star hotel at best,0
 everything was not the same as shown or said when i booked the hotel trough booking com 1 the air condition was not working we called reseption several times they send enginior comes at 0800 any way we called at 0810 and a guy called enginior came to room and as result they send me one heater to keep us warm while the heating equipment was daikin and is suppose to be of the best type 2 the lightning switch were not working during the night we woke up severl times and we got crazy sleeping with light on 3 the dush in showeroom was nicely built but under the dush the water got kold in first day and after that in day two still there was cold water we could not get shower while staing from 23 12 26 12 we use wet towel in order to clean the body 4 for breakfast they told us that as tower seuit room which must be the best room paid to hotel we get excecutiveplace to eat here was not enough place to sit here the quantity of breakfast was very cheap and little choices this iis while we paid exra for breakfast 5 internet and wifi we called zero and got a code after 2 hours person number two in the room called reseption and lady told me that we have to pay extra i protested and the lady said you have not boked trough us and that is why,0
 1 i rented 2 rooms they charged twice for one room but i got refund later 2 the room was cold i asked to turn heater on then they opened 3 tv was not working it is fixed but then it was out of order again 4 one of the electric plug was not operating 5 rooms are very small,0
 great design of the room which was very cosy loved the atmosphere in the hotel nice products in the bathroom and the location is right in the center of the trendy paris with many bars and restaurants around,1
 the doors the shower gel the fact that the kettle was already plugged in before my arrival,1
 comfort and cleanliness,1
 one of the worst experiences i ever had it s an apartment at few minutes walk from the main hotel the receptionist gave us the wrong key and we had to call several time and finally walk back ourselves twice before they found out the error they didn t even apologise for that they ended up totally ruining our evening there weren t enough towels in the room and they didn t offer to bring any we had to walk back to the reception the following day to get them the wifi wasn t working fortunately now europe is free roaming the last day we had to leave early so we asked the receptionist if we could leave the keys inside she told us yes so we did few days later i was charged for late check out i called them and explained the situation they promised a reimbourse which of course never came ,0
 super comfy bed fabulous views sky bar amazing staff exceptional location perfect for o2,1
 bed was comfortable view from room was great staff were friendly restaurant was excellent and choice of foods for breakfast buffet were good ,1
 clean and comfortable room friendly staff quite ,1
 perfect location clean modern hotel and we was given a complimentary upgrade as it was my boyfriends birthday our room was beautiful and big with lots of lovely little extras that make all the difference staff were very helpful with my request for an early check in thank you can not fault it we d definitely return ,1
 sufficient and served quickly,1
 the receptionist was excellent and changed our room without question as we were looking at pipes on the 3rd floor and the river on the 10th ,1
 lovely hotel amazing staff very quirky property steeped in history only let down the ridiculously small bathrooms,1
 no air conditioning in the rooms tiny rooms ,0
 i spend more than two hours including time on the phone with booking com to have one day extension i fell that they where hunting me to overcharge by delaying answers to very simple request ,0
 room was old and dirty didn t sleep for 2 nights due to the bed being so uncomfortable,0
 beautiful building good location comfortable bed great out door area,1
 the location is very central 2 minutes walk from queensbury tube station yet quiet gorgeous quintessentially english facade and common areas makes you feel going back in time nice staff nothing a problem given free room upgrade to club room which was adequately spacious and had view of hyde park free wifi and tea coffee biscuits in room ,1
 not worth of money at all awful was meant to be a nice treat for my mother 50th no extras given no even a card no bath bottles water tasted old no breakfast included very disappointed road was noisey bed was sqeaking to be honest i felt like it was a waste of money then taking 50 pound in arrival as a holding for extra then on departure saying it wint be in my bank for two working days is awful felt ripped off ,0
 on the whole all the staff were very helpful and professional and friendly especially max on the concierge desk making sure we had a car booked to take us to the ritz for dinner and the very polite helpful doorman,1
 the absolute ignorance of the pool by the staff the appalling and irresponsible behaviour of some guests and their children breaking all the rules what could lead to a trauma and severe hurt is absolutely not controlled by the staff no one never stopped it there is no staff near the pool some people jumping and taking all the small pool for themselves simply do not let other guests of the hotel to swim quietly tired customers have to argue with impolite people instead of relax after a hard business day the presence of staff fulfilling their duties correctly could help resolving this problem the hotel also could control and aloud the parents with kids under 14 be in the pool only before at least 8 p m i am generous there is some hotels with severe restrictions like 2 p m to let the others relax after this time and it will be fair because lots of parents absolutely do not control their children s noisy and dangerous behaviour and even show the bad example themselves another thing my husband was absolutely furious leaving the shower he discovered a mum of 2 teenagers inside mens changing room the manager who saw it it was minutes before closing did tell nothing yes we got that the pool is without surveillance and everything is our personal risk but i do not think the customers are ok with that is the pool a part of the hotel it works like not but it is surely included in the customers bill make it for additional price but control it or do something because the ignorance like this could not lead to anything right this is absolutely shameful for the overpriced hotel do not respect the customers i really think to find another hotel to stay next time and stop being a returning and loyal client ,0
 fantastic location walk down craven terrace and in hyde park and kensington park within 5 minutes get tube from lancaster gate quicker and better than from paddington good hotel nice curry menu ,1
 we were offered a room in the basement 2nd floor from ground reception floor even thogh the rate we paid was considerable for such a hotel then we managed to get room on the fourth floor reception 2 after a long negotiation the key cards and the tv flat screen worked occasionally and at their own discretion we turned off the tv could watch only one channel by deplugging a noise of about 80 db woke us at 6 am every morning which we thougt was caused by pushing of some metal carts alarms went on one night at 2 am for no reason and we didnot know or were not told whether we should evacuate furniture literally was worn out and away drawers were falling off and not being pushed back we had to stay there because of proximity to a certain address but the neighbourhood was very unpleasent ,0
 poor room quality and dated fittings decor room not clean as you would expect for pricey hotel extra deposit not mentioned in booking or conditions very very poor,0
 room no 1 was tiny immediately outside the window is some piece of equipment heating aircon i think that was permanently on sound levels varying from loud to very loud if that wasn t bad enough disturbed sleep man on reception reacted to my comment as if i was the first person ever to complain about it reception area is tired and looks grubby ,0
 great location very friendly staff,1
 they told me i can check in at 2pm but when i arrived the staff hasnt cleaned the room which let me wait for 40mins the room was noise and wifi connection was good ,0
 great location super great breakfast one of the best one in london,1
 amazing rooms with beautiful view of river food was delicious particularly the veal croqettes and the salmon staff are helpful and friendly ,1
 nice hotel frendley staff,1
 everything are bad they put me in small smallest room in the world even though i reserved standard and when i explain to them they told me we will change it in the next day depend on the availability the elevator is not working and others customers told me been it has been like this for more than 3 weeks did you believe four star hotel with no elevator for more than 3 weeks and you have to go walking upstairs every time you came and in my case i was in the 6 floor i think this hotel can get maximum 2 stars with the facilities available it s shame on mercure upper management to have like this hotel in london,0
 the staff were very helpful and friendly responding quickly to the request to move rooms the second room was great clean comfortable and roomy also the corridor smelt fragrant throughout the stay the staff were helpful giving advise where to park and looking after the bags after we checked out breakfast was a feast fresh wide choice and relaxed atmosphere ,1
 room and location was amazing,1
 the room was overpriced the bathroom was cramped the place lacks decor and warmth lifts too slow and crowded overall not a great stay ,0
 everything personnel not qualified old rooms not enough space to put one baggage in a double room no respect of the contract i ordered one double bed and they give me one bed tv broken minibar open ,0
 the location and the grill room had great food ,1
 convenient comfortable quiet,1
 staff service hotel style food beverages,0
 high spec fitments and furnishings very clean helpful staff ,1
 comfy beds excellent staff hotel was very clean will be staying again on my next trip ,1
 not royal not grand the rooms are very small like prison cell not enough space for luggage maintenance very bad ,0
 the location the helpfulness of the staff ,1
 no bath towels in one room only 1 bath towel in the other bathrooms not clean beds not made properly,0
 great hotel would stay again the only odd thing was was seats in the bar area were really old tatty and uncomftable which was really odd as everything else was great ,1
 the interaction,0
 based in the heart of london with everything on your doorstep warm friendly and welcoming staff that make your stay truly pleasurable ,1
 smelly carpets in the hall ways lots of unlit steps in the hall ways a step in our room to get to the bathroom unlit at night and dangerous food expensive and not good quality,0
 staff ware arogon,0
 noise from traffic and other guests was very loud tv didnt work despite asking several times and twice being promised a new remote control would be given to us nothing was done wifi cut out constantly despite paying their premium fee for wifi when i expressed my concern the receptionist was not interested at all and made me feel that i was being unreasonble,0
 cleanliness location and breakfast,1
 the friendly staff in bar restaurant the evening meal was excellent a pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful after the building renovations i think this hotel will be fabulous it has so much history and is so unusual loved it ,1
 the hotel is in walking distance from paddington station and so to heathrow that s my reason for using this hotel ,1
 the noisy generators outside our bedroom and not a pretty view,0
 awful 2 out of 3 of our party had to have their room changed one due to the dirtiness and mould in the bathroom the other due to the leaking air con ,0
 quality of hotel is poor unclean and looking in need of refurbishment,0
 beautiful breakfast room amazing location close to all the shops and gardens and galleries lovely staff the concierge and reception staff were fantastic ,1
 breakfast very ordinary and staff need some customer service training urgently ,0
 hi there the staff was friendly prompt on taking care of me ,1
 everything it s just great to stay at such a place and let yourself being pampered ,1
 very small room to hot,0
 a treat for us great location room and public areas lovely we would definitely stay here again ,1
 the rooms were extremely small and overpriced we asked to be moved from the first room as it was in the basement off the main corridor and what felt like a storage area very disappointed for the price being charged the second room was an improvement however still very small ,0
 excellent location near major railway lines easy to get from the airport friendly and helpful staff a homely atmosphere and personal attention highly recommended ,1
 the staff where so unhelpful telly broken complimentary drinks half drunk staff couldn t have cared less very disappointed and i m not normally one to complain ,0
 high tea was very exquisite and memorable bar and restaurant staff beyond reproach concierge was exceptional and arranged the best theatre tickets in the house on such short notice the upgraded superior rooms facing hyde park definitely worth the price for the added space and views club intercontinental the perfect atmosphere and setting for breakfast and cocktails ,1
 internet did not revealed true location which was awful no proper bar or restaurant expensive for what we got and stuffy cramped rooms bathroom was so small we kept hitting ourselves very poor indeed would not go again or recommend a boutique hotel it is not ,0
 room was small air con did not work poor check in breakfast luke warm damaged hair dryer replaced staff unsure of breakfast payment and aggressively interrupted our food terrible phone service when questioned by customer service ,0
 friendly efficient staff who always have a smile on their faces old school service is always appreciated,1

 very nice all round,1
 stunning period building with art nouveau features,1
 banging noise till 3 am,0
 the staff were so helpful and friendly professional ,1
 waking up in the morning to look at o2 arena from hotel room,1
 hotel was relying on its location undeniably good but the room and bathroom sizes will eventually be it s undoing people expect more these days and are prepared to pay more,1
 room is excellent all things in room are brand nw hotel is near to city and royal court very good for business trip ,1
 cost of car parking,0
 on opening the door to our room we were greeted with an overpowering smell of damp mouldy stench we opened the window to try and reduce this as the hotel is on a main london street the traffic outside was relentless and after half an hour sitting with the window open and the constant noise we realised that the stench was not going to go we went down to reception to ask if we could be moved to another room and were told that all rooms were fully booked but front of house would try to resolve something for us we went back to the room and sat in our coats with the windows open for another hour waiting to hear from reception but heard noting we thought we would have a hot drink whilst waiting this is when we discovered that one cup was clean and one cup has sugary residue in the bottom obviously it had been used and put back then had not been washed by house keeping staff when preparing the room time to turn the kettle on this is when i turned on the socket to the kettle and my arm very slightly brushed the bedside wall light this was extremely loose and swung upside down obviously the cleaning staff must have known about this why wasn t if fixed before a customer had been put into that room i phoned reception to ask what they were actually doing and did not receive any productive input in fact they gave the feeling they had forgotten about us i had to suggest that if we could not be moved could someone at least come to the room with air fresheners and try to ascertain where the smell was coming from as up to then we had made one visit to reception two phone calls and yet not one member of staff had bothered to even view the problems with the room eventually a member of staff turned up with one timed battery air freshener and a can of spray air freshener they agreed the room smell was putrid and overpowering and she was also shown the very loose bedside lamp ,0
 good location friendly staff ,1
 room is too small as well as the bathroom wardrobe is from the wrong side towards the wash basin and bathroom it should be definitely on the other side next to the entrance door in the corridor the magnifier mirror could not be moved freely hairdryer cable is too short the space around the wash basin is so small that one can t put even usual toilet articles tv could not be moved left or right service is not very hospitable staff could not be classified as friendly practically no service at the business center after hours ,0

 old run down hotel,0
 the location and the facilities ,1

 the ubiquitous fitted carpets loved by british hotels always a dust trap ,0
 we went to a concert at the o2 and last minute for ease decided to stay at the hotel we were running late for the start of the concert the staff could not have been more helpful in rushing is over and showing us the way to the o2 the hotel car park was a real bonus too the room was quiet clean and comfortable bed was very comfy great shower coffe machine in room was a bonus i will definitely stay again next time i visit the o2 really recommend it it transformed our evening and enjoyment of it it really is just a 2 minute walk to the o2 ,1
 lovely,1
 bed was comfortable facilities in room were satisfactory ,1
 more than 300 for one night and a bathroom 1 square meter with a lavatory smaller than usually find in airplane room 102 in this case ,0

 the breakfast was delicious and the staff made us feel very welcome the room was clean spacious and had everything we could need ,1
 be careful deposits 50 nonrefundable they will say after 5 days back in your account don t believe them ,0

 superb room 232,1
 lovely quirky hotel close to the tube station and not far from the west end breakfast was very nice if not a little prices,1
 a lot of things for instance aircondition noisy and totally ineffective furniture worn out towels children size service lousy and you are charged for everything staying in hotels more than 30 nights a year i have experienced one with a poorer relationship between price and quality ,0
 good size room and even though i did not use it i liked that there was a kitchen area with a microwave ,1
 second stay here staff are very helpful great location beautiful reception area and lobby area ,1

 even though the room was small the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom totally up to date staff were just wonderful and helpful,1
 staff could not have been kinder conveniently located near the tube for easy access just a few train stops into the city to sightsee and such as well as easy access to the o2 arena the adele concert was the main reason for my visit additionally plenty of places to dine coffee convenience store at within the o2 ,1
 every thing is not for 4 star hotel iron shirt take two days bad cleaning we cant use spa and pool because is booked for out side the hotel even you cant see it no lobby in the hotel we don t have to take a breath in the hotel everything is small ,0

 the room was extremely hot even after the maintenance came the aircon did not work breakfast very basic for the price we paid for a four star hotel the bar serving drinks in plastic cups was disgusting no tea or coffee facilities in the room towels cheap and thin very low standard for the price we paid ,0
 hotel is in an ideal location for visiting all london s sights in vicinity of the south bank and london eye all staff were very pleasant and helpful the room was excellent and very comfortable would happily recommend the hotel to friends and family ,1
 great bed room design nice ,1
 kitchen utility is worst if one microwave and tiny fidge can be designated as kitchen no bowl no plates not even spoon cooking place is very small this place should enlisted under hotel in booking com not in apartments with kitchen facility if you want stay for couple of days with your family and wish to prepare your food by yourself this is worst choice another thing you have to pay full charge during check in before entering the room so you do not have any choice after only facility location is just near the metro station ,0
 we were chosen as guest of the day and got an upgrade breakfast was great so i d book it in future we always enjoy this novotel the staff are very friendly and the rooms are comfortable ,1
 very good value for money fabulous bedroom stayed in the lilly langtry room happy hour each evening staff very accommodating breakfast wonderful,1

 every thing,0
 nice quiet and clean room great location ,1
 too much attention on tech hardware resulting in a less enjoyable experience in term of comfort,0
 no internet or super slow net which was useless receptions prety much unhelful if there wad an issue 4 star should have tea and coffe facility on each room rooms are super tiny if there was enough word space i would convince you to book some where else not recomended ,0
 this hotel is a boutique hotel so everything look old but it works as normal the location is very nice easy go to louvre museum many restaurants nearby and you can find some local coffee shop in the morning the staff is really helpful and friendly,1

 nice and modern great location for visiting concert at o3,1
 regulation,0
 the hotel room was beautiful nice and clean and felt homely staff were friendly and was easily laid out so could find everything wish we had more time to get the full use of what they had to offer because it sounded amazing ,1
 the friendly staff,1
 no hospitality no aircon working breakfast very poor small extremely small not 5 star at all no value for money will not recommend anyone to stay here,0
 perfect to see tennis in o2 arena connecting door easy to come by metro very clean comfortable excellent staff beautiful view on city from 18th floor bar ,1
 helpful staff,1
 a joke calling this a 5 star hotel at best 3 stars in current shape in need of modernization would not recommend staying here,0
 it was a perfect location friendly staff quiet hotel ,1
 food,0
 decor old and tired too noisy lifts didn t work properly which was not good when your room is on 11th had to pay extra to use pool which had no seating area and a spa pool which didn t have proper access ,0
 size of room was poor general condition was poor very noisy from the 1st floor recreation room had to complain 4 times,0
 unfriendly welcome loud guests tired room inhospitable feeling overall,0
 complained 3 x about the hot air coming out of the aircon nothing done once horrible nightmare stay,0
 everything staff was wonderful very very helpful lively but quiet place great location had a nice room the bar too was great ,1
 could not sleep because of the noise of the nearby trains and the neighbors watching tv the walls are very thin ,0
 window didn t close properly and it was freezing at night mattress is awful duvet is really low quality duvet cover does not fit the duvet and linen do not fit the mattress noisy corridor room and bathroom are tiny staff are not very nice ,0
 polite helpful staff comfortable room breakfast excellent,1
 we had a free upgrade to the penthouse suite amazing,1
 the noise from the helicopter pad was constant during the day s the morning service of the room was very poor there was a stale smell in the bathroom the entire time we were there ,0
 room service took over half an hour to tell us they didn t have what we wanted then another half an hour to get a dried up sandwich no butter on the bread no phone in room had to keep walking to reception room blind fell down nearly injured my husband took nearly a hour to sort the end night guy was not a maintenence man he gave my husband a duvet to cover the window no apologies can we move you the continental breakfast was terrible dry cheese and ham hard rolls cereal not a good selection fruit juices nearly run out and tasteless tea and coffee the most cheapest brands on the market the housekeeping on the room was terrible the fridge was filthy the bottles not wiped round the glass all stained the bath panel thick layer of dust the carpet holey dust on ledges the list can go on for the price we paid it did not meet a 4 star standard ,0
 the service is very thoughtful,1
 room size was excellent upgraded to the city view worth every penny to see the sun coming up over london will definitely return check in was seamless although many people checking out dealt with straight away ,1
 cleanliness organization,0
 basically everything the style of the hotel is really great the breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar the wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel the location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center i loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure the staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that thumbs up from me ,1
 light was very bad,0
 the location was good hotel wonderful food staff and so clean will return,1
 the environment around is great a v lib station is in front of the hotel it takes about 30 minutes to go to cath drale norte dame de paris by walking there are some asian style restaurants around the corner for people miss udon with hot soups ,1
 staff,0
 great hotel excellent location friendly staff and i loved my stay,1

 quiet room comfortable beds excellent breakfast ,1
 your beautiful garden,1
 very comfortable clean and well presented room,1
 great location super friendly staff and the cocktails are fabulous,1
 they did not have the room i booked and they tried to send me to another hotel rooms were too small in total far from value for money,0
 it is in a very good location in paris everthing is closed by metro and taxis shopping roads staff were friendly and very clean,1
 very basic room mine was facing the street on a low floor and was very noisy because of the street works you can also hear everything from the corridor and i think there was a service room next to mine too the air con was old and made so much noise that all in all i got 2 very bad nights sleep for the price i paid it s quite shocking what you get breakfast is ok but for the cost you can step outside to have an amazing breakfast down the road for half the cost,0
 comfortable room and good wifi connection,1
 bathroom not as good as i thought it would be waste in wash basin did not flow away,0
 great location for the o2 friendly and helpful staff spacious room good breakfast ,1
 the personnel was really unfriendly right from the start several examples of bad service including the express breakfast regarding transportation to the airport we got false information presumably in order to sell the hotel s own shuttle service i normally like to give nice feedback but in this case i feel responsible of warning others that the quality and price are not a match ,0
 the room s view and location in the building ,0
 i changed my room type from twin to double the day before i arrive and i received the conformation email but they didn t change it and the most unbelievable thing is when we asked their manager for help he just totally don t care about this problem and make no effort at all to help us or explain to us not even said sorry actually he just shake his head said some random words and then walk away by himself ,0
 we got a free upgrade very handy for london eye ,1
 i would highly recommend this hotel from the moment we arrived to the minute we left the staff at the hotel were more than attentive and made our stay very welcoming the hotel surpassed our expectations,1
 little extras made a big difference it was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable there were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved we were a towel short 1 evening 1 phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within 5 minutes the location is superb 5 minutes walk from waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the london eye the south bank a bridge walk to either westminster or soho we were on the 13th floor we could have been in the country it was quiet no road or plane noise at all ,1
 hypnos bed very comfortable we had a refurbished room and it was very nice,1
 located close to paddington station but on a quiet street clean and comfy decent bed decent bathroom friendly staff ,1
 staff were very helpful they even organised a little surprise on my birthday room was great very spacious with huge bed ,1
 i only have one word for this hotel outstanding the rooms were beautiful and so clean and the service was suberb beautifully located and the facilities were amazing our room had thames view which was lovely defiantly be back again,1
 lack of honesty with guest my booking differs from the room that were available to me air conditioning is not good also a liar reception team i would not advise him,0
 the rooms were far too small on the door this is advertised as a 4 hotel which it most certainly is not it s a b b at best no bar no evening catering poor television coverage and poor picture confused booking arrangements pokey bathroom and the shower curtain collapsed the staff did their best but not good enough ,0
 location was spot on,1
 we paid a lot of money for 3 rooms and when we got there are rooms were not ready had to go down to complain 4 times about the same thing so loud at night and people banging on our doors at 2 30am would never step foot in there again,0
 not good value for the price really slow staff poor customer service,0
 very noisy hotel could hear roof top bar in our 3rd third floor room at 12 45 am changed too second floor then we could hear nightclub over the rd plus people in street shouting and fighting until 3 30am thats when the the dust carts and cars started got to sleep 6 30 am breakfast was included in our stay however we were given a price list and were told if we had a full english then we would have to pay extra for anything else ie fruit cereal pastries or toast ,0
 everything,1
 fabulous hotel and very convenient for our trip to the 02 concert venue fabulous view over the river ,1
 decor small uncomfortable bed room too hot aircon useless,0
 we found hotel cold when we tried to put heating up it would go back to setting of 17degrees not very inviting ,0
 the staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning ,1
 the awful smell in the room,0
 food and bars burger super breakfast outstanding the views bright clean brilliant access to arena staff superbly attentive,1
 hotel decor to dark,0
 not very convenient as it is tucked in a residential street and not as close to the main street ,0
 the fact that an executive room was booked over six months ago yet when my partner arrived they were told that the room was unavailable because it was being decorated why did they not notify anyone to add insult they knocked just 50 off the 245 room rate when i checked other sites for the room they had it was cheaper then 195 charged disgraceful way to act particularly as i had phoned the hotel on the friday morning to see if i could pay as this stay was part of a present and was told it was not possible but having given them my details not a single word to say that the room booked was not going to be available ,0
 service room not comfotable,0
 lovely facilities very comfortable staff very attentive gave the impression nothing was too much trouble location also very convenient for the eventim apollo the reason for our trip ,1
 comfortable bed and cosy room ,1
 i ve booked in with my wife and my 10 month old son i requested a baby travel cot the court did not have a mattress and had a folded up blanket which was very very uncomfortable you can literally feel the wood the bed that we were sleeping with in me and my wife was very uncomfortable and the room temperature was an adjustable call reception no 1 turned up what s the weather,0
 as above for the price paid for the hotel you don t get lot for your money bin was not empty on arrival had to wave down my own cab on leaving hotel open the main door myself no concierge in site i paid a lot off money for a nice view which does not even have shelter for the english rainy days no water or fruit within rooms on arrival had to return to reception twice on arrival as door card not working in the end just accepted to use the one card rather than one each for my wife and i very noisy from bar above an overall very bad stay and disappointed in the hotel itself feel like i was robbed in broad daylight with your exspensive rates ,0
 the staff were ver good and friendly,1
 1 front staffs are not friendly and very impolite 2 when i back to th h tel h tel is closed and could not enter 3 amenity is not sufficient and they did not supply when there are not ones 4 breakfast is high price ,0
 the front desk staff was exceptional the nigh shift staff was cherry and helpful a nice bunch i was checked in by gina who professional courteous and very knowledgable all in all an excellent experience,1
 filthy exterior windows hadn t been cleaned for years ceiling mirror tiles near reception had similarly not been cleaned for years in our room the carpet was rotting near the edges the furniture was well worn as was the general decoration the power sockets were a strange mixture of modern uk 3pin and 3pins with large round earth at the top tv was old so no subtitle facility the shower could be set to either scalding hot or freezing cold but nothing in between the beds themselves were of only poor quality ,0
 hotel that i originally booked had a problem with the room so they asked if i would mind being upgraded and transferred to another one of their group hotels i agreed and they provided free transportation refreshments in the bar whilst waiting and a great new location will stay there again ,1
 the room 347 was dark noisy opposite waitrose and d cor tired bar was very dark,0
 the stuffs the services and the way they deal,0
 beds pillows like concrete the finish made it feel cheap dirty the breakfast was awful ,0
 location staff privacy food everything,1
 clean rooms staff friendly and helpful ,1
 the spa is very old and only the hall is nice looking ,0
 hospitality was excellent all staff were polite and helpful would definitely stay again and recommend to friends and family,1
 the staff and management were top class and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them the breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food the rooms were smallish but the service compensated for that thumbs up for this hotel good location just off bayswater road close to queensway and bayswater tube stations ,1
 very stylish location and very nice breakfast buffet for the price rooms fairly small but nicely done and without functional errors ,1
 everything had a nice feel to it the staff were friendly and were always smiling and laughing ,1
 being charged 40 for a very poor buffet cooked breakfast,0
 while i am a client of hotel mercure paris terminus nord i used the bar inside the hotel purchasing a coffee and a juice a member of staff called jonas told me to leave the bar if i finished my drinks i told him that i was a client of the hotel and there were empty chairs and tables in the bar and it was no point to behave like that we told me he did not care about it i found this approach very very rude ,0
 the beds were very poor quality springs in your back premier inn better tee,0
 extremely friendly staff ,1
 very clean modern and spacious room,1
 the adminstration,0
 location was excellent short distance to the station and well connected the internet was great and so was the staff ,1
 lovely friendly staff really fantastic accommodation great breakfast gorgeous room ,1
 lovely building great location nice clean rooms,1
 excellent location staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel saw it was my birthday while i was there and went out of their way to make it special upgraded me to a club room to stay in the room adjacent to my parents who were also there chocolates in the room and a happy birthday message ,1
 the location is great the concierge was helpful but the rest of the staff acted as tired as the decor the room was massive which gave us more space to see it had not been cleaned and smelled of old cigarettes this was not helped by staff smoking outside the bedroom window in the middle of the night we asked for adjoining room we did not get them we asked for baby cots we did not get them and had to ask a number of times before they arrived this was nice as we checked in at midnight and had 2 very tired babies we tired to boil water for the babies night time feed the 1st kettle leaked poaring water all over the desk and 2nd kettle didn t leak but it did cause a power outage in the room we i asked why the room had not been serviced by nearly 5 in the afternoon i was given the answer i don t know i have stayed here before as the location is very good but i would be hard pushed to stay there again and i would not recommend it ,0
 great location and friendly staff,1
 the hotel is rather disorganized and dishonest please check your room charges carefully we paid for an extra bed via booking com a few months ago but was told on check in that the extra bed wasn t paid for and i need to show my bank statements to proof that i ve paid 1st we are traveling getting bank stamenents from a few months back is no easy feat 2nd isn t bank statements private we checked in nonetheless as the kids were tired and hungry after going to our allocated rooms there wasn t an extra bed in any of the rooms and one of the room was filthy enclosed are photos of the cleaner room so you can decide what we meant by filthy we went back down and waited about an hour to speak to the manager we got a change of rooms for the dirtier room but still no extra bed even thou the desk staff said i would be charge an extra 50 a night for it upon check out 3 days later not only was i charged for the extra bed i was also charged for a room upgrade that the manager gave in lieu of the filthy room that amounted to 530 plus 150 for the extra bed that we never got as the kids squeezed in together and that took more than an hour to resolve at check out the rooms are old and in need to major renovation air con is one temp fits all hot or cold low or high you don t have a choice air basically bletching out like a subway running through your room the minibar is empty and room amenities don t get replenished daily when we asked for 2 extra pillows the 1st night we were told there is none and if we insist they will try to find it vacuum cleaner fm housekeeping is stored outside our room on the hallway for the 4 days 3 nights we were there this is truly a hostel or budget hotel at best interestingly upon check out there were 3 staff manning the reception and all 3 were handling unhappy guests at check out something is very wrong with this property ,0
 very firm but comfortable bed large room with sofa ,1
 there was mould in the bathroom ceiling in the upgraded room the curtain rod was rusty and tiles and toilet was dirty ,0
 having arrived at the hotel the staff member checking me in asked if i wanted to upgrade to a bigger room i said no then she asked if i wanted to pay twenty pounds more per night for a newly refurbished room and i said why should i have to pay more for it and are the rooms clean and allergy free she said no that the other rooms were older and i asked how old she asked her colleague and they had a right old laugh saying it was about the 1970s at that point i was already upset and i said just give me the room that i paid for i believe it was room 1216 upon entering the room the carpet was stained the windows open mold on the windows bedding covered in dust i closed the window due to the dust and then smelled vomit at which point i felt physically ill my husband and i said this was unacceptable and went back to reception we went back to reception and spoke to another desk member which we explained the upset that this was causing us and i was almost in tears as i was so distressed having just arrived here expecting a reputable hotel to be better than this julian another member of staff overheard us as he was checking out another guest and advised the colleague to upgrade us to the newly refurbished room we thanked him and told him to check the room out that they originally assigned us as no one should have to sleep in those conditions ,0
 room was very small was not comfortable and could of done with a good clean not value for money,0
 the staff were uninviting and seemed a little dissatisfied with anything i asked for i am usually a happy traveller and used to smiles and courtesy i felt like i was staying in a boarding school rather than a hotel where i was briskly told off for not handing keys the atmosphere was cold the hotel is not the pretty boutique hotel i thought it would be it was cold predominantly because of the staff ,0
 this establishment can in no way be considered anywhere near four star standard tired dated shabby at best it s two star standard charging the rates it does its a rip off ,0
 poor value tiny room can get much better in a more central location for a similar rate ,0
 in my whole experience in this hotel the lobby staff where always rude and unrespectful at all especially with platinum members the treat you as if your such a dumb and doesn t understand a word which i ve tried the whole worlds most luxurious hotels no one have ever treated me that kind of way and thank you ,0
 location for me and comfort and staff were helpful,1
 dirty rooms small rooms bad room service,0
 the staff were attentive friendly and helpful it was in a good location ideal for the tube the facilities in the room were good ,1
 asked for an early check in got an early check in no fuss,1
 fantastic location both central but quiet ,1
 the service reception concierge room service maintenance housekeeping overall was good efficient and friendly used room service three times the service and food was of a consistently good standard ,1
 furniture was scratched walls scuffed stains on bedding stains on carpet keycards useless missing drain cover in shower shower head full of lime scale and scum mould on bathroom ceiling staff unapologetic and unhelpful won t stay again ,0
 it was noisy the window is towards a noisy street and the air conditioner did not work properly the room also has a strange style which should not be qualified as a four star hotel ,0
 friendly and helpful staff bakery and grocery store across the street ,1

 the hotel and its staff cannot do enough me and my wife visted london for her 30th birthday once guest relations knew the reason of our stay they gave us certain little perks to make our stay the best it possibly could be and they did not disappoint thank you to novotel certainly the only hotel in london i will stay at from now on ,1
 great tv channels and bed was definitely soft as a cloud bathroom was very nice too and shower pressure was top notch,1
 the room was small and had received what must of been a very basic clean so it was quite dirty in the corners and dusty throughout generally very old decor greatly in need of investment to update it odd perfumed scent attempted to mask the old smell in the room when we first walked in the heating didn t work properly so they had a little heater on full blast when we arrived it must of been running all day as the room was like a sauna the mattress was unbelievable uncomfortable with broken springs in places the bedding was clean but didn t smell fresh like they d been through a very hot wash thousands of times but never replaced all in all a hotel where the staff are great but let down hugely by lack of investment and proper cleaning ,0
 when i came my room was uncleaned staff was rude,0
 the hotel is having building work done we tried to check in at 13 00hrs the room wasn t ready that was ok but when returned to the hotel hours later the room still wasn t ready and we had to wait 40 minutes ,0

 terrible customer service appalling checked in at 10am asked for an upper storey twin room both prior to arriving by email and phone on arrival was allocated a basement double room with no windows or ventilation which we had to wait 8 hours to get in to booking com allowed cancellation and we were left to find another central london hotel at 9pm on a saturday night very obstructive and rude customer service dishonest hotel lies about availability of rooms then took a large unauthorised charge for two nights from my credit card under the name hogarth hotel thinking that i would not notice then booking com asked them to refund it and they wouldn t awful experience terrible hotel big mistake,0

 there was a mouse that had free run of the empty restaurant area from 10pm onwards it was skating across the polished floor and even made it onto the chairs to find crumbs etc so a friend and i watched it for a bit over a few beers quite funny actually until it made its way into the bar to clean up the peanut debris left by the humans i told the staff but they seemed unconcerned and said i could leave if i wanted which would ve been fine if i hadn t have been staying there anyway i decided to call it a night i went to my room and was then serenaded for an hour or so by a coo ing pigeon that lived in some kind of wooden box outside my window if i d have wanted to spend the evening with the local wildlife i would have brought a sleeping bag slept on a roundabout and saved 100 very poor stay and experience never again however i m sure the mouse pigeon would disagree with me they were very comfortable ,0

 you get what you pay for i guess oh plus 21 to park 7 wifi 4 to use the so called filthy gym and you want a window with that room a further 20 rooms are tired and extremely worn out very hot and uncomfortable air con very noisy staff inattentive and miserable worth paying extra to stay elsewhere and have all the above included i guess never again seems quite standard from britannia from what i have also heard countrywide avoid ,0
 hairs in bed and in bathroom no air con working bar water leaked from fridge ,0
 room service terrible food tastes like plastic check in not friendly lots of noise brunch parties soundproof yes but if you are a regular person trying to rest not even think about it i told them i needed a silent room etc i guess silence and peace are not they specialty the contrarie noise and other business we were given a false flag fire alarm it did not happen they choosed our room to do it why three or four guys invaded our room kicking and knocking our door police harassment alike they threatned us i will call the police asked me to return a complimentary wine was already pre set i myself returned due the terribly embarassing surreal situation in a so called 5 hotel could be 1 respect has no stars i will call the police someone said the so called manager a guy with kind of blond short cut hair not much taller than myself we had a train to catch next morning a lot of luggage was surreal we should call the police but i just wanted to leave that place totally in panic by their approach and dare the they finsbury park occured guess the police had more to do they made up a false fire alarm in our room which they check did not exist at all i was in my underwear and they came in even tough just ours we coincidently had a reservation to the end of our trip but also interestantly i was called earlier and politely ansewered that we changed our plans and that s all that is how they treat you if you doesn t like the place even though i did not mentioned it they threw us to the streets with 7 pieces of luggage i was told to leave immediately lost the money they charged every single thing and also charge and extra night i had to communicate my credit card management no problem but this kind of people took care of me as the reception desk and a so called manager said ,0

 the hotel was old worn and run down the receptionist was rude the room was tired and old the bed uncomfortable and the parking costs disgusting to park in a underground hole filled with furniture for the hotel,0
 the rooms are tiny and not suitable for 2 adults plus luggage the bed was comfortable though regardless of the facilities the staff is not qualified to handle any problems on the day of our arrival the elevator broke down and was broken for the entire stay we were a family of 5 staying in 3 rooms for 5 days all situated on different floors second third and the fourth you can imagine the stairs we had to climb during the whole day there were construction work going on in the building so it was best to stay out for the whole day then the reception was moved into a room on the ground floor because of some construction work that was supposed to start after the weekend but hadn t started when we left all that fuss and confusion for nothing all our communication with the reception team was really awkward and they seemed to be in a hurry to do something else i take my hatt off though for the bell boy who had to carry all our luggage up and down the stairs the only thing we got out of them was we are sorry for the inconvenience we were not compensated in any way at all or were invited to move to a lower floor not even invited to have breakfast for free or something they didn t seem to care at all they even ordered us a cab that was way more expensive than a regular cab and smaller just go for a london cab with a meter not the ones they call ,0
 location,1
 lovely quiet setting nice breakfast good service great gym,1
 the restaurant service was a disgrace on the 1st evening we waited so long for our meal that we ended up eating separately as half the table did not have their meals on the next day for breakfast we asked for boiled eggs and they had never been cooked 2 raw eggs served utter disgrace ,0

 run down poor facilities ,0
 the room was realy too small not confortable ,0
 family room accommodation smelt bad foisty like mouldy potatoes one member of staff rude about refusal to pay room security deposit of 150 on top of cost of accommodation and about not wishing to have confidential documents like drivers licence or passport photocopied also photocopies not being returned on departure shower height adjuster was broken and wouldn t stay in height position tap in kitchen was also dodgy finally the showers were cold would not recommend to stay here ,0

 efficient service comfortable clean rooms ,1
 we stayed here before in the garden suite and that experience is why we returned it turns out the rest of the rooms or at least the room we were given was nothing like the garden suite so tiny we could turn around a tiny window we couldn t see out of and the noisy air conditioner was so loud we felt like we were in a fish tank we were so disappointed lucky we were able to change rooms for the second night but you could be the unlucky one who gets the fish tank also the hotel is a bit out of the way so hope you enjoy walking we were also not impressed with the desk the first time we were here about 4 years ago the staff was very attentive this time hardly though the luggage porter was hard working and very nice in the end we were extremely disappointed and wished we hadn t stayed here way over priced ,0

 the ceiling was linking and they wanted to transfer us to a room on the basement a lot smaller than the one we had only the next day after a huge argument suddenly they found one decent available room very rude manager the worse hotel i ve been the last ten years too old without facilities not even a decent coffee area would not recommend for any reason ,0

 the executive king room was very small the elevator was not working for 10 days the nespresso machine and the minibar were inside the cuberd which was not easy to use ,0
 when j arrived i had to wait 30 minutes to check in my room which was not in the main building was across the road the room was on the third floor up a narrow stair case 61 steps to be exact the room was no bigger than a walk in wardrobe i was so disappointed with this hotel wasn t worth over 100 00 a night ,0

 no welcome drink it was me alone but they charged me a tourist tax for 2 persons ,0
 friendly attentive efficient staff close to heathrow express pubs and restaurants ,1
 the room is too small and was not good as expected ,0
 our room was really run down and was like a sauna we called reception and they came and opened a window but still didn t cool the room down worst night sleep ever bearing in mind this was december,0
 ac is not working and staff is arrogant as well non supportive ,0
 loved the staff the concierges serge v dario bernard and max all of them wonderful and lorenzo at the front desk i plan to post a physical letter to the hotel to cite all these people and like arnold s i ll be back ,1

 allocate a room next to railway line unable to sleep moved rooms approx 12 45am next room so cold heating not working vomit in the lift terrible night and had to attend an interview early morning ,0
 wireless did not work and i ended up having to use the restaurant wireless instead several guests complained and were told that it was their computer set up which was not correct i would not recommend the hotel and would suggest others at similar pricing ,0
 although booked the delux double room the room is very too small we can t walk after stayed two baggages in the room and easily strike on the furniture we booked two double rooms two months ago but hotel was allotted us one studio room in the first night due to all rooms were fully booked and had assigned to other customers they had not yet reserved two rooms for us so my relative and me were separated to lived in the housekeeping was not clean the housekeeper didn t clean a cup or glass after used and amenity was not adquate overall the standard of hotel was not given us good impression,0
 the way the toilet and kitchen area separated the rooms my watch and file i left in the room was returned the next week ,1
 staff the most lovely and helpful people ever ,1
 they left the window open so i had to sleep with my jack on also someone put the don t disturb card in the room and the housekeeper did not clean the room ,0
 it was near the train station,1
 the room was too small and noisy the staff were the rudest i ve ever encountered ,0
 the location was great the staff were always very friendly the room was clean,1
 lovely view from suite of london eye,1
 parking was appalling and one of the reception staff was particularly unhelpful my daughter was booked in a suite to ensure that she had a good night s sleep before her wedding but the allocated room was next to a lift and she was disturbed by residents and then again by delivery vehicles at 5 am reversing into the loading bay below the room ,0
 this hotel is a poor excuse for a 4 star my bed linens were torn and had holes the shower tub had cracks the bathroom floor was frozen cold and there were no slippers in the room nor robes by the way the room in itself was cold i increased the temperature of the heater but it didn t change anything the mattress needed to be refreshed overall highly disappointed ,0
 the room smelled suite 1 like an old basement when we opened the fridge to grab a drink we found an old pack of prunes partly decomposed inside there was a problem with the hot water and we did not have any during our stay we had to engage with the manager to receive a compensation which was more of a joke than a partial reimbursement ,0
 everything,1
 staff was not luxury hotel caliber hyde bar staff was not high end caliber rooms are outdated moldy smell fixtures falling apart and no nespresso machine for luxury,0
 smallest hotel room i ve ever stayed in had to move my bag around to move in the room feet touched the wall in the bed iron smoked when i turned it on reception smelled of overpowering cleanly products really noisy as the exterior window had been nailed open and there was just a single pane of extra glazing uncomfortably hot very pleased to leave in the morning ,0
 room was very small bathroom very small and there was a terrible smell on the whole floor which you smelt when you got out of lift and in the room u mentioned it to reception and the girl said yes i know there is a problem with the drains and we have tried to get someone to fix it she offered us a complimentary cup if coffee not impressed,0
 small rooms no air conditioning no fridge staff wasn t helpful at all doing the minimum job ,0
 comfortable stay and pleasant staff,1
 room was amazing and the bed was awesome ,1
 it was good comfortable stay ,1
 small baths bad cleaning the bathrooms smelled to urinate small room uncomfortable poor care to enter very basic breakfast options it is a very basic hotel to be 4 star ,0
 very helpful staff at the front desk and our room was spacious and very comfortable,1
 breakfast was very good variety great service at breakfast very good thoroughly enjoyed breakfast ,1
 room was clean,1
 room i got should be a broom room or some staff room it was the size of a single bed so small and with a view on some giant pipe horrific this room was 170 ,0
 room was too small next door guests was loud banging doors and couldn t sleep all night,0
 bed good room d cor excellent bathroom top quality balcony lovely ,1
 que at reception upon arrival lack of staff rooms not ready even after 3pm said they had been busy 20 minute que to just get to breakfast lack of staff cleaning tables etc left to the lady checking people in to breakfast to do hot food was cold no juice or glasses to put it in even if there were juice coffee with no milk kept having to ask total lack of management or staff to run a hotel of this size,0
 1 the attitude of the staff except for the concierge sucks major they are all argumentative unhelpful and aggressive in their stance against you i found it a real turn off 2 the air conditioning in the room sucked in spite of having it on fan speed 3 and 18c degrees the room was always warm the a c is just old and decrepit it is totally unable to cool down a room 3 rooms were not ready when promised at all in spite of arriving early and the sour faced russian woman on the front desk pointedly commenting that check in time was 2 pm the rooms were not ready until 2 30 pm 4 one room was supposed to have a double bed they gave us a king they promised to separate the king into two beds never did 5 the second room was supposed to be a king they gave us a queeen promised to find us another room never did 6 the hotel is really far away from the tube 7 paid wifi in this day and era this millenium is a sad sad hotel nothing compared to the one in ny which is amazing i am never going to stay in it again total waste of money ,0
 location good quality hotel clean staff were helpful and polite,1
 decor was lovely nice clean room helpful staff good location really liked the theatre bar for our pre theatre drinks ,1
 cold iced water when requested nothing was too much trouble perfect location ,1
 room was shabby furniture was chipped bathroom was old i would not stay there again hotel needs some money spent on it,0
 the rooms were very small we booked room for 2 persons but we got room for 1 person if you enter the room you can olly lie in bed ,0
 hotel was excellent clean friendly helpful staff had a wonderful nights sleep usually on a saturday night in hotels you expect to be woken at least once by guest returning to their rooms this did not happen at all we were able to leave our luggage at reception and collect it when it was time for our train leaving us free to explore without worrying about caring our case withy us we even had a lovely young lady offer to carry our case out to the pavement for us which we declined but the gesture was lovely loved the apex rubber duck will be taking that on my travels and posting pictures to website ,1
 the worst hotel i have stayed in the carpets were thread bare the curtains did not meet making sleep difficult there was no room service there were no coffee making facilities the corridors were partially blocked with laundry carts there were bare electric wires hanging in the corridors had the payment not been taken from my bank before my stay i would not have paid on the grounds that it was just not worth the amount i may seek legal advice over this matter 4 stars definitely not ,0
 the ac is not working in all the floors and room was very hot staff was not helpful at all ,0
 the room type superior double room was very small about 5 s m with no window ,0
 poor mattress dirty carpet grim view with old take away bag outside window enclosed space breakfast very poor cheap products restaurant not designed well tables too close to each other toaster broken ,0
 clever design made use of a small space so we never felt uncomfortable or cramped in the room good hanging and storage space luxurious bathroom generous breakfast buffet with a varied range of foods and helpful staff at reception the location is perfect for exploring paris on foot or by metro very good value for money we would stay here again ,1
 ac wasn t working when i complaint about it someone came in to fix i was hoping that he will fix the ac but to my surprise he let the window open and let the natural cold air come in to cool the room so not sure if the room given to me was ac or go natural room worst experience,0
 location staff value for money ,1
 tiny cramped room hotel had few facilities and lacked atmosphere had to walk to another hotel to get breakfast ,0
 the restroom is horrible the room is so small bad is for small person the price is high,0
 fabulous location small but very well designed room staff were lovely breakfast was good ,1
 we where not in maon hotal and we where 2 streets away and the room was basic and small and the bathroom was rediculouse loose tap shower that you hit your head on when you got in and out room very very hot no air con terrible esspecaly as it was my partners birthday treat,0
 the staff as well as the location and the tabouli rooms make this an ideal hotel for myself and partner to stay at every month when we are in london,1
 i asked for a wake up call at 7am i didn t receive one at all and when i checked out 2 hours later than expected the receptionist simply said oh sorry thanks you re all checked out that didn t go down well when i was late for work the mattress i slept on may as well have been made from bones with a few springs in the middle singularly the most uncomfortable bed of my existence on this planet the free wifi was only available in the lobby of the hotel despite being told the hotel offered free wifi throughout seen as that was 9 floors below me and i would have to wait for the slowest lift in the world that was non existent ,0
 the staff were friendly the room didn t want for anything the ensuite was large and modern breakfast was fabulous ,1
 excellent breakfast and good service very comfortable room and bed personal touch of card and cake for anniversary proximity to st james park and buckingham palace for a walk the morning after our celebration dinner ,1
 good location clean room comfortable beds very close to queensway tube station within walking distance of museums v a natural history museum etc and into city centre 20 30 minutes with lots to see on the way overall a good hotel and location for the price i paid would stay there again ,1
 ambience of lobby lounge and attentiveness of staff ,1
 too many things to mention the room that we were given was on the lower ground floor although we had booked a deluxe double room for two nights and pause euros 670 and the excuse given was that rooms on the higher floors were not ready since we arrived early this was nonsense since we were booked for two nights and we arrived early on the second day clearly the room was given to some other customer the reception staff was rude and unhelpful and we felt cheated and mistreated the room was tiny our luggage hardly fitted in and was very noisy with a distinct smell of damp we would never return to this hotel ever again not even pass outside ,0
 its good,1
 room was way too small in the eves on the 4th floor the hotel was mid way through renovations and all seemed to be a mess way too expensive under those circumstances ,0
 friendly and helpful staff who also let us store our luggage following check out the beds were very comfy even the sofabed good shower my friend s and i were very impressed i would definitely stay again ,1
 bed was comfortable and room was clean ,1
 on arrival we were told that there was a problem with rooms they did not have the 2 rooms that we had booked i see from tripadvisor that this has happened to others we were given the option of 3 of us sharing a room not suitable or an upgrade to an apartment in kensington as it was london marathon weekend we had little option than accept the apartment offered the apartment was very basic smelly noisy we were travelling with a visitor from switzerland felt very embarrassed annoyed to have to stay in these apartments would never book the commodore again we were also charged a 100 room deposit ,0
 front desk concierge services above expectations ,1
 the reception staff were abrupt and unhelpful daniel didn t offer help with luggage and didn t provide information how to find room the room has inadequate curtains to block out the light they are four strips of material but the biggest concern was there was a blood stain on the underneath of the bedding that we discovered when turning down the bedding to get in we paid a significant sum to stay in this hotel and when we checked out early and told daniel the problems we were not offered any recompense the room 522 was also very noisy located near a fire door that constantly banged we left early ,0
 no bar and no one told us there was a mini fridge in our room with no bottle opener,0
 bed was hard and uncomfortable room temperature was 35 degrees and the concierge had to come up to unscrew my window to open it ,0
 this hotel was a great value near the tube station in earl s court it was one of the few places in london that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter it was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything there was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring ,1
 i have been charged twice for spending one night this problem is still being resolved i have called them three times in the the past hour and have yet to get a phone call back i spoke to imran and a gentleman named remy who said he would call me back in a few minutes but hasn t it s been over an hour i have been charged 360 extra for reasons that i do not know ,0
 room was extremely tiny small double bed with barely room to get around it but the bed was clean and comfortable excellent staff and very convenient location ,1
 good location near bercy village and park the breakfast was extensive unfortunately the scrambled eggs were cold ,1
 as your room isn t ready at 7 30pm and you have to wait 30 minutes more in the bar well i don t know how long we had to wait if i checked in at 3pm if i go to the reception after 30 minutes for asking if the room was ready and an explanation for the problem the front office lady said easily sorry we had a problem we had to do the evening service and had to change the towels hey hello we haven t check in at the room so there s nothing to be changed and for sure no towels than after the check in the curtains were electric to open and to close a really bad luck because one side was only closing so we mentioned it at the reception and the would handle it when i was on my way to the restaurant but bad luck again the curtains were in the same position as before last but not least the day after in the morning at 9am a waiter knocked at the door for a room service breakfast again bad luck because i haven t order no breakfast at all for a stay of 350 a night without breakfast i could find better places in the city of love ,0
 have stayed here before and love this hotel for the location it s a15min taxi from st pancras close to trafalgar sq somerset house the river tate modern st paul s the oldest pub in london many theatres the rooms are very well appointed and the friendly courteous staff make this a special place to stay there is also a very nice tapas bar next door ,1
 came for 1 night stay for my birthday with fiance on arrival room was upgraded room to a suite letter of welcome box of chocolates and bottle of wine in room from general manager decor is stunning throughout especially the beautiful theatre bar got a great last minute deal through booking com so all this for less than a travelodge ,1
 everything,0
 bed comfortable bar area surrounding area,1
 bartender front desk staff were very kind ,1
 this has been the worst hotel experience of my life the room was small my bed was under a slanted roof only had blind windows the curtains didn t keep the light out and the airconditioning next to my bed was extremely noisy even in off mode even earplugs could not resolve this all this for 263 euro night and under the hilton brand hotel not reachable by tube ,0
 location to venue visited,1
 it s advertised as a 4 hotel however i have stayed in hostels with better quality than this hotel i would not recommend to anyone as i had to complain twice to get my room changed as it was not what i payed for the shower as you can see in the pic i have posted the door is the opening forward so if you wanted to close to have a shower you would have to be a skinny minny to do it so otherwise you wouldn t be able to close the door ,0
 the young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful dinner has been cooked excellent ,1
 breakfast was not good do not pay the 12 for breakfast it is so not worth it and very poor the room was super tiny for the price that we paid for it was definitively not worth it value for money was not good the bed was along side 3 walls no space to move around had to jump in and out of bed and try not to wake up my husband as i was trying to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night just know that everything was so compact in that room even the bathroom if you re doing anything you re grazing the walls so very very uncomfortable location was ok walking distance from paddigton station which was the only good thing about this hotel also the staff at the reception were so rude unfriendly and not accommodating at all which you wouldn t expect this from a 4star hotel i don t know if the receptionist was having a bad day but we have never been checked in with such unfriendliness also it does not mention that the the rooms are in another building just annoying than anything else i will definitively not be coming back here only if you find an amazing deal you should book here and not expect anything nice but if you can t find a better deal at this hotel my advise book somewhere else ,0
 perfect location nice and clean hotel highly recommended ,1
 the duvet on the single bed in twin room didn t cover my feet it was too small and i m only 5 6 two men came to the door and said they needed to check the mattresses for two girls who were staying this was quite intimidating especially because the reception staff had not called to let us know that checks were being carried out ,0
 special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel relaxed atmosphere nice restaurant and bar area with terasse good accessibility of public transport ,1
 a room that was booked and paid for as superior and was in the basement cellar with windows that looked out onto dingy storage cupboards paid and booked for breakfast not cheap that turned out to be continental with an additional charge of 25 to upgrade to cooked not impressed,0
 good accomodation at a reasonable price fairly near to kings cross station the bed was extremely comfortable and the bar staff friendly and helpful ,1
 all staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 top floor rooms are tiny so if you want space dont request the top floor honestly great location tube station 2mins walk away breakfast terrible,0
 convenient location good service,1
 lovely decor downstairs the theatre bar was quaint to ,1
 price value total rip off very old and unconvenient facilities mainly shower staff was unfriendly and not professionnal at all no a c couldnt sleep whole night,0
 6 flights of stairs break fast room tight and very stressful room was at an angle so was bed told only room left as fully booked ,0
 very comfortable bed quiet room very pleasant open bar area,1
 great location quiet room had everything you need in room,1
 no air con had to change rooms late at night rooms tired and need upgrading poor decor breakfast was very poor coffee from a flask very poor value for money at 127 quid per night ,0
 bed was comfy room was quiet and food was really good,1
 the stuff was bad very bad bad bad,0
 hotel staff was not cooperating at all beds were separated spring mattress were paining in back like hell bathroom sinks were choked had to brush in bath tubs cleaning staff was pathetic swimming pool was chargeable internet wi fi was free for a whole 20 minute session in whole day and that too in hotel lobby and not in room overall the property was not value for money at all and staying there was a nightmare ,0
 staff are polite and courteous room was nice and bed was comfy good selection at breakfast freshly cooked and hot ,1
 we liked the location good buzz felt safe with many good restaurants and supermarkets close to metro the staff were very welcoming and accommodating the room was small but not tiny and very clean the bed was very comfortable wifi was very good we would definitely return ,1
 location of the hotel and safety when walking around city view was exactly how it was described ,1
 location good a lot of restaurants around the hotel cinema cafes shops metro station grocery shop also not too far from hotel rooms are wide very good space free to move around also the shower and toilet and of course i should not forget the staff are very good ,1
 i was disgusted at the size of my room for 99 pound i basically got a space that i couldn t even turn around in i was awake all night and then to make things worse the woman at the desk told me breakfast started at 6am it didn t it was 7am so i missed it there are far better rooms in other hotels for the same price,0
 excellent service rx,1
 the hotel itself was stunning and very well kept the rooms were a great size and very well laid out the staff were very friendly and helpful myself and my partner had an excellent experience here and will definitely be returning,1
 basement room avoid at all costs like a sweat box choose between noisy air conditioning or silence and heat shower was useless scalding hot shower head kept flicking up into my face then a tiny towel breakfast poor soulless little room scrambled eggs watery bacon part undercooked and part overlooked this is a guest house dressed up it is not as someone said elsewhere the best hotel in london for those who don t know a good hotel when they see one ask yourself why this is available when everything else is full ,0
 noise room electronic not working no response of management to complaints,0
 all was of high standard ,1
 actually when i booked online the rooms were showing on the picture large and nice but when i arrived they gave me a smallest room even i couldn t move inside the room and i didn t have an enough space to put my bag and my personal stuff i was suffering at night from the other people because i can hear everything from the rooms ,0
 we got an 8th floor room using the elevator was difficult because one didn t bring to 8th floor also the room had a very cold and noisy ventilation from the roof they had to apply some tape to cover the air entrance ,0
 fabulous staff great location would recommend to everyone ,1
 good,0
 the hotel was undergoing construction and we were not inform during booking ,0
 large clean rooms with a nice size comfy bed all round just very clean ,1

"stayed here for 3 nights with my 2 best friends. we had a spacious corner room on the 11th floor that had great views overlooking zaandam.   room is very basic = 3 beds (1 double + 1 single) shower + a tv (no english channels) rooms were not cleaned whilst we were there but you get additional towels etc from reception. beds were very comfortable.   great location, train station literally a 2 min walk away. lots of shops (primark/zara/h&m) very picturesque.  would not recommend if you are looking to go & party - very quiet nightlife. most restaurants are closed by 10pm.   all staff we encountered were polite & helpful.  i would stay here again due to the location. ",1

 staff room convenience to the o2 but most of all the superb breakfast what a spread ,1

 i do not know why when i book offers for this hotel via booking com they always give me a problematic rooms noisy cold with much noise from the radiator my staying there was a nightmare i could not sleep well because of the strong noise last time the same are we b class customers buying discounted rooms if so do not book using booking com i am fed up with this hypocrite strategy from hotel and from booking com maybe ,0
 the room came supplied with utensils should we wish to have our own breakfast in the room after not including it during our stay,1
 stuff are so so rude room is very small toilet smells so bad ,0
 everything extremely run down rooms windows that don t lock but are easy to open with one finger i didn t like the fact that they charged me 10 hour for my room that was already ready a strange man entered my room with a key whole i was sleeping and the hotel had no explanation but that i should think nothing of it i was nervous to sleep both nights i was there to top it off the front desk man had horrendous body odour i will never go back ,0

 beautiful room superb shower room ,1
 everything,0
 firstly hotel is trying to manipulate the room spec they offer standard room w o window as a cheapest option but even if you choose executive room with king size bed you will learn that it can be blind room so small that you cannot fully open doors to bathroom cause they are blocked by the bed room 124 for example extra 50 night is fee for king size bed as i learned from receptionist rotfl as it occurred there are executive and executive rooms the true executive rooms are with window fridge and decent in size the other executive rooms have no window no fridge and are so small you cannot even enter bathroom no clue in what way they are assigned to guests secondly heating in the rooms is not working and requires strong argue to make it operating after several trials central a c started to operate however due to broken temperature sensors it was switching on and off constantly with no possibility to heat the room decently thirdly there was no possibility to take shower without flooding all bathroom as doors to the shower didn t close fourthly rooms were generally dirty windows in rooms could be opened as they are nailed to the wall room 115 and i suppose they were cleaned last time when queen victoria was ruling the uk in bathrooms you can find variety of life forms between tiles on walls and floor inside the sink in the shower hotel offers black cups for do it yourself tea would be nice if they are washed when doing rooms in each of rooms we were the cups were dirty after the night before guests we washed them but let s not play the game it was an ugh experience finally the card i used for booking com reservation has been charged for the stay without my acceptance on checkout it occurred payment was already done by night watch to speed up checkout ,0
 the location was ideal for the theatre that we had booked and all the staff in the hotel were very helpful and curtious ,1
 the room was at 6th floor which was great upgraded the room by 10 to a deluxe sized room which was significantly larger everything was great toilet was superb love the hotel alot i would come again for sure ,1
 bed was great spacious rooms and bathroom ,1
 excellent service great breakfast efficient staff clean and modern room was small but extremely comfortable,1
 great service friendly staff and perfect location we were lucky enough to have the room upgraded and so it simply could t have been better ,1
 staff were very helpful and friendly close to 2 underground stations very quiet in hotel room we stayed in a room over the courtyard ,1
 i love the location and working wi fi,1
 so me and my girlfriend both 18 arrived at the hotel i booked us a king room when we arrived at our room the bed was smaller than the average double bed even though it s supposed to be a king and the carpets were stained everywhere the view was terrible and the tv said that it was going to be hd and 40 but that didn t happen the tv we were given was not hd atall and it certainly wasn t 40 so i went down to reception to complain and ask for us to be moved to a king sized room once i asked them that they obviously realised that they had put us in a standard double room i mean it could have been a simple mistake but it definatly didn t feel like one it felt like the members of staff had just seen 2 teens coming for a romantic night in a hotel so they thought they would give us a terrible room it was disgusting and i don t undertstand why they would feel the need to place us in a worse room than what i had paid for like we pay the same as everyone else so why not treat us the same just because we may be younger than your usual guests anyway once we got given the room we eventually paid for it was exactly what it said on the tin except the view could have been a bit better ,0
 the man in charge of the reception desk could be the owner the nametag read yohann was unbelievably impatient and rude ,0
 absolutely wonderful staff was especially helpful on tips on how to get around london through the faster and cheapest routes loved everything ,1
 went the extra mile to help us celebrate my son s 10th birthday top marks ,1

 very thin walls and cramped very cold also and inconsiderate cleaners,0
 very comfy bed and fantastic breakfast,1
 we felt so well looked after there are only 50 rooms so you feel like you have the run of the place and the staff couldn t do enough to help we had a late saturday night dinner in the brumus restaurant which was also excellent the location is perfect very close to the theatres restaurants and bars but just tucked away in a quiet side street fantastic experience we have already booked again for december ,1
 excellent extensive breakfast friendly helpful service super quiet room allowing sound night s sleep easy access to central london ,1
 service too slow breakfast with long queues room ready at 4 30 pm after we were told it would be ready at 2,0
 room was smelly and the alternative arrangement was to upgrade at a cost ridiculous customer service they also took money as a deposit rather than just swiping card i booked this as a special treat for 40th birthday disappointing service have had better in 3 star by far ,0
 sold as including breakfast no breakfast supplied also booking com refused to give any type of refund and accidentally sent me a copy of an email intended for the hotel asking them to change their advertisement the room was for two people and was a box room where you couldn t even walk around the beds the room was below grond onto the main street the place was dirty ,0
 bed really comfy and concierge very helpful with timetables etc ,1
 i loved the refurbished rooms,1
 very tired eg ageing ripped wallpaper small old fashioned bathroom spluttering plumbing ,0

 staff room and the view,1
 the very false welcome from mina the guest relations woman who really only wanted your name address date of birth telephone number and email so she could get her bonus for selling your details on don t be taken in by its great to have you guys here its great for her she does not need any details ,0
 we checked in dog tired after 4pm hoping to go straight into our room but the room was just about to be cleaned we lugged our cases down to the lobby and did not enter our room till around 5pm ,0
 this place is collectoon of all things not to be liked this hotel sorry hostel is overpriced relative to what you get and ehat they deliver both from a staff point of view and facilities stay here just if this place is your only survival chance after a zombie or nuclear catastrophe ,0
 staff location decor and history of building,1
 the entrance and outside of the hotel was amazing it is located a 5 minute walk away from euston and right outside a tube station staff were friendly and nice and the concierge desk took our luggage even after we had checked out so we didn t have to carry it all over london on our last day ,1
 very convenient to queensway tube stop and hyde park room was good size ,1
 the room was cold and the bathroom heater was broken no refund or discount when asked they offered other rooms but they were no better and colder ,0
 room and bathroom were shabby looked nothing like what is advertised stale unpleasant odour in room loud music noise from the street until 4am despite requesting a quiet room ,0

 location ok room nice ,1

 excellet location close to pblic transportation staff was very polite and helpful ,1
 the hotel was under renovation ,0
 the staff were attentive and extremely polite i had a poster from the concert i went to and when leaving luggage the next day i asked if my poster could be taken extra care of and the staff wrote that on the luggage tag it s the little things that make a big difference the rooms were beautiful and it was a perfect location for our use of the o2 arena spotlessly clean and very luxurious ,1
 went and eat in the sports bar couldn t even eat the food as the fish was gone off and the chicken was so over cooked plus you put parmesan cheese on the cheesy chips which smelt,0
 not convenient did not even have a charger when asked for window was open resulting in a strong wind blow had to call twice access to cw has also been reduced till 2020 resulting in a longer walk,0
 the view,1

 excellent staff could not of tried any harder to please me and my family claudio is a hugh credit to crown plaza ,1
 hotel was amazing very clean and a lovely modern decor too a great location within paris ,1
 we were in a room near the breakfast room staff were speaking so loud at 6 30 in the morning that it woke us up also the noise of guests and crockery was loud so we didn t get much sleep this room should not be used as a bedroom as it s far too close to the dining area altogether very disappointed with our stay and bad value for money ,0
 size of room no air con poor bed no proper wardrobe,0
 super tiny rooms uninterested staff,0
 very clean,1
 its just a nice atmosphere in the hotel and i have stayed there on many occasion,1
 very very nice stuff reasonable location near a small park near the british museum and the underground beautiful lobby,1
 incredible exterior best location,1
 a nice surprise to be upgraded for both rooms i d booked and guest of the day status staff were friendly and helpful location so close to apollo is a good reason for staying comfortable with good bar and restaurant facilities ,1
 the location was key close to the london eye a block away and half a block to westminister bridge where you can walk across to big ben you can also catch all the tour buses there which for seeing london are a good bang for your pound ,1
 the room was so small and i upgraded to the newly refurbished room with an extra 35 and still no change the room was still a big disappointment was awake the whole night booked an airport pick up for 08h20 i almost missed my flight when the pick up was called in at 08h50 ,0
 it was really awful the rooms are horrible small not clean at all there is too much light in the room the heating doesn t work the shower was really dirty there is really really much noise it s impossible to sleep in the morning moreover it was really expensive i would never go back again and i advice everyone to find another place to stay there are really beter places in london ,0
 staff very friendly lovely decor comfortable bed everything you need ,1
 great breakfast,1
 the room was spotless and the bathroom was outstanding the bathroom had basics like shampoo conditioner but also had an emery nail board cotton buds cotton pads and more the view from room 1705 was breathtaking ,1
 maintenance in room next door noise all day when just come from a long haul flight ,0
 1 my room handed to me after 2 30 afternoon because i told the hotel my arrival time will be between 1 to 2 pm and i has been waiting around 40 minutes until my room get ready 2 no wifi because the signal was very weak 3 no fridge dirty carpet cover devote was to old and ripped 4 the bead too small for couples 5 its impossible to use the basin because its too close the toilet set 6 the kettle and tea cups kept inside the wardrobe ,0
 the bed was so comfy blackout curtains were great too fabulous nights sleep loved how there is a tunnel going straight from the o2 arena to the hotel after the concert straight in the hotel 30 seconds after concert had finished our bed had also been turned down curtains pulled and slippers out next to the bed the bose speaker in the bathroom linked to the tv was fabulous too will definitely be booking this hotel with every show we see at the o2 from now on great being able to go to the rooftop bar in the evening ,1
 great family room with all the facilities very comfertable and clean ,1
 being put in the basement rooms the noise from contractors or delivery people during the night was disturbing other reception staff lacked professionalism ,0
 excellent staff and a great location beautiful hotel lobby and unique architecture ,1
 all very good from view to check out,1
 pico room derute not cleaned no view ,0
 we booked a non smoking room but we were placed in the pro smoking floor they changed our room after we asked in addition smoke and weed smoke was passing through doors so consistently that we could not sleep we still do not understand why we could smell weed scent also in the non smoking room the bathrooms were also stinky as if they were not used much the moquette was dirty ,0
 the breakfast was burnt and it was served to me burnt an there was missing other stuff that was ment to accompany my breakfast and yet it was served to me without that being explained not only that my burger was over cooked and hard and burnt aswell ,0

 very confortable and quiet place to stay in london,1
 very high levels of service met at check in with a hot towel and a fruit drink and had my bags carried to my room super friendly and polite staff good value at 162 actually cheaper than the nearest premier inn that night ,1
 staff room prices of drinks,0
 the room was frozen i had to warm the bath with the hair dryer there s a gym room but without electricity nothing work,0
 no limited a c in common areas dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters musty smell throughout common areas deluxe rooms very small impractical design impractical shower design no place for soap poor quality bed mattress room refrigerator barely worked food in restaurant overprices only fair quality overall dark rundown dreary appearance,0
 the room was overpriced it is not really a 4 star hotel hair on the sheet and bathroom no kettle in the room i was charged 4 euros for coffee breakfast is 15 euros and you d expect proper breakfast for that price coffee is served by waiter expect to be judged if you want a refill staff is polite though is it not the least ,0
 every thing the front disk manager and some of the staff they have to change they are used the credit card without my permtion,0
 the location was perfect,1
 staff are not well trained and rude,0
 standard single room was not large but had every comfort and the bathroom was spacious and elegant the heating air conditioning was efficient and the atmosphere was peaceful,1
 beautiful room very polite and helpful staff ,1
 breakfast full and wholesome bed comfortable ,1
 we called for room service at 10 55 and no answer we spoke to reception who told us to the try again which we did but by now it was past 11pm and the night menu was only the available good stitch up we felt the room was tiny and tatty and had seen better days many moon ago the bathroom was so small grubby and the shower curtain was ripped the air con blew straight on to the bed the air volume control did not worth so i had too get up 3 times during the night to turn on and off we asked if this was a deluxe room as booked which apparently it was hate to think what the other rooms were like anyway if this is how booking com rate their hotels one needs to be more careful in the future ,0
 i asked for a quiet room and i only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular it was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice ,1
 the first room was like a postage stamp telephone did not work and only a small child could of got through the door of the shower from your information we were told it had a bar and restaurant when it only had a coffee shop ,0
 there was construction work going on outside my room it started at 7am it was extremely loud and uncomfortable i was not informed that construction work will be taking place the manager said this construction work will continue for another 8 months thus i would avoid staying at this hotel ,0
 as extensive travelers this was by far the best experience we have ever had as a family the jr suite was so comfortable with two kids in europe it is almost impossible to find comfort for a reasonable price they provided great wifi along with a complimentary cell phone to use while we were there the breakfast was hearty and delicious the staff was super courteous the rooms were modern and clean we could walk to hyde park in 15 minutes along with some great pubs within walking distance i cannot say enough great things ,1
 loved our comfy beds all staff were so great with my children very family friendly great food we really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back,1
 not good staff but great staff,1
 the bathroom was quite old and not as nice as the photographs the toilet is right next to door so inconvenient when going in and out of bathroom also there was not a fan in the bathroom also the shower was not powerful at all and the tv had poor signal also the local restaurants were all quite expensive ,0
 very expensive for a marginal location no comfortable common sitting lobby limited guest services during our visit to amsterdam we happened to find far better properties in more desirable neighborhoods for much less money ,0
 bed was too small and the property was loud this was the only property i used a debit card in and on return to the us someone in the uk area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash not recommended ,0

 fabulous bed and linen the haymarket is the cleanest hotel i have stayed in staff are lovely decor exuberant and fun the breakfast is very good indeed for such a central location it feels very tranquil ,1

 stuff not overly friendly stressed out bed uncomfortable bid worn out lobby cooled down to the minimum ,0
 the proximity to the o2 arena the quality of the facilities and the food the impeccable service ,1

 no help with luggage one bathrobe missing insufficient bathroom shampoo for two air con awful slept in a room far to hot and air con did not work and yes i did follow the instructions we didn t call for help as we were far to tired and didn t want to have to wait for assistance and after the service at the concierge we didn t think the hotel could be bothered the room was supposed to be a deluxe which was supposed to include a seating area unless this meant the desk chair there was none i was suspicious this was not a deluxe room i have stayed in american chain hotels before never again in a hilton ,0
 the staff were uniformly excellent especially the spanish cook at breakfast who took such a pride in his work and quality of service ,1
 i thought the breakfast was a bit overpriced for what i had,0

 missing bulbs on the hall way toilets in the gym and swimming pool not clean although you paid for the room you still pay for swimming which water wasn t the cleanest parking not safe and not clear indication,0
 staff is friendly they accept my late checkout they arrange my airport transport breakfast is yummy internet speed is good,1
 the rooms are completely worn out it is dirty it smells in my room none of the lights were working only the lamp on the ceiling it took 40 minutes before a technician came and this was just an older reception man with no idea how to solve the problem so no suggestion to give me another room i had to work without light the badroom floor is broke the sink was painted to hide all the damages and at the reception there are some people who hate customers i have to tell also that i saw a young woman who was very friendly to the customers and really dis her best but both employees who helped me ware blunt even rude both my colleague and i were often surprised about the attitude of this receptionist i will never go back to this hotel,0
 sumptuous surroundings and friendly staff ,1

 the rooms are spacious with the beds being extra comfortable and the location of the hotel is great with the o2 just being right next door the indoor pool is brilliant the hotel itself is amazing the staff here are very helpful and i will definitely look into staying here again ,1
 refusal by staff to check me in till paying 100 in cash deposit didn t accept credit card payment power shut for over an hour no apology given,0
 comfortable bed nice bathroom excellent breakfast and nice seating area,1
 the staff are unfriendly and the location is bad ,0
 size of single room no aircon window did not open not very clean breakfast very poor and staff at breakfast unfriendly and not helpful,0
 the complimentary tea biscuits in my room were half eaten the walls and ceiling in the room so thin that my room and bed shook when the person above me walked across his her room and the staff refused to even check and see if another room were available for the other nights i had booked with them moreover on the hottest september in london on record they turned off the air conditioning controls in my room upon writing a detailed letter of complaint to the manager weeks later i have still not received any reply ,0
 the bed was excellent and the breakfast was too ,1
 decent location,1
 location was good room quite spacious ,1
 we were transferred from executive suites as the boiler was broken and there was no hot water placed in a tiny basement room there was water pouring the the ceiling light fitting inside the shower the restaurant was chaos staff not trained service terrible management had very little idea about organising staffing and customer service ,0
 the bathroom was quite big location was very convenient,1
 the hotel is under refurbishment and should be charged accordingly this was an expensive weekend in an hotel which is not up to standard at present ,0
 the photo s shown on booking com were nothing like the room we had tiny room worn carpet cracked mirror in bathroom dirty sink area and miserable staff not happy ,0
 the friendliness of the staff was exceptional they wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was 6 months pregnant received special treatment breakfast was very good ,1
 the staff were very rude there customer service skills were shocking the food was disgusting the value for money was very poor the rooms were far to cramped the lift was out of service more than once not ideal for somebody with a physical condition mainly the paying system was rubbish your staff told me and my partner we could pay as we were leaving on the sunday i went to pay and they informed me i had already payed through booking com the account the money was taken from was not mine it was my daughters this wasn t acceptable you need to up your staff training and take a serious look at your facilities and how your staff treat your customers ,0
 good location big rooms,1
 smoking room was not available,0
 the least value for money hotel i ve ever stayed in i paid 198 for a small single room that was like a cell ,0
 bed was really comfortable ,1
 no activities for kids hence not family friendly no lounge to chill and relax,0
 nothing,0
 the room nice but in the basement,0
 beautiful room great view ,1
 beds were very uncomfortable kettle didn t work and we had to ask twice to get it fixed paper cups instead of mugs bad value for money ,0
 at the time of booking via booking com i was particularly attracted by 5 rating you have there and hence i was eager to pay a premium given that this was going to be a very special night for me and my wife after a very long and difficult period when i had to be in hospital upon arrival we were greeted professionally and though we had to queue for reception i found the member of staff working well however we were quite disappointed when we went up to the room where we did not find essentials like toothbrushes or toothpaste which would be a norm even in a 3 hotel later on we realised there was only an empty box of tissues we wanted to use internet on tv but the keyboard did not work we reported it to the reception and it took a member of staff over half an hour to come to us and change batteries by which time we did not need the keyboard later it happened that the bondage i have on my neck leaked and we asked for a firs aid kit plasters and cotton pads these were brought to us 15min later no scissors which we asked to bring and they cam another half an hour later and we were asked to return half empty asda plaster pack when we finished this again did not look particularly 5 to me we asked for a large bottle of water paid and were said that you don t serve water in large bottles i appreciate you are trying to do your best for environment and that s what appeals to my wife and me too but we could not quite understand why the duvet cover had holes in it and gowns were 50 polyester with belts not matching on the final note the water temperature in shower was very difficult to regulate it was piping hot and cold and you could not predict how it would change next minute so there was a chance of burn ps this feedback was sent to the hotel management with no response received from them ,0
 when i stayed before the rooms seemed adequate in size this time round the room was smaller than most bathrooms extremely claustrophobic i was glad to leave another night would have challenged my sanity ,0
 too small dangerous shower too expensive,0
 all staff very helpful,1
 had to move rooms the place was so cold sorry but i wont be staying there again,0
 location for the hammersmith apollo friendly staff especially christian maurice in the bar being upgraded for being customer off the day,1
 the room i was given is the corner room in lower ground floor it wasn t sound proof at all i could hear people e g cleaning staff etc talking outside and tapping their foot i called the reception to change my room but they assured me to ask people not to talk i front of room but you can t stop people walking the wifi was very very weak and also i couldn t use my phone 4g due to lower ground floor i have e planned everything next morning up the manager but not a good outcome i will not recommend anyone to go there ,0
 nice safe location great local amenities and useful having having two tubes and bikes to get through the parks good shower,1
 the should really be sued for having 4 stars typical shaftesbury budgety chain cheap and small run down extremely small rooms cold rooms that cant keep heating due to the ac there is only a very old ac not a healthy way of heating up in both rooms i was which is controlled by them to change for the warmness so you have to call them up every time maids do not do a good job of cleaning and ignore change the sheets notes and will not change them it is unacceptable to have to see the salt water stains in the shower have a 3 year build up they also make noises early in the mornings chatting and gossiping even the indian porter is noisey very hard bed and pillows no fridge which is unacceptable for this day and age dirty old furniture they have a 1x1 fitness room with only one elliptical machine unbelievable that this hotel exists even the elevator is very slow and takes ages not all rooms are accecible by elevator i cant find anything positive apart from the location an absolute rip off the hotel and hospitality association should go and inspect room 114 and the fitness room it seems like this hotel is is run and managed by very stingy people who wont spend a penny on it you can tell that from the white goods quality and the toilet paper it needs a total revamp and 2 3 million thrown in it i wasnt in basement rooms but i can imagine what their basement floor would be like this is a barely 2 stars hotel with some club rooms ,0
 room was clean and tidy with lots of room and a comfortable bed ,1
 staff reception guys are good tis you have to deal with them in reception but if you ask anything to be fixed in room like air con etc there attitude is rude as customers are not watching them there room service i asked in morning for room service and they didn t provided new towels no new soaps or shampoo cleaning was not up to any standard rooms size i was not expecting this tiny size double room that in night is you walk to toilet you will literally hit the tele its very small room extremely small for this price of room such type of room is just not right and in central london why i just don t get pillows on bed are so massive thats its good for hulk not humans restless night due to pillows in shower a tall person cannot take shower as they have a rack there which will hit your head plenty times parking is too expensive i paid 44 per day but they have listed this not something new air conditioning is very low i asked to get it fixed and they said this is the max it was suffocating i will not be living here again its better i try hyatt or marriot as if booked early i could get near to there rate of 179 guys try any other but not radisson blue i seriously recommend this way to type more so no one gets restless ,0
 not good,0
 1st room was small dirty walls paint peeling and windows that didn t open we got moved after complaining to an alternative room junior suite this was a smoking room neither of us smoke but limited availability the whole hotel is dark and very tired with threadbare carpets a lot of money for a poor hotel ,0
 i arrived early in the morning after a long trip from africa i was able to take a shower and change clothes in the wellness centre which made the day fo me perfect for 2 nights in transit between a long journey from africa and a really long journey to nz quiet yet less than 5 minute walk to piccadilly line at earl s court even dragging heavy suitcase ,1
 reception staff were unfriendly one was extremely un cooperative about check out procedures room was shabby and the tea coffee provision was very poor toiletries also poor overpriced for what was provided and has definitely gone downhill since i first stayed there several years ago ,0
 room is way smaller than on the photo and it s not a value for money,0
 we are on holiday out all day exhausted from sight seeing back to hotel not been cleaned no tea or coffee to make a drink toiletries non existent because no one cleaned the room for three days until my husband went down to foyer and asked nicely for it to be done will not stay here again in total we had eleven days stay beginning of june and from the 23 rd 29 th,0
 room clean and beds made every day a fantastic breakfast lots of options hot and cold loved the scrambled eggs all staff are very friendly and polite will stay again ,1
 courtyard out the back which takes you away from the main streets lovely place to sit for drinks staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were lovely,1
 could not fault the staff or the hotel from start to finish staff couldn t have been more helpful or friendly the room was amazing very spacious spotless and so comfortable the hotel is in a great location literally round the corner from russell square station i would definitely stay here again and have been recommending it to everyone ,1
 the staff hotel manager were so helful friendly which made a huge difference to our stay ,1
 fantastic location got a deal on room rate so made stay value for money would recommend as right next to shops and tube station walking distance from euston ,1
 great hotel upgraded as guestvof thecday which was much appreciated ,1
 well designed room considering quite small though it was not smallest room ,1
 the location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the underground tube we also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district there were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice the staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly they also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them ,1
 fantastic all round great location superb facilities brilliant staff,1
 no heating in room went from one room to another settled on third room no one could speak english all staff saying no understand ,0
 lovely big room airconditioning actually worked and cooled the room,1
 the rooms are very good food 10 10 staff 10 10 ,1
 this dark basement room was literally the size of the double bed see photos and is the smallest i have stayed in that s saying something as hotel rooms are usually small in the city there was no window only one power socket no wardrobe or place to store clothes or bag luckily i was alone as it was a business trip i can t imagine having two people in that room music played in the corridor outside my room all night they provide earplugs which don t really help i hardly slept as it felt really claustrophobic and was noisy i was notified of no window on booking but had little choice as i was stranded due to storm doris never again ,0
 the table in our room haf crumbs on it the door to our first room wouldnt open the cleans walked in without knocking even tho we asked for late check out,0
 the rooms were not up to standard very small and dull after upgrading at a pricy cost they were average i was promised access to the executive lounge and was not allowed in and the staff member was rude the plates at breakfast were dirty overall a bad experience and will not recommend to anyone else ,0
 nice clean rooms and space with a kettle bottled water and hot drinks restocked daily nice en suite bathrooms with a great shower very friendly helpful and polite multilingual staff very chic lobby and outdoor areas great breakfast buffet food an electronic safe and mini fridge were provided in each room good location walking distance to bercy village and cour st milion metro ,1
 the hotel is very beautiful it has an amazing antique reception and hall the entire experience was great the staff was very helpful the hotel manager was very welcoming on the day we arrived as he wrote a special note welcoming us i loved that personal touch yes central london is very expensive and the rooms aren t big but it s central london and when everything that one can possibly need is available without asking then nothing else matters the toilet even had a bath tub which was great a great experience and its just on the other side of the queensway station a 2 min walk and has many restaurants and supermarkets in the vicinity which is an added advantage totally worth it i recommend it strongly ,1
 within walking distance of nearest underground station hammersmith each connecting to centre of the city and to heathrow all terminals,1
 staff,0
 most things were more than excellent especially the staff who were brilliant ,1
 friendly staff good selection at breakfast a nice surprise in our room due to a celebration ,1

 spacious room for central london beautiful building close to euston station and roti king,1
 the bathroom was not clean hair on the toilet and a dirty shower are the welcome we have received the bed had a very old spring mattress and in the room there was a creepy mirror wall covered by a shade is this supposed to be a four stars hotel the hotel had no breakfast area all they do is providing the customers with a lame breakfast box in the room at a specific time some cold stuff in it and a coffee or so and don t try to call the reception if you are in need to anticipate it because the answer is no apparently they are doing renovations so the breakfast area is not available for who knows how long but they don t tell you this detail until you get to the reception to check in so much for the continental breakfast included this is my last stay in a best western ,0
 old edwardian charm and location the dining room and other public spaces were done by the interior designer of the rms titanic and the dining room is an almost exact copy ,1
 the responses of the staff,1
 great location,1
 the rooms were too small and breakfast very poor you have to pay extra 5 pounds to eat common egg one very old lift that does not even go to all floors the property should not be rated ,0
 great location equidistant from the various must see sights in london ,1
 the hotel is poor in every aspect the last redecoration overhaul is over 25 years ago wifi has the poorest performance imaginable worst croissants in my life,0
 close to eventim clean comfortable ,1
 the smell fragrance when you walked in every day was awful the lifts were not all working and were being worked on and slow the room was tiny and the construction scaffolding banging outside my room off putting the food in the restaurant was the worste we had in all of the uk and no ice makers on any floor but the first w broken lifts made ice hard to get each day charging for the ice and having a machine that only would take old coins non of which i had made it impossible to get any ,0
 bed was really comfortable ,1
 all of it ,0
 i was given a room in basement with no window and fresh paint smell so strong it made me feel ill i asked to move and only rooms also had no window and even smaller but no paint smell so had to accept the staff person in charge at the time was horrible but the assistant and cleaner who replaced the remote that didn t work were very nice and tried to do their best for me overall a very claustrophobic and upsetting experience though music in bar too loud one beer cost me 6 and hotel very over heated in my windowless room i was using air conditioning all night so stupid ,0
 good food clean facility,1
 there is no variety on the breakfast and the rooms very small,0
"good, i like it and i love the view out the windouw",1
 we were awoken by someone opening the door to our room at 01 15 in the morning as i was then awake i went to reception at 01 30 to enquire what was going on to be told that the night porter had assumed our room was unoccupied and allocated a key card to a couple checking in at 1am in the morning we received no apology nor appreciation of our concern for this breach in security from neither the night porter nor the duty manager when we once again reported this incident the following morning the safe in our room was also not functioning we would suggest to future guests to take care with security when using this hotel in future ,0
 the smallest room and bed i have ever stayed in i tried to request a change but the internet was down and they d get back to me which never happened ,0
 the location and the ease of service,1
 the friendly staff breakfast and afternoon tea were excellent very attentive without making you feel uncomfortable ,1
 decor tired toilet flush didn t work staff generally snotty and uninterested no free wifi anywhere in the hotel but thankfully plenty of places nearby to eat and drink with complimentary wifi,0
 location,1
 double bed was just 2 singles pushed together parking was 21 for the night wifi was not free,0
 we had a fantastic stay staff were amazing room well equipped with comfy beds,1
 worst hotel experience in my life first of all they ask you for a 50 pound deposit for damages and they don t have a mini bar the staff worst staff i ve had to deal with except for one tall dark bell boy at the front desk talks to the guests in a patronizing way got upgraded to a room number 007 the noisiest room i ve ever stayed in on the ground floor and next to the kitchen so you hear everything on the street even if someone is just walking and you hear them preparing breakfast from i don t know when the room has 10 flight of stairs that lead to the bathroom so if you have to go to the bathroom you go to an upper floor imagine doing that in the middle of the night i d rather sleep finally you have to leave your room key when you leave ,0
 charge me 20 extra for nothing,0
 sink in the bathroom was quite old and you can clearly see that it s been overused carpets are not the nicest noise from outside can be heard inside even though the window was closed ,0
 position cleanliness rooms are newly renovated quite soft beds,1
 fire alarm went off at 2am due to dripping water poor maintenance all guests needed to evacuate in the morning there was no apology or any offer of compensation for a broken nights sleep a bond of 50 is held for a month after checkout far too long ,0
 it is not up to the standard,0
 locality helpful staff nice breakfast,1
 staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 i was having a very different opinion about sofitel but this one was not even close to that most of the experiences were negative a restaurant staff were very rude and they do not know how to treat the customers b breakfast options not good very limited and routine c not much option for lunch and dinner d in house restaurant didn t even had veggies for preparing a salad for a dinner e at 10 30 nothing except a soup was available for dinner in an in house restaurant then hows it a 24 hour restaurant f doorman staff were not that friendly ,0

 the room was very cosy the decoration and architecture contributed a lot the staff was warm while performing its duty we felt in a confortable cocoon with no icy and superficial luxury it was de bon aloi ,1
 helpful and efficient staff very good location particularly once you have found the best exit from the metro many restaurants and bars nearby would especially recommend pizzeria mimmo at 14 rue saint dennis wifi worked well,1
 the location was superb and the staff friendly and helpful there are improvements currently underway but it had little impact we had a with no view and noise from the air conditioning but that was probably a reflection on the price we paid ,1

 my room was tatty the hotel reception smelt like urine was very run down we stay at the plaza westminster bridge and thought if it was same company it would be similar but complete opposite ,0
 the hotel blocked the due amount twice first they blocked part of it to secure payment on the day of the payment they additionally blocked the rest of the due payment no reason no warning no info from booking or the hotel had huge troubles because of it so so unprofessional besides small rooms the first room i got had a gorgeous wall view and too short bed the other had better view though broken bad breakfasts boring and few options only ,0
 traffic ruined my sleep that us the number one necessity of booking a hotel room the hotel staff knew that the window is not double glazed and yet i was put into the room the breakfast was like a factory production line i shall not book the hotel again ,0
 the room was extremely small no turn down the room looked like it had been prepared in 2 mins no care with the bedding and the towels very poor no bottled water in the room the tv didn t work upon arrival the maintenance guy had to reboot the system no a good experience ,0

 amazing hotel with great friendly staff that go out there way to help ,1
 hotel was excellent the amenities and location couldnt have been better the lobby bar and staff were superb nothing was too much trouble ,1
 the double room was so small there was no room to store bags two people were unable to dress at the same time the walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided the gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating ,0
 we were upgraded to the penthouse suit ,1
 very convenient location for earl s court tube station warm welcome from reception staff good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon ,1
 the location was perfect right outside the rer and metro walking distance from the arc de triomphe and the air france shuttle bus the hotel staff found out that we were on honeymoon and upgraded our room throughout the stay they were very helpful helped us print tickets quick to bring up requests like towels pillows and glasses and gave directions and suggestions for tourist to do s in paris the rooms are a bit small but it s an average size for european hotel rooms they also look exactly the same as the pictures advertised on the site overall a great place to stay in paris highly recommend it ,1

 good breakfast,1
 rude staff when we arrived charging of 150 euros on top of the 480 already paid for security and at the end paying another 15 euro for tax such a daily rate and not including breakfast or at least some coffee the bed was really two single beds put together king room only in name ,0
 didn t get room booked had to stay in a family room which is in a poor state of repair the mirror in the bathroom slides open to reveal the gap between rooms you could talk to your neighbour in the next door bathroom creepy someone could gain access to your room via the mirror it is not secured ,0
 the room was amazing,1
 excellent staff very helpful we went to london to celebrate my husbands birthday and the extra touches in the room helped to make it a special time,1

 i expected a budget room to be small but this really was v small cramped not enough space for suitcase shower area adequate hidden wardrobe drop down desk useful bed however very comfortable indeed staff exceptionally helpful which made up for the minute sized room ,1
 ornate hotel with lovely external appearance refurbished new room top floor central location,1
 1 i booked pay later through booking com but had half the money of my booking taken from my account a week before the stay and was released to me on the day of my stay 2 on arrival they took the full amount plus 50pound per night that we d get back after the stay 3 order a double room and got two single beds pushed together with different duvets 4 on checkout they then tried to charge us for room service we hadn t ordered and then tried to charge us the hotel amount again and it wasn t until we spoke to a manager that we was told the money we gave on check out was just being held so not really sure why they needed to hold money a week before we came then hold the money for the hotel plus an extra 50 per night seemed a bit odd to me just lucky we had an extra 100 pounds that we didn t need that weekend and the money for them to hold a week before arrival all in all the room and the way the hotel works is rubbish just lucky they have a good location otherwise i m not sure people would stay here ,0

 service some of the worst ever experienced air conditioning broken,0
 on site restaurants awful,0
 everything it was dark dirty and depressing ,0

 its proximity to key sites was excellent ,1
 the girl was on the phone arguing with god knows who about some luggage which was not put in the correct room as the guest felt unwell and she didnt write her handover correctly infact i could tell you everything about that event some things should be spoken about in private left us waiting for ages till we could check in she kept telling the person on the phone she has guests waiting to check in but they took no notice very very very poor staff levels at this property check in was terrible,0
 being awaken by the fire alarm at 6 30 am due to a mistake of the staff noisy road works from 7 am carpet quite old and dirty room extremely small price prohibitive for such a poor performance ,0
 room size and facilities in roman and hotel,1

 location was excellent close to the undrground easy walking to shopping district great bar and snack facilities staff excellent ,1
 all the staff were wonderful polite and friendly ,1
 location,1
 the staff were appalling and rude the evening manager actually swore at myself and friend when we asked for a glass of water i have never experienced such poor service bad language and no apology the next day by the general manager we were actually made to feel like we were making up the complaint disgusted would not return or recommend it to anyone customer service is so good now in hotels i think this hotel does not know the meaning of looking after their customers properly or dealing with complaints,0
 the service was faultless ,1
 great day staffs but the ones in the evening were really rude heating on the first floor wasn t working or they switched off arrived in the room and it was a twin bed asked them to make it a double bed they were rude and when they came to the room to do it they put the two singles duvets inside the a double cover duvet it can imagine how good it was ,0
 the staff and the manager are lacking adequate customer care the facilities in the room were dated likewise the decorations the toilet seat was broken on checking in the room and after been reported to the reception was told to come down from 10th floor to the reception to collect new magnetic door card for another room only by citing lack of customers due care that the reception changes the decision to send someone to bring the new card and show us the new room having to carried our luggages without offering assistance the second room too has a poor t v reception and only to report that once again and to be told that it will take almost 25minutes for someone to come and resolve the issue it was a real nightmare and poor value for money despite the upgrade the breakfast was very dried up especially the fried eggs bacon and sausages the breakfast restaurant also dated and opened floor panels showing rotten floor boards with different patches on the carpets the hotel used to be our family xmas dinner and last attended about 10years ago and seeing the same floor carpets layouts and decorations still remained the same not to talk about the underground car park unkept ,0
 booked holiday inn on a famous street i wasn t expecting luxury but a decent accommodation and service standards after check in was shocked to enter a dingy room with no regular height windows room size not bigger than a single bed it was claustrophobic no water bottles with tea and coffee highly disappointed ,0
 the buffet breakfast was excellent we went half an hour before it finished but you d never know everything was still available and very fresh ,1
 rooms were very small ,0
 staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service breakfast buffet is first rate easy access to rest of london esp old brompton road and knotting hill ,1
 very small room and bathroom i could almost not get into the shower breakfast is below the level of a 4 star hotel the service entrance atmosphere has nothing to do with a 4 star hotel ,0
 great location very nice rooms and kinf staff ,1
 beautiful building packed with original features but with all the usual modern facilities perfectly located around the corner from the tube station ,1
 great location just outside main london but still a tube and busses nearby the breakfest was good with enough choice for everybody and the staff was nice and helpfull there was enough space in our room and the bathroom had everything you need i recommend this hotel to my friends and family for their next london trip ,1
 the breakfasts were delicious the beds very comfy and we enjoyed the extras that came with our club room the staff was very welcoming and helpful ,1
 location and quality of rooms,1
 the room was unclean i booked a double room but was apparently upgraded to a suite which had 2 single beds pushed together the room temperature would not drop below 26 degrees no water in the room which i find in this day and age and at the cost we paid was unacceptable the room was in need of a refurbishment the shower was either red hot or freezing cold the windows in the downstairs bar were absolutely filthy the air con also didn t work anywhere on the ground floor the furniture in the downstairs bar and foyer area need replacing as it had pieces of tape holding splits in the leather together the staff behind reception were grumpy and were not helpful at all the staff in breakfast were all young children and were lacking leadership and needed to be motivated there were many tables uncleaned with the previous persons plates still sat there the presentation of the food looked rushed and was chucked in dishes to try and keep up with the masses of people queuing to get into breakfast i actually went in for breakfast early prior to going for a meeting and was waiting so long i had to leave as i would have been late for my meeting the staff in the bar were actually very nice and did there best for us ,0
 the day time receptionist lady rude and prepotent no desire to help hotel customers,0
 room was beautiful it looked out to the square with the fountains it also had a coffee machine,1
 too expensive for what is offered,0
 staff were very helpful they took time to explain the tube systems and how was best to get to places ,1
 room was like in a basement with no windows so no natural light for an executive double i d have expected more staying against next week 24 5 so hoping i get a better room ,0
 the tv in my room was broken then when fixed i had all the sports channel bar one that was listed but just had a blue screen that i requested to watch and was told it was unavailable and that i should perhaps go out to see it ,0
 loved the location staff were excellent proffessioal yet very friendly would especially like to thank anna at reception for organising a little something special for my husbands 40th made our weekend thank you ,1
 bed,0
 the room was very clean,1
 situation of hotel staff were very friendly and informative we up graded to a deluxe room slightly disappointed as the room was small would have liked to have seen a standard room ,1
 friendly staff welcome drink location overall cleanliness and comfort,1
 staff are very kind location of the hotel is very good,1
 noisy room some kind of tumble dryer going until 11pm anytime anyone in the hotel ran a tap you could hear it informed staff all they did was laugh i wouldn t stay here was his response avoid this place at all costs,0
 the rooms were old and tired as was most of the hotel they were very very small and the air con unit didn t work the hotel was very dated with carpets that looked like they had been there since henry 8th last visited i honestly can t understand why this hotel is classed as a 4 star as the swimming pool must be tidal with the tide mark that surrounded the pool that come off when rubbed with your finger i ve had warmer ice creams than the what the sauna was i didn t feel at all safe in the lift and expected at any given minute to plummet to my death with the rickety old bone shaker of a lift they have better lift facilities going into a mine shaft this is literally one of the worst hotels i ve stayed in and travelling to london on a regular basis from now on i ll stay in a travel lodge very poor all round ,0
 rooms are badly in need of updating clipped paint and pealing wallpaper also the neighborhood is a bit run down,0
 the hotel was outdated double bed was two singles bed pushed together very uncomfortable room not too clean dust and flies not much selection on room service menu ,0
 cooked breakfast,0
 everything is near to the hotel ,1
 location and staff,1
 they charge me for the mini bar but they didn t tell me at all i need to pay for it is absurd i hate it i will never go back there at plaza hotel,0
 the stunning architecture and the politeness of the staff ,1

 great location friendly and helpful staff ,1
 location,1

 i loved the location and the helpful staff ,1
 loved the view clean and comfortable rooms bedroom was quite small for the price i paid however i do believe this is normal for paris ,1
 comfortable room nice staff,1
 the pictures on the booking com is totally misleading the room is very old way too small only fit a double bed n nothing else i bet u in if u are 200lbs u cannot fit in the bedroom ,0
 had issues with the checking in took over an hour to resolve with bloomsbury denying my reservation despite me having email proof from booking com and then asking to just purchase another room to deal with it in the morning as this was getting very late into the night with work the next morning seemed very reserved to assist and then booking com finally answered the phone to refuse any form of compensation booking com blaming the bloomsbury palace and the bloomsbury palace blaming booking com overall did not feel like a guest in the hotel and more a nuisance ,0
 the location and comfort of this hotel was first class as you would expect for london and this area it is not the cheapest but the studio room and views were first class we used the restaurants in the hotel and the food was excellent though expensive but again for london it was fine children are well catered for and the staff very helpful will return again ,1
 tired old hotel with very small rooms poor public areas needs a big refurb asap ,0

 incompetent reception staff weird system that consists of locking the fridge unless you pay 100 extra on guarantee is the visa card not a guarantee i woke up in the middle of the night thirsty and because the receptionist didn t explain their internal pathetic rule of locking fridges l ended up drinking the tap water ,0
 felt totally welcome with our younger kids all staff interactions were really pleasant the adjoining rooms were perfect and for paris we had plenty of room and a huge closet to get our stuff put away restaurants super close by so if kids are babysitting age parents can go across the street for a nice dinner ,1
 everything this hotel should not be ranked as a 4star in the uk this wouldn t be ranked more than a 2 the bedrooms stank of smoke or chemicals covering up smoke we changed rooms 3 times before we could bare the smell level the beds were tiny the staff rude and unhelpful ,0
 rooms were small old and tacky toilets seemed dirty as they were so stained room was on 21st floor so the smell of fish coming from the restaurant on the 23rd floor was unbearable bed was squeaky matress cover was stained and the whole ambience of the room was dark and old ,0
 very small room in the basement room smelt musty no room service need to walk down the street to another building for check in and breakfast,0
 good breakfast ,1
 all,0
 we had booked an extra bed that was not in the room on arrival we arrived at 23 and had to wait until midnight with children to get bed organised cleaning equipment dusters cloths etc was lying around the room on arrival only towels for 2 people although booked for 3 and on cleaning the following am only 2 towels were given despite 3 beds in the room hotel is worn and dated in urgent need of refurbishment staff pleasant but came across inexperienced and needing support staff training ,0
 not so clean rooms we had aunts in the room not so clean bathroom very small space for bathroom separated from the shower and bathtub no ventilation very user furniture the so called free wifi is not working in the room only at the reception ,0
 room was noisy kettle was full of soap spils all over the walls and 50 for a bottle of standard wine,0
 tiny bathroom not the greatest shower the air conditioning fan would not turn off at night ,0

 location,1
 very noisy and very small rooms,0
 breakfast was good,1
 the beds were great the concierge was perfect the breakfast copious our stay was worth every pound nicely located quiet inside our room and wonderful in every way ,1
 we were disappointed with the executive suite very small window opened out on to the service yard not at all executive the room service was very poor it took three attempts to get the basics of a very simple order any where near correct we ordered a afternoon tea which was supposed to consist of a selection of sandwiches and cakes along with cream scones and strawberry preserve we got two scones and cream no preserve no knifes no milk when eventually preserve was brought it was marmalade at which stage we just gave up there was a lot of noise throughout the night people running up and down the corridor and slamming doors ,0
 great location,1
 the staff was unpleasant i got the worst room in the hotel on the first floor at the end of the hall right next to the service room also the room had a view on huge works it looked like i was sleeping in the works being done the condition and the cleanliness of the room were very poor i asked at the reception to change rooms i was moved to a slighltly better room but again the room looked very old and not clean the room was very noisy at night because of the overground there was even a smell of cigarettes although it was a non smoking room also the heater in my room was not working the air conditionning was put at 25 degrees as i was cold at night i called reception and they sent me a heater of course the heater was in very poor condition and no one noticed that the plug was completly burned i had to call reception again to get another heater the maintenance of the hotel is very bad the conditions of the rooms as well it is a shame that this hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel it should have at mosttt 3 stars i hope i will never have to sleep in this hotel again ,0
 wifi at the lobby only too much noise early morning from the bars near the hotel because the window is not sound proof,0
 small room ,0
 i lost my laptop charger i don t know if i left it at the room or some one stolen it was a surface charger ,0
 staff size of room and cleanliness of it grand old hotel,1
 too many people at breakfast and picking at the food ,1
 great room lovely staff who welcomed my two boys and have them vouchers for icecream at the bar which was a really lovely gesture for us great products for the bathroom felt very relaxed best value for money in london ,1
 excellent breakfast but dungeon of a breakfast room plenty of choice with far brighter ambiance outside hotel ,1
 the whole place is run down,0
 i thought the rooms would be bigger as i reserved a room for three people but the room was too small for 3 people reception very slow elevators are a mess carpet in the rooms are not very clean the shower in our room leaked water all over the floor also the tv didn t work the entire time we were there i reserved a room for 3 people but they only offer towels for 2 pity as i used to like staying at the previous nikko hotel ,0
 location is perfect,1
 poor rooms for a deluxe king room at 150 a night these rooms were a disgrace ive stayed in better travel lodges at a fifth of the price the room was dirty had chips missing from the walls and skirting boards mould was growing on the windows and in the bathroom a delightful adjoining door as thick as a piece of paper meant we were awake at 5 30am when our neighbours were leaving then awoken again at 8 30am when the cleaning team came to dismantle the room with sledgehammers or so it sounded a full blown argument between 3 members of staff which we heard every word of regarding the facilities we had a hairdryer that exploded and a tv that wasnt tuned to anything and had no signal a waste of time basically ,0
 excellent location superb historic building very nice and helpful staff one of my favourite hotels in london ,1
 it is expensive so you have to rate the location highly in order to regard it as good value for money ,0
 adjacent building loud jack hammer and drilling construction noises and difficult to access property by taxi very non private garden patio from upper floor guest and office buildings workers just above floor 3 ,0
 staff unfriendly small rooms noisy ,0
 it was very old and dirty needs renovation the coplete cost of the trip was requested to be drawn on the first day no mini fridge no case to lock important belongings such as passport ,0
 didn t like anything breakfast was cold every morning staff were unfriendly the room was booked for 2 people but only shampoo and shower wash for 1 person 5 star hotel and no tea bags or complimentary biscuits bath towels were hard and had a hole in i m not sure how this hotel was awarded 5 stars ,0
 excellent facilities clean rooms brilliant location friendly and helpful staff great breakfast choice and quality very good value for money ,1
 generally tired decor and dirty no hot water and had to move rooms at midnight offered us 9 discount for the inconvenience breakfast was poor cheap sausages powdered egg ,0
 the facade is spectacular and the location couldn t be better for sight seeing and shopping in london staff extremely friendly and helpful ,1
 old building with poor maintenance elevator super small sofa bed is nod bed just sofa ok for a child no for a teenager or adult check in and check out a nightmare we didn t get the room we paid for no worries to try to solve the problem at all traveling with children the guy at the reception pretend to fit everyone in a king size bed during the check out we were asked if we had used the mini bar and even when we said no we were charged with mini bar again no worries to verify the mistake when finally decided to check and confirm the mistake no chance we can get the money back for being a weekend ,0
 expensive for the type of accomodation reused blankets not properly cleaned,0
 the hotel is in the middle of refurbishment which is not mentioned no bar lift out of order entrance via back door no contact from management despite complaints at the time a shame as i stayed ten times in 2015 but never again ,0
 the hotel overall could use a make over i paid 199 and got one of the smallest rooms in the hotel ,0
 clean rooms and a comfy bed staff very helpful and friendly ideal location ,1
 the staff were extremely helpful and engaging the bedroom was extremely well equipped iron hair drier kettle which made it extremely easy for us to prepare for our evenings out on the town and well as enjoy tea coffee and cakes during our stay oh and the view was amazing we had a corner view looking over the park ,1
 superb hotel staff were very friendly and professional the bed was fantastic great location for central paris and the main sites ,1
 room service,1
 the hotel was just fabulous in every respect but it was the staff who really made it different from other similar starred properties in london i was given a mini tour on arrival and a potted history of the building before being shown to my small but beautifully decorated room and given a welcome drink the area was so quiet and the bed extremely comfortable i opted for the healthy option at breakfast which was delicious and everyone i met made me feel extremely special i only stayed for one night but received lots of little gifts in that time i would certainly stay again yes it was an expensive treat but makes a special occasion extra special and worth every penny ,1
 the room was clearly not a room it was a lobby to the garden where they put a bed 80x170cm which obviously was a sofa and not a bed located on one of the landing in the staircase the room was noisy and not comfy at all the bathroom was a cupboard where i could barely stand i travel a lot for business and that room was far way the worst i ve ever had ,0
 the hotel itself was confusing it was apartments and a hotel which wasn t stated when booking and when i arrived it looked a mess from the outside as the apartments at the top looked like it was a dumping ground for furniture there was no clear entrance for parking or the hotel and we were greeted by a woman who was anything but warm after a couple of minutes she became helpful however never cracked a smile or made us feel welcome the bathroom had hair all in the shower which made us not want to use it our room was nice clean and spacious but our view was tainted by it literally being face to face with the gym window so i had to be careful when walking around getting changed as people on the tredmills could see me very clearly the whole reason i booked the hotel was because of the spa facilities however the hydropool was out of use which we weren t told and so we cancelled our bookings because we wanted to relax in the pool and we re disappointed we weren t told until check in as this would of changed my mind on the hotel we ordered breakfast room service and ordered tea even though it was free in our room because we wanted larger mugs when it arrived we had no cutlery no cups no spoons no toast so i called downstairs to tell reception which took 3 calls because no one answered and they gave me attitude because i asked for cups and cutlery after 15 minutes we received our cutlery and toast etc however the man delivering it really didn t believe me and came into the room without me allowing him even though i was not dressed comfortably for this on check out i had to pay for the breakfast and the tea and it was not worth the money for the hassle i felt stressed leaving which i shouldn t have ,0
 good breakfast and the decor of the hotel is wonderful,1
 the staff were like robots no expression what s so ever room was terrible could really do with a more up to date look really back dated decore the bed was so uncomfortable didn t help my back i really wouldn t recomend this hotel to any body ramada in the dock lands much cleaner more modem with great staff and views plus free parking ,0
 wide selection at breakfast junior suite was spacious ,1
 really comfie bed lovely thick towels slippers supplied,1
 lovely clean hotel in a great location staff were very friendly and helpful and keen to ensure we had the best possible stay the room was immaculate and well equipped ,1
 bad value for the money broken a c bad wi fi connection and very limited choices for a very expensive breakfast ,0
 no internet are you kidding i should have had a refund for my enormous roaming charges to try and get any work done next time warn your guests if you don t have it very bad impression ,0
 the high tec panel doesn t work well always stuck room is small and in a irregular shape not sound proof location is quite far from central london ,0
 not clean,0
 overpriced,0
 the service wasn t very good asked for pillows repeatedly didn t come room was not very clean bathroom extractor yuk no valances on the bed bases which were dirty holes in the walls cracks in the tiles tired furniture worn carpets etc ,0
 the location can t be beaten the separation between the two beds allows parents to hang out in one side of the room while the kids sleep in peace on the other side ,1
 the staff were extremely friendly and attentive the interior it historic and stunning the bar is cosy and yet sophisticated a good place to drink and relax in even if traveling on your own ,1
 position and quietness,1
 everything,0

 room very small chair tatty in the room ,0
 i was very desappointed no airconditioning dirty carpet holes in the walls i had no mini bar but a washing machine in my room they 220 euro breakfast not included which is by far too expensive for this ,0
 great area with lots of restaurants and cafes and public transport options a short walk from the richard lenoir pousse the hotel itself is friendly and compact loved our little balcony overlooking the park nice breakfast too ,1
 there weren t even any towels in the room i booked 5 rooms supposed to be twin but 4 were twin and one with a double bed so two grown men not related or gay had to share a bed the strand is the worst hell hole we have ever stayed in and the cost was daylight robbery they should be ashamed ,0
 room,0

 lunch service was atrocious the was poor and cold breakfast did not cater for gluten free diet was tepid at best did not know what marmalade was ,0

 one plug in the whole room terrible creaky stairs no room to work cold room spotty slow internet connection ,0
 view out of basement terrible room small clubroom not valve for money ,0
 overpriced for new years eve paid 400 per room per night and when asked if we could have a room facing the fireworks they wanted another 800 per night total extortion dirty small and below average room wouldn t pay more than 40 a night had to take 3 small children outside to watch in the freezing cold at 11 30pm because they would not let us have a room facing the fireworks rooms were empty because people refused to pay 800 they wanted ,0
 the building and the furniture is old,0

 great rooms large clean well equipped awesome staff several games at reception for kids and not only ,1
 everything thing went wrong our stay was horrible i had booked for myself 1 adult and 1 child 15yrs with breakfast included they charged me extra for that breakfast and didnt even let me know that the hotel was only booked for 1 person after all the payments for our 2 night stay and spending australian dollars 877 just for the 2 nights come to the front and realise that i had to pay an extra 50x2nights 200aud that is over 1000 our stay for only 2 nights no facilities only gym the steam bar was not varied pay to get in 20 and only african music as i young adult i was too scared to go alone and i was so bored staying up in my room on a saturday night didnt use that at all our toilet stopped working i mentioned it to the cleaners and they didnt even come to the room or let the hilton know careless i was very disappointed in my stay i will not stay again and i will not even recommend to stay there i walked out really upset ,0
 staff not friendly or flexible no parking no shuttle although they say there is a shuttle ,0
 inept staff ,0
 lovely room and a very good breakfast,1
 we arrived the hotel at the 3 30 pm and our room wasn t ready till after 5 pm we finally checked in after hours of waiting and very slow and poor service the club room is meant to be occupied by a family of 3 and we are here to stay for 8 nights the closet space in the room is ridiculous not even fitting for a single room our clothes and belongings are scattered everywhere around the room for the lack of storage or closet availability the only closet available in the room is literally 1 5 meters wide with no drawers or shelves our clothes are all in our luggage for the next 8 nights in addition to the fact that the closet is taken by the safe and the mini bar service at the hotel is very slow and almost non existent room was not prepared with enough towels in the bathroom and of course we had to wait hours for extra towels to be sent to the room there is no space whatsoever for our suitcases and as i mentioned we are a family staying together for 8 nights with a bunch of suitcases the pressure of the water in the shower is very week employees at the front desk are not cooperative in any way to try and help solve our problem the quality of the room and service is far from what we expected to see at a 5 star hotel in the center of london we looked into checking out but unfortunately it is the holiday season and all hotels around are fully booked we are extremely dissatisfied with a very gloomy lifeless windowless very small club room in addition to very poor and far from 5 star quality service whether by employees at the reception housekeeping or the concierge even after we finally got the room last night we had to wait for our luggage for an hour and we only got them when i went searching for them and was told they didn t know my room number to send the luggage up i hope you take my criticism to the hotel management as soon as possible ,0
 beds were so comfortable and the pillows excellent air conditioning and heating was easy to operate and responsive views from the room were fantastic staff were lovely and courteous from the maintenance men to restaurant bar staff concierge receptionist and doormen ,1
 very comfortable bed well sized room very clean,1
 great location as in paddington super staff offer bigger room at high floor since second day value for money when cinder london ,1
 really good location in terms of tubes stations friendly staff clean room,1
 me and my sister stayed at holiday inn paris montparnasse pasteur unfortunately the experience was not as nice as planned on saturday the 8th of april we noticed that someone at the hotel used a master key and entered our room and stole 500 euro and 50 pounds on friday night while we were out to the city we addressed the issue to the front desk as soon as we noticed that a crime was committed but the rudeness and lack of respect for a customer just shocked us so incompetent rude and arrogant staff i have never seen in my life instead of trying to help us girl at front desk was just showing attitude and was not even feeling sorry she just told us that the hotel is not taking responsibility for things like that when we asked to call the manager she said it is saturday and he is not at work and we should talk to him on monday when she knew that our stay is until sunday later she called him but the response from the manager was the same with the same rudeness and attitude a global company as big as the holiday inn can t even offer me money back from my room or a voucher to say sorry please don t stay here they are not safe not in control and don t care about customer s feelings or satisfaction our room was entered without us knowing that there is no care for safely i am just glad that i wasn t in the room by myself as i dread to think what would have happened customer service is below 0 hotel management below 0 never again staying at holiday inn ,0
 no a c ,0
 warm greeting when arriving at the hotel beautiful facilities beautiful room and views stunning bar and just overall a fantastic place ,1

 i stayed here with my daughter for a bank holiday treat excellent service from all staff and delicious food served in the room after a long day out and about very good location for theatres and covent garden faultless our second visit to this hotel we wouldn t stay anywhere else in london ,1
 crack in the sink of the bathroom tv was not working room requires to be renovated,0
 the location is great a lot of nice restaurants and caf s around the corner the subway underground is less than a minute away and that takes you directly to heathrow airport covent garden picadilly circus and knightsbridge british museum is just 5 minutes away on foot ,1
 looks fancy from the outside but very old and worn from the inside typical london mid level hotel with very high prices do not fall for the brand ,0
 the hotel location the room and staff were all excellent the cleanliness and standard of the fixtures and fittings in the room hotel generally was excellent ,1
 this is a grande olde dame of a hotel very charming right opposite russell square it is undergoing careful renovation but this is not noticeable or bothersome i stayed near the top floors and renovation has not reached there as yet i quite liked that fact and i have to say it was very nice to stay in such an olde hotel some reviewers have criticised the older rooms but i did not find fault and i stayed in a small double everything worked wifi was high speed water was very hot tv had plenty channels housekeeping was very good i have stayed in very upmarket hotels over the years and yes russell is showing her age at the top but this is being repaired a brief problem on the floor with a tripped fuse was resolved within ten minutes by maintainance unlike a previous hotel du vin that i stayed in where they did not even fix an issue in my room my entire stay so very very good staff taking care of everything all the staff from the doormen conci rge to reception were very nice and helpful to me sometimes i think guests have a duty to be decent guests also and respect the olde spirt of the hotel you stay in regarding negative reviewers on this site walking down the staircase was lovely each morning and the emerging marble lower down was fantastic you must meet george the lucky dragon he brought great luck to me that week of my stay good olde grande dame lovely staff will benefit from her renovation within ,1
 the shower suddenly open by itself in midnight and phone the front desk they said nothing can do at that moment can t change room can do nothing and really no smile and very not welcome ,0
 i stayed here with my other half for one night in december i put down a special request on my booking as we were celebrating our one year anniversary we arrived slightly early at the hotel at 13 30 but check in was 14 00 unfortunately the room wasn t ready yet but they held our bags for us and we went out as planned and checked in a bit later on once we arrived in our room later on it was beautifully decorated with 2 swan towel s on the bed with real roses all round the bed little things like this go a very long way so thank you very much ,1
 convenient location near two tube station very close to the city and all main attractions the hotel is situated in a historical building that is well kept i stayed in delux single room for 6 nights the room is small but it has everything you need wifi is available in the room and is free of charge good value for money ,1
 free upgrade and great location,1
 the attention for the childrens,1
 the quality of the rooms is quite bad overall everything in the hotel is tiny bathrooms are small and cheaply built the continental breakfast was not really eatable overcooked eggs and cheese which is wet from fat due to planned engineering works at the nearby underground station the hotel is not that easy to reach and the worst the hotel is that bad built that i woke up every time sbd used a bathroom next to above or under my room ,0
 service desk was terrible they did not know how the hotel operated at times ,0
 will not be back i spent around 1300 for 5 nights the room wasn t even worth a 3 i really wonder how this hotel can have 4 they still have those old tap in the bathroom with hot and cold water apart takes 10minutes to find right temperature because if the room next to you use water then it gets even worst i asked to change room because of it s condition the answer was we are working on improving the rooms next time we will give you one of those so the room rates is a rip off but then it gets even better at the bar where a beer 33cl cost 12 finally the fitness room really usefull as i practice everyday i mention everyday because during my stay sunday to friday the fitness room toilets included haven t been cleaned once really not once no new toilet paper roll towels that people used mine included were we left them the following day hygien 0,0
 definitely not worth the money i paid very disappointed room was quite dirty very small and noisy ,0
 noisy hotel under reconstruction relatively far from king s cross station mold in the bathroom we were awakened by the sound of the drill around 8 a m i would definetely not recommend this hotel ,0

 the room was no bigger than my laundry i am 5 2 and slim build and i had to turn sideways to fit between the desk and bedside table there was no where to put my case to easily access its contents i had to leave the bathroom door open so i had enough room to dry off after showering very poor value for money would not stay there again the room was so small i am surprised it meets regulation standards ,0
 very expensive very basic room no robe or slippers for 329 a night,0
 staff booked a room for 2 adults child to be given a small double bed in tiny room told by hotel that booking com hadn t told them there was a child in booking my paper work had child on it ,0

 we arrived in paris on october 4 2015 in the late afternoon and checked into our hotel we asked where the hotel parking was situated and were told that there were only a few parking spots and they were only for small cars and therefore were not able to park our suv we were totally misguided since the advertising showed that parking was included and size of vehicle was not specified the hotel clerk told us to park a few blocks from the hotel we proceeded to go to our room we found the carpet to be absolutely filthy we requested another room after showing us the third room it was even worse we were told that the carpet had faded also the walls had water damage best western should be informed of this situation since their reputation is at stake please refer to the pictures of the hotel room we obviously did not want to stay there however the clerk said that we were going to be charged for the four nights we immediately called bookings customer service they informed us that we would only be charged for one night because it was so late we didn t have time to look for another hotel so we stayed at the best western needless to say we had a sleepless night we checked out the next morning we were charged for that night bookings suggested a few other hotels and we chose pullman which was rated as a four star this is truly a four start hotel and we were very satisfied the best western was also rated as a four star the question is who is rating this hotel in our opinion it should have been a two star we were extremely disappointed with this best western especially since we had just come from a best western in amboise loire valley we were satisfied with it we are requesting a refund euros for the one night at best western allegro due to our dissatisfaction with the cleanliness and inconvenience we were so uncomfortable and did not sleep that night thank you for your consideration regards milos jojic,0
 we liked nothing staff was ill mannered response to calls was extremely poor as every time we had to call at least two to three time even to get a smaller things check in and check out both were extremely pathetic as every time you had to stand in the queue at least 25 45 minutes overall in spite of our best efforts we could not find a single good thing in this hotel we had come to this hotel direct from atlantis dubai and then from hilton venice as compared to both of above hotels your hotel was at worst position having no comparison at all and extremely incompatible as far as value for money is concerned ,0
 rooms small and our children were placed in a room round the corridor which was away from our room we had asked for rooms close by breakfast waited 20 minutes before having to ask for coffee and tea crowded breakfast room and guest who had pre paid for breakfast were turned away,0
 the location of this hotel is at the rear of the hilton at park lane directly opposite is their loading bay constant noise of recycling of glass bottles and heavy goods vehicles entry and exit point for staff end of shift staff from the hilton blaring radios on scooters and shouting loudly to each on breaks ,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful i enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend this hotel to anyway looking to stay in london the location cant not be beaten i put in a request to the hotel and they were more then happy to help and made my staff very welcome great hotel great staff and couldn t ask for much better ,1
 we liked the staff because they were very friendly and helpful ,1
 room was very small we were placed on the lower ground floor no views could have told us a poor way to end a 3 week european vacation picturing on the web very deceiving ,0
 internet was weak room service super bad they left our dirty glass more than one day as it is the worst thing here someone room service staff stole our christmas gifts we bought it to the kids back home and the management did nothing just in a cold word said we cannot do anything i am traveling to paris several times a year and this hotel is the worst ever also the breakfast was so poor and we have to clean our class since no one is there all the time to serve you ,0
 the location comfort and staff make up for slightly higher than average price its also worth mentioning that it is well worth getting breakfast included as the quality and selection are first class ,1
 very friendly staff and helpful,1
 no elevator bathroom floor was dirty,0
 the room was so small that the baby s bed given by the hotel almost got fit somewhere no space for bags and buggy the furniture was damaged and so old we asked for another room and a note was taken but nothing happebed ,0
 good location in a safe residential area the hotel offered subtle bus to heathrow airport which helped me a lot because i traveled alone and was carrying a big luggage ,1
 the staff at the milestone is what makes this place great i ve never stayed in a hotel with such friendly and helpful staff the hotel is small boutique yet the facilities are great it was pretty amazing to see how much they could fit into this place the location is also ideal just a short walk to the park across the street and close to shopping restaurants and the underground ,1
 variety of food ,1
 breakfast was poor really small box room bed was uncomfortable and carpet in the room was worn ,0
 every things as wifi was very low and you must pay to incearse to higher speed and the room was too small so you can leave your bags outside ,0
 we had a first class stay and would recommend 100 staff were very helpful throughout our stay including graham who drove us to the station on our departure with my mobility issues such professional customer service and so kind the food and whole ambiance of hotel really fabulous the breakfasts were stunning with the best we ve seen in a hotel we initially booked as hotel so close to 02 and with connection corridor which for my mobility issues made the whole experience two wonderful days for a special treat ,1
 the rooms were a bit too tiny my bed was not made up correctly thin sheet placed over a bare mattress not very hygienic also no staff available to correct matters,0
 rooms were nice and big very close to the tube which was handy ,1
 the size of the bed,1
 location was perfect very friendly staff clean rooms,1
 really small room rude staff you have to leave your key at the reception when you go out and when you return they give back the key without checking id which worried me a bit gnerally speaking you get what you pay it is a fair place to take in london ,0
 almost all,0
 great location for theatres and fab rooms that are a good size,1
 the room was very comfy and the breakfast was plentiful and a good choice every single member of staff i encountered was polite and friendly ,1
 the hotel is under construction and does not meet the luxury standard set by the advertisement i m guessing it will be great once construction is complete until then try another property for the money it isn t worth it ,0
 uncomfortable bed super hot room with pathetic window so couldn t sleep asked for a room with a view of water got room with a view of bins which woke us at 6 30am as they were being emptied,0
 staff were rude the rooms were small and felt dirty the bathroom was a shoebox ,0
 decor carpets old and tired as decor small rooms pillows didcusting,0
 everything was brilliant the spa was great the sky bar was as promised having the o2 on your doorstep opened up extra dining and tourist options being close to the tube meant you are not far away from the action the room was huge and had the softest bed i ve ever slept in room had a proper coffee machine and the bathroom was lovely with a huge shower can t fault the place ,1
 staff did all they could to make things happen nicole luis selena melisa all deserve a pay rise no joke ,1
 the view was amazing the hotel is wonderful and the breakfast was great already planning our visit back thank you for the best stay in paris ,1
 they gave us a room down the basement a it had hardly any air going threw the room and the rooms were too small so was the bathrooms and it is nothing like the pictures ,0
 a comfortable room reasonably priced and close to all the southbank attractions a problem we had with a noisy aircon unit was sorted out extremely quickly ,1
 the bed was super comfy and the room large by paris standards,1
 great location for all major landmarks so much so we walked to most from westminster to tower bridge staff very attentive responsive free upgrade on arrival enjoyed the whole experience so much we added another day to our visit highly recommended ,1
 staff were not overly friendly or helpful ,0
 great location and good service,1
 the rooms are very small there is hardly any space to bring your luggage with you the bed supposed to be a two persons bed but is more appropriate for one ,0
 i didn t like the hotel because i booked a double room with twin beds and they gave me single room with king bed only because therevis no rooms ,0
 we arrive the reception staff are horrible our rooms at 1 30pm are not ready they give us rooms without air conditioning that are in dire condition there is no valet no car parking not even a luggage man in front of the hotel to take our luggage in it was a nightmare this hotel has gone down from a 4 star hotel to a 2 star hotel staff are unfriendly with bad attitude property and rooms are shabby and disgusting 2 days passed without room being made up ,0
 shabby carpets no toileteries un friendly staff specially females no slippers in the room overall abad experience and will not stay again ,0
 i had a double room and the bed was comfy and a decent size good tv as well,1
 we had a check in time of 3 pm we checked in at 10 am and left our bags in til 3 pm traveled back at 6pm and the room was still not ready we didn t get our room till 7 15 pm we were given a free drink for waiting and i stayed there as i am a acor member not good enough ,0
 rooms very small hardly any plugs and there wasn t any plugs by the mirrors minimal wardrobe space wifi code expired during our stay ,0
 the friendlyness and great support of mme florence must be mentioned here thanks a lot ,1
 staff we re great very friendly and helpful especially serena on the reception desk great location to commute to and from ,1
 no wash clothes and no sheets or blankets to cover up in bed as we americans know them double charged for breakfast each and every day once for downstairs restaurant where i never went and once in my room where i ate all my meals construction outside 24 hours a day made sleep all but impossible ,0
 the bed was very comfy good wifi reception polite staff,1
 beds very comfortable quiet rooms fabulous views from enormous windows everything perfect especially when graham the concierge told us about the door to the o2 arena our concert finished and within 10 minutes we were in the stunning bar on the top floor of the hotel avoiding all the queues getting out of the o2 brilliant great concert but the hotel was the icing on the cake ,1
 excellent rooms with very comfy beds ,1
 no breakfast provided even with additoinal charge bathroom was a unified room with toilet with water almost filling the entire room ,0
 we were upgraded to a premium executive room as their guest of the day and we had a free full breakfast each to go with it couldn t fault the hotel at all ,1
 the location was near to all the places we wanted to visit and the neighbourhood is very nice,1
 the staff were welcoming and friendly the hotel was clean and had lovely fresh flowers everywhere the lifts were efficient ,1
 every thing the hotel is awful noisy also quite old really terrible hotel thanx to paris changed our mood hotel was awful ,0
 they charged me several times by accident ,0
 as above,0
 i got a upgrade to a club room which is basically in the basement don t recommend getting that room it was really run down and just kinda filthy it says it was a non smoking hotel but i constantly smelled smoked in my room the shower was really small and the bed uncomfortable ,0
 the rooms the old forniture the staff,0
 hotel not been kept in good condition air con no good,0
 mainly the advert of their room looks completely different to the actual room ,0
 this is an over rated price hotel damaged furniture noisy air conditioning units construction behind room additionally the person at the front desk was beyond rude they charge a lot of money with all these bad stuff and at the top they make you pay for wifi unacceptable ,0
 most of it,0
 great position few minutes walk from the tube good breakfast buffet comfortable bed but i was on my own i guess this was a double bed in which case it guess it can only house a tiny couple ,1
 i loved the exciting room it had all the lovely touches you expect from a good room to bed slippers etc,1
 no bar service in the terrace garden dirty old gym beds are hard no airco nice building put poorly managed could have been turned into something wonderfull ,0
 didn t have breakfast at hotel rooms good size for paris very clean and very comfortable,1
 everything,0
 we travelled as a family 2 adults and 1 child and had to squeeze into a double bed and no provision for our 3 year old,0
 everything firstly the room was amazing for a small double this was more than expected the breakfast was lovely and you can eat as much as you like buffet style the view from the room was lovely over the fountains and would always come back,1
 the double room is fit only for a single person ,0
 poor facilities and the rooms were small no air conditioning during winter and not comfortable,0
 the room was absolutely tiny never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 euro is awful first night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger,0
 location perfect staff we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the park plaza building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel it wasn t the staff at the park plaza westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the park plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back they were all smiley and happy to assist us on the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright the lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready it was a quick 10min wait which was fine no greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the spectrum bar it was 1500h and the bar was definitely not busy the difference between our experience between the staff from both park plaza hotels was just really evident that i had to put it here room superior room we stayed for our anniversary we got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels we were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night the tv monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc the bedroom and bath were just the right size it was not small but not too big as well we didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right mini bar was stocked with the basics we liked that there were extra pillows for us to use bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean breakfast good old continental and english breakfast ,1
 it was impossible to sleep the single paned windows leading directly onto tottenham court road meant that every conversation siren car lorry and bus could be heard never again ,0
 room was awful tiny sink the size of a a4 sheet of paper with no plug a brick wall for a view not what you would expect for 275 per night very dissatisfied ,0
 my room being searched by the staff just after i checked in and left for the day my safe was searched and things were stolen no one took blame staff are all liars,0
 for the price paid 1 2 normal rate i thought this was a good value hotel plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities the room was smallish but well laid out i stayed for one night the location is great and if you re visiting london for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at paddington ,1
 great location easy access to the metro very quiet at night so a good nights sleep in a very comfy bed with excellent air con a short walk to bars and restaurants in proper paris very few tourists but a great location to hop on the metro to see all the sights would definitely stay again ,1
 the view was stunning the bed really comfortable,1
 extremely welcoming staff and wonderfully comfortable beds and pillows great location for the o2 which is 2mins walk almost under covet,1
 the staff were attentive and professional,1
 staff were rude unprofessional not helpful and non chalon i tried to set a romantic jacuzzi for my husband the sprinklers were activated and we were drenched along with our macbook clothes and food ruining our 5th anniversary the staff moved us next door but we were given nothing complimentary in fact we were made to feel like it was our fault and were promptly asked to leave at 11am we have stayed in hotels around the world and have never been made to feel like this after spending 400 a night for a room we would have attest expected a complimentary breakfast this hotel is horrible and i pity anyone prepared to invest there hard earned money into a shambles such as this we are horrified and will never be returning here ,0
 the neighbourhood was not that great breakfast was not good at all ,0
 upon arrival my girlfriend was not happy with the view from our room on the 3rd floor so reception kindly upgraded us to a suite on the 14th floor with an exceptional view of london and surrounding areas in the morning i d forgotten my swim shorts in la and wanted to use the spa and swimming pool and concierge kindly offered to visit the westfield shopping mall and pick me up a pair in my size outstanding service and very kind polite and friendly ,1
 loved the location very grand old style hotel everything was perfect lovely room and bathroom staff very friendly ,1
 room,0
 hotel forgot the wake up call not acceptable when you travel for business,0
 location is great ,1
 the rooms was too small and overall it is not a four star hotel bathrooms was very small water was leaking from the tap and from the bath cabin ,0
 honestly it dosnt worth to say it is 5 star hotel as i travel a lot and always stay in 5 star hotels and comparing to others this property absolutely dosnt worth 4 stars the housekeeping cleaners start from early morning closing doors and opening doors aggressively that make noise at the corridor without caring that some people are still sleeping secondly they knock the door once or twice and they enter the room without permission in addition 3 nights i am calling the room service late night and they never pickup and i end with the reception answering me and i ordered through them moreover at the day of check out at 9 30 am we have received a call from the reception saying that your check out today yes i know that my check out is today but why do they call me early morning so i woke up thirsty and tried to open the fridge and it was locked because i am checking out today but still it is 9 30 am we have till noon i called the housekeeping to get me some water because they didn t put the night before bottles when they cleaned the room and the housekeeping answered me with full confident we don t have water we distribute after 6 00 pm is this a service we get in a 5 star hotel finally at 11 00am the girl from reception called me to say that you are checking out today and i am trying to withdraw from the card but it dosnt authorize i dont know who authorized her to take from my card and the bill was full of mistakes when i went down and reviewed my bill this is absolutely not normal for a 5 star hotel and i dont understand why is the price for rooms are so high and the service is too bad it is not insulting to your staff but really this property should train their staff up to the standards of 5 star hotels staff should serve the guests ,0
 awesome location just outside the sorbonne helpful staff comfy room albeit a bit small ,1
 the hotel was amazing the room we had was lovely and clean beautiful view the staff was polite and helpful we paid extra to have the breakfast it was lovely ,1
 staff,1
 excellent room clean modern and a very comfortable bed very helpful staff ,1
 beds food and management,0
 location amazing room with a lovely view breakfast was delicious with so much variety ,1
 rude check in staff,0
 nice and helpful staff beautiful lobby and sitting room on the ground floor and frescoed ceilings in the older part of the building well kept property and it has elevators the location is convenient to buses at the street corner and subway a block away short walk to the kensington gardens and hyde park as to the room the a c was optimal and you could open the window although just a bit if you wanted to ,1
 hotel was worn out needs lots of fixing not worth the money,0
 a cell phone with unlimited worldwide use great for calling family back home ,1
 we had no sleep until 3am because our room was over the lounge and they where having a party all night it was very unfair to put us in a room over the lounge when they knew they would be a party all night when we complained to the staff the next morning he didn t seem to care the staff were cold ,0
 staff were friendly and helpful location having left luggage looked after and brought to you ,1
 the rooms were tired and very uncomfortable the first room the toilet seat was not even attached the 2nd room the tv remote did not work and the tv was on the wall to the side of the bed so you could not even see it,0
 rooms far too small very claustrophobic would not describe it as a double bed small also ,0
 the room is inhumanly small and out of shape ,0
 the bed really confortable location is good walking distance to tube and train ,1
 it was outdated the chairs in the entry were dirty i would not sit on them ,0
 location was wonderful property was beautiful and staff was helpful ,1
 i particularly liked the excellent customer service the hotel maintenance guy david fixed the retractable handle of my carry on luggage that got detached it was very much appreciated because we were just starting our holiday and my other option was to find a samsonite service center in london to take it to and i m not sure if they were going to be able to repair it quickly the reception staff was always helpful and accommodating the breakfast buffet was great and the best we had in the hotels we stayed in during our 3 week holiday in london and europe ,1
 reception staff were extremely friendly and helpful beds were very comfortable great location ,1
 all staff at hotel were extremely courteous and helpful absolutely first class treatment in all areas we really enjoyed the hotel excellent,1
 clean facilities ,1
 dirty,0
 everything,0
 room size,0
 the beds were amazing so comfortable was difficult to get up for breakfast in the morning the staff were excellent and the convenience of being a 3 minute walk from the o2 was fantastic ,1
 everything else it s by far the smallest room i ve been in my life you couldn t open the bathroom door even half way because it got blocked by the bed the same happened with the closet door it got blocked by the room door the staff looked demotivated the shower didn t work properly it was a very poor experience,0
 nice and helpfull staff clean room ,1
 hotel is in dire need of upgrading in every area except the outside front ,0
 location first impressions as you walk in the seating arrangements and furniture in bar area breakfasts staff were extremely helpful also located close to two tube lines these give easy access into central london good for the price i paid however would not have been happy if i paid full price ,1
 reception well staffed by cheerful and very helpful team cleaner and better appointed room than much more expensive alternatives will definitely retain as option for future trips to london,1
 swimming pool out of order an arrogant hotel manager with side kick front of house male staff member with perpetual smirk on his face whilst i complained that the hotel was not up to standard ,0
 location,1
 my room had no window and no heating whatsoever but a cold air was blowing from the radiator which made the room even colder when asked the staff gave me an electric heater but it eats up the oxygen in the room and by morning i had a sore throat the breakfast was extensive though the bacon was fried to hard ,0
 beautiful hotel very professional and super pleasant staff ,1
 room gave you privacy whilst accommodating a family and the location with the easy access to waterloo and the river the view from the room was great ,1
 the view was terrible as the building site view from the window was a bit much had to order the mini bar if you wanted it the room was very small for the money we paid only one chair for a double room ,0
 the family room given to us was big the kids got a lotsa room to play around we had a double bed and a single sofa bed with a pull out in the room loves the separate shower area in the bath room the bath tub is extremely clean and the water pressure was good the room was very clean the front desk service gentlemen were really nice on our first night there as there s no nearby food outlets the service guy proactively recommended some food delivery services and provided us some leaflets and recommendation we had nice hot yummy pizzas and japanese food delivered right to our room the location is about 8min walk to the metro easy asses to where we need to go ,1
 extremely helpfull staff charming hotel great beds ,1
 the bathroom was very good,1
 staff at breakfast made you sit where they wanted you to see it in a near empty breakfast room the bed was two singles pushed together very uncomfortable and small for a couple not a 5 star hotel room service menu poor,0
 the hotel was well situated for a visit to the center of london and was very comfortable i believe the hotel has had a refurb because the rooms are somewhat like a spaceship with wooden panels hiding the walls but it works the staff were friendly its a hotel for visitng a city where the room is to relax and sleep but the hotel offers little else other than a coffee and thats what we wanted ,1
 the photos on the website are misleadsing,0
 the beds were incredible the overall level of service comfort and willingness of the staff was exceptional particularly enjoyed the quality of the breakfast buffet and the view from the sky bar ,1
 very very small rooms central heating had air in it and clicked all night what anoyed me was at check out i told the staff and in typical french maner the girl could not care less not even a cursory sorry nothing strange for a us owned business ,0
 location is really great,1
 room was quiet and well positioned for views over westminster appreciate being given this as one guest would have felt very uncomfortable without ,1
 the bed was a 10 10 ultimate comfort spacious room lovely view very professional staff ,1
 hair on the bed sheets repetitive smelly rooms and carpets,0
 great beds great breakfast,1
 for a start the ac wasn t working and the heating was on full our bathroom door was broken and staff kept coming into our room about 4x when i was sleeping and when i came out the shower on top of that i paid extra to check in later than 11am and still got woken up by staff coming into my room when i told the guy at the checkout all i got was an apology but no refund or anything offered not happy with the service of this hotel at all,0
 great location well running facilities and helpful staff ,1
 best location for the o2 lovely bar on the top floor with great views unfortunately the air con had broken so was a little hot for our visit comfy beds ,1
 nothing staff bed comfort room storage 0 10,0
 very close to the tube station and straight onto kensington gardens hotel is very grand and our suite was excellent ,1
 excellent comfortable room,1
 good location nice friendly staff ,1
 all rooms are like shoe boxes staff are unhelpful if you want a bath you have to request it we paid for a delux double room the room was that small the bed nearly touched every wall we complained and got upgraded to a club room which was also a lot smaller that the photos suggested ,0
 the garden was a bonus lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink secure parking was also a good feature ,1
 staff wasn t friendly room aircon not working no hot water in the shower ,0
 everything ,1
 extremely comfy beds amazing soft bedding loved the duvet and the pillows all staff was heavenly professional and at your service at any time views to die for you can see londons skyline from everywhere the rooftop bar is fab ,1
 i had a robbery problem in hotel while i was going to airport i noticed that my duty free package was left in the room i opened my baggage but it wasnt there then i immediately called the hotel but they didnt find it i have never had a situation like this before i will never prefer this hotel anymore and no one will make a reservation to this hotel ,0
 rooms too small,0
 location athmosphe service,1
 the view from our penthouse room was amazing the location is perfect and we couldn t fault the hotel the staff were really friendly and made our three year old daughter welcome they give the children a passport with money tokens for them to spend at the bar the room was very clean and modern we loved our three night stay ,1
 nothing ,0
 loved the sky sports in the room,1
 modern hotel with excellent facilities bathroom was fab ,1
 my over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay ,0
 excellent atmosphere nice building excellent beds beautiful lobby ,1
 very welcoming staff good restaurant and shop,1
 the kitchenette in the room is just the thing a family needs the view of london eye is great the staff is quite responsive to all needs this includes everyone from front desk restaurant housekeeping and concierge they were very courteous and helpful to us the breakfast is very good too a lot of variety the hotel location is the best part very close to the waterloo station a number of trains to places outside of london originate terminate here couple of bus stops are also nearby westminster bridge london eye and other tourist attractions on the river bank are just a short walk the county hall area has a few decent restaurants a starbucks and a convenience store the booking com offer of free entry tickets to various attractions saved us a lot of money it is a very good offer ,1
 the very helpful and friendly staff especially cesar in the restaurant and wilfredo always cheerful and ready to help in any way first class facilities and decor you even had good weather for us very considerate please email our invoice thanks ,1
 the staff were extremely helpful and the hotel was very nice and well maintained ,1
 room was tired and needs a major renovation ,0
 beautiful old building with lots of history attached to it along with very helpful friendly staff,1
 we visited for a weekend break we checked in to the room which was very small and noisy and headed out for something to eat and drink when we arrived back to the hotel albeit early hours of saturday morning the hotel was locked and in darkness we had no option but to knock continuously on the window until someone came to let us in very unprofessional we were told breakfast was included when we arrived to breakfast there was 1 croissant a few slices of packaged ham and some cheese there were some stale biscuits and half a jar of apple juice we were told we could upgrade to a full english for additional expense needless to say we left and went elsewhere shocking service by staff who didn t seem to care i will never revisit ,0
 the toilet was dirty and used without cleaning the price is very high the shower was damaged the pressure hose was leaking they are not changing the bed sheet every day they hold one night deposit in addition to the total amount there services are very slow the room is very small ,0
 very neat and clean good wifi easy access to subway station 5 to 7 minutes by walk breakfast was ok hotel is on a quiet street some of the stuff was helpful and smiling ,1
 a beautiful building evoking the style of days gone by the location was excellent for travel around london good facility of the underground and commercial parking nearby the breakfast was lovely and if booked as part of a package deal great value for money wonderful staff ,1
 very old and dated rooms not very modern very very dated and rooms without window not completely clean staff didn t seem to know what to do when dealing with my complain about the room we had t change rooms and the room we were given was dirty tiny and bathroom dirty,0
 it is a big and busy hotel rooms are fine but small ,0
 staff are very friendly location is superb clean rooms and excellent housekeeping,1
 breakfast internet elevator,0
 staff keeps on following and checking on us all the time,0
 a must place to stay if you are attending an event at the o2 the hotel itself is fantastic modern and has a touch of quality compared to others the rooms are faultless with one of the comfiest beds i have ever slept in stylish bathroom with good shower not to mention the built in bose speakers in the ceiling they re quality cracking views over looking the river and the arena itself staff were also super helpful and approachable if it is the price putting you off don t let it its worth every penny would definitely stay again ,1
 staff was excellent layed back and friendly,1
 the rooms are not clean and old the furniture is to old also they treated people different if you shout and ask to change rooms in they will upgrade you my booking was long time back for two interconnected rooms but they gave them to someone eals and told as to wait for the next day to change rooms ,0
 location is awesome hotel close to all attraction ,1
 very relaxing,1
 location,1
 i stay in two different time first from june 28 to july 02 problem with air conditioner made 3 claims no properly protection in the shower and flooding the floor second time from 10 to 15 of july different floor everythind is new i had no problem good the way the crew of the hotel was very good,1
 when you arrive and you pay for your room then they want a deposit of 50 this is unfair because it is not written anywhere when you book your room air conditioning doesn t work properly stinky air comes out when you turn it on ,0
 very wide range of food available for breakfast and well cooked too the bed was amazingly comfortable and the staff were so polite helpful and well spoken and informative ,1
 unfortunately we didn t get her name but the lady at reception was extremely great at her job was very friendly helpful and professional she knew it was my girlfriends birthday and when we got back from a trip to central london there was a chocolate cake in our room very nice touch for her to arrange this amazing,1
 the organisation of hotels bedroom value for money staff,0
 great location really near to earls court tube station and restaurants friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds nice hotel with modern touches definitely stay again ,1
 location size of the room large bathroom breakfast was ok,1
 comfy bed large selection for breakfast ,1
 very good location near earls court metro stop,1
 i was charged for by the gym which isn t made clear but the lovely reception staff said it didn t matter very lovely staff post brexit the sevice industry is going to suffer,1
 ridiculous price paid 60 more than 2 months ago and was given a smaller room which i had been told at reception was a delux room i was very embarrassed with my new partner ,0
 very run down would not stay again ,0
 most comfiest bed i ve come across in a hotel heated mirror and floors in the bathroom preventing misting up brilliant idea ,1
 no wifi no phone in room no one on reception often not welcoming the name on building says the mitre not innkeepers lodge i said that evening i am booked to say here in 2 weeks time and i hsve already paid but i dont want to come back could i have my money back and young woman said no manager not here the only low light on my first trip to uk ireland and europe a brillint trip other than my 2 nights at innkeepers lodge the mitre ,0

 the wrong info given by the front desk the bathroom needed so much services and extra extra cleaning ,0
 the hotel is old and room is too small and on top of this the ac is not working in all the hotel as when we ask for a fan they told no more as all the fans given to other rooms brecfast is very poor and not enough for all guests the night duty manager is careless to all guests and keep on telling for any thing this is not my business you should see my colleague the refrigerator also in all rooms not working you have to go to the par to get cold drink even water in all on all very bad experience not advisable to any one ,0

 the rooms were tiny there was little lighting in the room and it appeared that there were too separate sides of the hotel one for commoners and one for the people who were paying more i m not sure how much more because i was spending 350 definitely not worth its money ,0

 three false fire alarms in the night and no apology or real response from the staff we had to go down to the front desk to be told there was a fault with the system we then had a wake up call at 4am with explanation or apology tiny room could barely pass between the bed which was fold up and the wall shocking for almost 300 gbp a night no help with luggage on arrival or departure these are five star prices with three star rooms and two star service ,0

 easy to find very well situated for our own personal requirements the visiting of the o2 centre staff were very friendly and attentive ,1
 great staff love the location ,1
 many thing i did not like among them the following 1 they charged me 100 euro per day as a guarantee though the hotel policy as shown in booking com says nothing about that the reception lady insisted to charge this ridicules amount 2 the hotel did not pay attention to our special request and we had to wait for more than 2 hrs to get our room the reception lady was so rude and informed us that the check in time is at 14 00 and not 12 00 as stated in booking com she blamed booking com for the inaccurate information 3 upon our arrival to the room we were shocked by the miserable doubled bed we got two single beds closed to each other with out any joint when you sleep on this doubled bed it is very likely to fall down in the middle of the gab which would be created and 4 the stuff has no respect to the guest privacy our room was crashed twice by the hotel stuff while we were resting there with out our permission the hotel does not look like a 4 stars hotel it lacked any facility of which qualifies this property to be ranked as a 4 stars hotel they have no porter ,0

 very nice room modern design comfortable,1
 the room was very comfortable spacious and well equipped the staff at check in and out were really friendly and through we stayed to see a concert at the 02 and although we had to pay extra for the hotel parking it was still really convenient it was a special treat but would do the same again if the opportunity arises ,1
 the room was too small facing a dirty roof the bed throw and the sheets smelled as if not washed for long time old kettle and carpet smells bad ,0
 not worth for price ,0

 great location in paris walking distance from great destinations le marais notre dame and rue st honore would definitely return ,1
 awful room awful service at front desk can t begin to explain how poor this hotel is have stayed in better hotel ibis ,0
 nothing nothing,0
 check in was simple and fast on entering the lift there was a large notice saying keep bags where you can see them and thieves operate in this area the room was ok but very run down it had damp in the corner and the services like hairdryer did not work the worst thing was the rats in the hotel we spotted a number of them and did complain to the reception via phone but was not called back by the manager as promised on check out we explained the hotel was not very clean generally and they had an issue with rats the reception refused to get the manager and told us we needed to send an email they also explained that the rats were due to building works next door and location of the hotel to the river this is one hotel to avoid needs a good refit and some general tlc it reminded me of the hostels in asia when backpacking at least those guys were friendly ,0
 overcharged by 920 and still waiting for the refund told it will take a week yet it took them 5 minutes to clear out my bank account leaving me massivley overdrawn and bank charges daily which hotel have said they are not refunding disgusting rang hotel 8 times now left 6 messages for manager to call me but he hasn t ,0

 staff behaviour ,0
 staff are very good regular visitor and they always remember me helpful and fast ,1
 everything ,1
 perfect location iconic building and friendly staff,1
 wonderful room almost an apartment and very comfortable very close to the things we wanted to visit ,1
 when we arrived at the hotel we had no use of electric at all in our room this went on for about 20 minutes when we finally got help they had unplugged the kettle and the safe so we had no use of either of these the pillow cases had stains all over them and there was rubbish all over the bedroom floor they claim to have upgraded us to one of their club rooms but i do not believe they did this ,0
 the layout of the room the helpful staff and the indian menu really good ,1
 room was tiny supposed to be a deluxe double it was in the basement so very dark and warm could not open the windows as people were smoking outside all the time was very noisy was woken up both days at 4 30 am there was building work going on wish i had been told as i would have cancelled will not return ,0
 we got a room as big as a closet which was anything but clean after complaining at the reception we were given another room which was larger this was fortunately fairly clean otherwise the room was old and everything was in need of replacement the carpet was replaced with other pieces not a hotel to get a return ,0
 beds were hard quite outdated,0
 great location just off the blvd st michel breakfast was excellent ,1
 cleanness old furniture no smiling from most of its staff very bad tv flowing of water in chair of bathroom is very weak non lovely smell,0
 location was good for us clean rooms ,1
 personal use of aircon temperature ,1
 the toilet was dirty had yellow water the location was not very good either as it is quite far from any local shops restaurants activites etc ,0
 room was comfortable and quiet even though on street level,1
 the location was perfect close to two tube lines that easily put us in different parts of the city the hotel was clean our room was quiet and the staff was friendly and personable ,1
 cleanliness of bathroom ,0
 good location easy enough to get to by tube from kings cross and lovely that the history has been preserved great choice at breakfast i ve stayed twice with different friends and they both agreed it was lovely ,1
 the hotel lies within minutes away from big ben and london eye waterloo station is the nearest underground station and it will take you anywhere you want in london perfect lacation ,1
 arrived only to find they said they could not accomodate us as the hotel has water problems they offered us a hotel in paddington so was most annoyed as i booked notting hill and not paddington never will stay here again ,0
 we liked the style of the hotel opulent and classic in the main areas lovely helpful staff very modern very clean bedrooms ,1
 ideally located with close proximity to tube station 200m ,1
 service is absolutely not for a four star millenium hotels staff and service are not caring for the customers if you get the service at all expect to follow up at least 4 times absolutely not recommending to anyone breakfast overpriced an old facilities ,0
 very nice staff and comfortable and quiet room very friendly welcome and very helpful desk staff ,1
 on arrival we were upgraded from a superior room to a studio apartment which was excellent the bathroom was very nice with a lovely bath and fantastic shower the staff were very pleasant and the doorman was happy to stand out in the rain until he could hail us down a taxi the cocktails in the bar were very good particularly the pina colada we didn t manage to sample the breakfast but overall i was very happy with my choice of hotel,1
 i have been a regular guest for 5 years and this is the worst experience ever i may not consider staying in this hotel again looks like they give priority and more care to guests who are staying for business purpose i e conference events 1 furniture was kinda damaged 2 beds make sound and not comfortable toilet base make sound every time you flash 2 house keeping clean the room only upon guest s request they don t clean good 3 at the time of check out they charged us for using the mini bar although we just took them out to put our stuff in the fridge and we returned all items in the fridge the night before we check out the problem is that it took them 30 mins to send someone to check the mini bar while we are checking out which made us late for the airport 4 some staff especially at the reception are aggressive 5 breakfast options were very bad comparing to my previous stays ,0
 the room and bathroom was extremely small but the most oppressive thing was the elevator which barely fit 2 adults with no luggage and you could not fit if you breathed normally just ridiculous there is no concierge so you have to rely on the front desk folks to help you and while they tried to help they were not very helpful with things like dinner reservations which were an absolute nightmare ,0
 staff were rude ,0
 everything else very old and tired hotel food quality was extremely poor and breakfast was so bad even though it was included within the 4 nights i stayed there i ate out for two of them as it was so bad ,0
 the staff were extremely polite and helpful the single rooms although small were very well equipped modern and clean ,1
 the smell in the room was shocking i asked to move because of the strong smell of drains and they said no don t stay here ,0
 undoubtedly the worst mercure hotel in the world it was being renovated but for 267 a night was vastly over priced considering the state of the building and the dreadful lift system much needs to be done to make it satisfactory and worth even half the room rate the mercure brand is badly damaged by this property ,0
 very small delux room,0
 the rooms carpet is smelly the toilets are dirty the lobby and entrance smells cooking the air conditioning are hot no parking asked to change the room but they didn t the break fast buffet was terrible and crowded no plates poor food variety no arabic channels on tv although i am a member in accor club i didn t like this pullman the pullman bercy is the best ,0
 the toilet overflowed which can happen to anyone but they did not deal with it in an effective manner i brought the problem to their attention at 11am as sewer was overflowing in the room and by 12midnight it was not addressed it was after midnight when we were given a new room the room was for three persons and the beds were only dressed for 2 they also provided no towels shocking experience when i spoke to the night manager he took no responsibility and blamed the day manager for not addressing the problem ,0
 excellent position good size room and bathroom ,1
 urine dripping from the light fitting in the bathroom carpet worn through window wall damp with yellow staining not a 4 star ,0
 too expensive 350 night didn t deserve the money although a 5star hotel the rooms too small clean and quite new but the rooms have a small view to thames mostly to sky skrapers and to under construction buildings the room had a window note a balcony the room had no bath robe and for sleepers we had to request for the comments on booking were very good and the photos showed the hotel on the river so you suppose all the rooms with river view have the good view of thames but no i wouldn t recommend it in addition when we came back we discovered after 4 days bites from bed bugs in our body we have the suspicion that it is from the hotel but we are not 100 sure in the price the breakfast wasn t included for which we paid 19 pounds person it was good and from the restaurant we had a good view of thames and the bridge ,0
 rooms are tiny even by london standards blinds do not cover the window so sun light beams into the room at 4 30am internal facing rooms are even worse never again ,0
 shower was dirty hairs one shower knob was broken and left in the shower tray shower door did not close really poor attention to detail in room preparation very very noisy,0
 the receptionist was very friendly i arrived about 10pm to check in and he was most helpful upbeat smiley and made me feel welcome he actually gave me a free upgrade which was very nice of him i was only there on business and would be checking out 8 hours later at 6am and the upgrade was an added perk ,1
 we arived the hotel late in the night and the staff service was exelent without extra charge upgraded our room the ducks idea is unique and fun,1
 location is great ,1
 no communication between staff they mixed up our rooms messed up our breakfast and made us promises they didn t keep our stay was booked 4 months in advance and they still couldn t get it right not happy ,0
 4 start hotel should do more than a poor service every thing is chargeable even water the size of the room is so small and the design is very strange can not understand it the matters and pillow is very poor quality and had strong headaches every day morning ,0
 hotel and room were nice and good location,1
 everything was great the staff were very very helpful,1
 pillows were not comfortable so had a terrible sleep the water from the shower had very little pressure even when adjusted to the maximum the all so tech gadget that runs the lights and air con etc froze and crashed a few times so i couldn t even turn the light out or put my air con on the tv signal kept on scrambling so i couldn t even watch a movie ,0
 staff try their best in poor english no management visible or contactable ,0
 second visit to this hotel and again the service location staff were all excellent the rooms are well equipped and spotless the beds are so comfortable you just don t want to get up in the morning would recommend to anyone ,1
 the staff was always friendly and helpful breakfast was great cleaning person amazing great location great restaurants nearby ,1
 ongoin renovations meant there was no heating when it was zero degrees outside ,0
 lack of facilities poor bar service especially when west ham are playing at home ,0
 radiator in room sounded like a kettle boiling and the air conditioning for the kitchen was outside our window not nice at 5 am accompanied with the smell of cooking complained they did absolutely zero,0
 rooms are extremely tiny no shelves at all imagine nowhere to put things and clothes on very very poor breakfast omelette was swimming in milk fried eggs smelled like something has burnt no waiters it seems the lady helping around was combining a position of a waiter cleaning lady saw her throwing the garbage outside and a cook i totally do not recommend to stay in this hotel pictures are lies ,0
 room very quiet and smart,1
 beautiful building and great location 3 minutes from the tube ,1
 location parking,1
 great another place where free w lan means w lan does not exist will that story ever end ,0
 staff somewhat rude not allowing check in until it was exact 2 pm we were there 1 hour before not even 5 minutes to 2 pm asking us to wait well it takes at least 5 minutes to process check in with somebody with confirmed booking torn lounge in room covered with a grey sheet such was the lounge which should go to junkyard not in a so called 4 star hotel dirty chair with stains ,0
 staff at the sky bar were friendly,1
 their room so small,0
 got charged before getting to hotel number of times without knowing then charge room rate paid for trip 5 times and wouldn t give money back never had trouble with any other crown plaza just this one would not advise going ,0
 this hotel is the best one i did in paris i was travelling with my 2 daughters and they ve been welcome as princesses seeing their big smile on their face was priceless the hotel room was beautiful comfy and quiet even the breakfast was great with real fresh orange juice i travel a lot i did many hotels in paris but this one is so great i m sure to go back next time i go to paris ,1
 very bad experience as i lost more than 700 euros it was stolen from my bag i just knew when i arrived back ,0
 2 single beds stuck together does not make a double the breakfast was a expensive as far as hotels go room was very warm with no air conditioning shower took a a lot of pulling stained carpet on the wall no view from the window really expensive considering the quality ,0
 the staff very friendly and easy to approach we booked two rooms and travelled with small baby and the lady at the reception was so kind to allocate us and my parents on the same floor she saw us coming with the baby stroller and accommodate us in a bigger corner room with more space i would definitely recommend that hotel if you are visiting paris with a small baby the hotel rooms are really quiet and no noise from the street or neighbouring rooms there is also a lift very tiny but that s paris so you should be happy to have one at all lovely quiet street overlooking the park nice design very clean probably 5 min walk from the nearest metro station but we used it once as we walked pretty much everywhere very comfortable bed location is good if you not looking for a very busy part of paris but close to bastille or nation if i would be visiting paris again i would book that hotel for sure again wifi really good my parents had much smaller room but with a sofa their toilet was much smaller and the only comment from my dad was that if there would be bigger person than it would be quiet difficult for them to turn around in that toilet or get into shower but hey it s paris and we liked the place and we fitted in the toilet lol,1
 room was extremely small for a club room,0
 noise no air condition too small rooms not polite staff ,0
 very bad hotel i will never come bake to this hotel,0
 everything else,0

 room was very comfy and modern one of the nicest bathrooms of any hotel i ve seen staff were very helpful and courteous the location in relation to the o2 was perfect ,1
 i liked the fact that our grown up daughter could comfortably stay with us without having to pay for another room ,1
 location and the staff,1
 we were relocated to the grand royale london hyde park due to a maintenance problem excellent service from staff at both hotels and provided with complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience breakfast was better than the hilton s v convenient for tube and bus routes this hotel is brimful of history and has its own theatre,1
 friendly staff,1
 lovely quiet room comfortable bed friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast great location,1
 lovely old style hotel very retro british lobby and exterior room was renovated and shower room new and functional ,1
 it was very nice experience thanks for high quality of services and big thanks for simon charles and alex ,1
 lovely room great views ,1
 cleaning staff leave towels on floor causing difficulty in narrow corridors suggested to my mum she could not have the pre paid room when i was arriving two days later with the credit card got there and reception did not even want to check credit card no consistency,0
 room was extremely comfortable perfect location surrounding very well kept with superb views ,1
 comfortable beds and great location,1
 the room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain the room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat there is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in when i asked why i hadn t got any complementary water i was told it was because i booked through you i made a fuss and did get it in the end but i felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights ,0
 youthhostel flair,0
 poor room service poor support poor of whatever the guest needs,0
 clearly the staff didn t even care and lie to me right in my face saying that the hotel didn t receive my request i said that because when i was asked to fill up the check in form my email and request was attached behind it what a joke that s very disappointing and that shows how attentive the hotel was to the traveller ,0
 very nice hotel relatively big rooms tidy environment they gave discount due to fire alarm issues ,1
 in general all ,1
 stains on the bathroom walls that clearly showed the place hadn t been cleaned properly furniture is pretty old and needs updating ,0

 small entrance staircase in the hotel we ended up at breakfast was served in another building staff at breakfast could speak better english and have been more helpful staff at reception not all that well informed etc ,0
 facilities and a room excellent and extremely comfortable bed and an excellent breakfast everyone catered for the eighteen sky bar is brilliant ,1
 room condition poor quality minibar with half empty products old furniture,0

 very uncomfortable bed double was two singles pushed together ,0
 you could hear the people upstairs walking around was woken up early by cleaners making a noise outside in corridor taking etc an banging etc an only had cold water on taps in bathroom ,0
 i stay every year sometimes twice a year when i exhibit at olympia it is really convenient was very impressed that i got an upgrade to breakfast on this occassion it was a nice touch i don t eat enough breakfast to warrant paying over 10 but being offered a free breakfast meant i could enjoy some fresh fruit and tea before heading off ,1
 location,1
 everything about this hotel was top notch the hotel is perfectly located near key attractions but not too in the middle of the tourist mess the rooms are elegant and well appointed with luxurious modern amenities the staff is attentive as suits the level a luxury hotel demands they went over the top in every aspect while it is not for budget travelers the value of the hotel is well beyond what it costs i will never stay anywhere else ,1
 don t stay if it s a business trip as it doesn t cater to business people the rooms lobby and gym don t look like the photos on the website it is a really old hotel but not in a good way ,0
 big comfy bed generous breakfast well worth the money ,1
 really bed uncomfortable bed ,0
 the force me to change one bedroom to suite because of my son 6 years who should stay with me and his mother even i am taking 3 rooms as a total,0
 loud music in foyer and bar on some occasions would seem to be staff who control it at a level they want badly trained staff on the concierge desk who gave us 4 different locations for an evening bus tour all of which were wrong sloppy management,0
 staff friendly,1
 not 4 star very dated decor desperately needs redecorating our apartment we booked was not available so we were given a room not real coffee at breakfast and not offered a pot of tea not n,0
 upgraded our room went out of their way to quickly check us in the restaurant was a pleasant surprise very good food and service ,1
 we were able to be moved immediately after asking after our shower broke and maintence had to be called however due to the inconvenience we were moved to the executive suite which was amazing staff were so kind i would definitely stay there again d staff also left a lovely surprise for my other half a birthday which was so kind ,1
 staff were very helpful ,1
 when i checked in to my room there was a bottle of prosecco in an ice bucket a bottle of water and a fruit basket along with a letter addressed to another guest i called down to reception to let them know so that the other guest wouldn t be disappointed when the items were not in his room and was told that these are for a special guest and we will come and remove them immediately this is not how i expect a 5 hotel to deal with a matter such as this i m not particularly bothered about the prosecco and fruit but the inference that other guests were special and therefore i am not was not how i wanted to start my start at the hotel true to their word someone arrived immediately and removed all the items reiterating once again that they were for a special guest i was disappointed with the room fixtures and fittings it was akin to a 3 hotel than a 5 i usually stay in the landmark the royal horseguards st martins lane the grosvenor and there is absolutely no comparison and the state of the fourth floor public areas had to be seen to be believed the carpet didn t look like it had been vacuumed for weeks with bits all over it and thick layers on dirt on some of the door architraves and skirting boards i reported both the prosecco incident and the dirty appearance of the fourth floor carpet to mr andrea the duty manager i couldn t understand what his response was in all honesty as he has a very heavy accent but it clearly wasn t a satisfactory outcome as nothing was done about anything when i left the hotel two days later the same bits were all over the carpet i was asked on checking out whether i had enjoyed my stay i replied no but i have already explained this to the duty manager and the gentleman on reception said that he would apologise to me as no one else had ,0
 the location is great you can find all what you need int that area close to the u derground the hotel is nice clean with a friendly staff ,1

 the room had no window and i did not know this while booking the pictures look ok but the hotel is a hole i didn t eat breakfast it looked not appealing at all the stuff could not find my name twice at the check in and also when a friend dropped by to pick me up i don t recommend this hotel at all there are better ones for the same price ,0

 relaxing ambience quiet location great breakfast excellent service from all of the staff ,1
 the painful experience started with charging full 3 nights gbp1000 for my business partner room despite it was cancelled more than 2 days before check in date due to emergency trip cancellation death in the family front desk instead of finding a solution to refund the unjustified room charged she put the blame on booking com and told me its there policy which doesn t make sense because booking com is an e commerce intermediary platform and they don t collect room charges for themselves that was my response then the front desk lady she promised to discuss this matter with higher management and get back to me which never happened no one even bothered to contact me about the subject very bad i felt like been fooled when i checked in my room i discovered a serious security defect in the balcony door it can t close from inside the fixed key is misplaced outside the balcony door and balcony is shared with other rooms so its an easy access from the outside of course i informed the front desk and the show started each personnel started to throw the blame on somebody else security contractors house keeping quality check it was a nightmare eventually i proposed a solution for them by removing the fixed key from outside the door which ultimately was done on different subject room service i used to leave my room very early for meetings and came back after 5 pm surprisingly my room wasn t serviced so i had to call the housekeeping to make up my room funny enough on my last day was the weekend the housekeeping came at 8 am and woke me up despite the sign of do not disturb was hanging outside my door as usual lots of apologies also the room itself is nicely designed but poorly engineered the bathroom lights switch misplaced by the entrance of the room so if you need to switch on the lights in the bathroom you have to go all the way to the opposite side of the room ,0

 size and situation of hotel services people very friendly and speaking several languagues,1
 the room was certainly one of the older un renovated rooms located which meant were woken up at 8am to the sound of building work in the room next door yes unbelievable but they put us in a room where the wall was being stripped in the room next door to our room that woke us both up at 8am the room itself was very dirty and on arriving back from a night out at 2am and getting into bed it was clear that my sheets had not been washed since the last person stayed there they smelt of dried sweat and the bed was covered with hairs unfortunately in the morning i was unable to have a shower because the shower was broken with either extremely hot water or ice cold i complained in the morning to pascal languila duty manager and i was told there was nothing that could be done and i had to write to the head office the entire experience ruined our entire break i have travelled all over the world and start in hotels and hostels in many parts of asia and have never complained about a hotel before but this is by far the worst i ve ever stayed in i have complained to the head office and have not had any response ,0

 this must be the worst hotel i have ever stayed in london i have stayed in a lot and i am at a loss why it is rated how it is our room and particularly en suite was very dirty and grimy in addition the smell of grease and fried food permeates through the whole hotel every morning leaving your clothes in need of a dry clean we couldn t even open our window due to the smell coming up from the basement kitchen don t let the photos on this website fool you as i did ,0
 everything spotlessly clean room double superior excellently equipped and fabulous breakfast with very polite attentive staff pool area lovely we stayed here as we re going to event in o2 arena and wanted to be close but would definitely stay again and travel into city centre as it was so good ,1
 staff was excellent,1
 staff always had time for us and when they printed out tickets for the tower of london for us gave us great advice to visit the crown jewels straight away as the queues build up later this proved to be the case ,1
 locatiuon very good,1
 just around the corner from the tube station comfy bed and a nice room ,1
 best value for money in a hotel in london within a walkable distance to oxford street the reception staff were excellent the boys were probably the best in uk as they handled our luggage all the way during check in checkout room is small but good ,1
 the new rooms were lovely very comfortable and great selection at breakfast,1
 cleanliness service and the staff was arrogant single room was too small could not even open the window after taking a hot shower the air of the room was terrible no ventilation at all felt suffocated ,0

 i did not have breakfast because too 16 euro llocation very clever to come and go every where,1
 the room was good with a comfortable bed and a great shower,1
 very nice bed couldn t fault it ,1
 you should not put guests in a room which has a folddown bed and try and explain that it s an upgrade because it s on the 9th floor the beds and these rooms are not consistent with the quality of offering that a hotel of this standing should be upholding an almost sleepless night terrible,0
 my boyfriend and i had a great stay i arranged the trip to celebrate his 30th birthday when we arrived the staff on reception were very welcoming and we were told we had been upgraded for free the room was immaculately cleaned and all the facilities bathroom kitchenette television lighting were great we spent most of our time out of the room and exploring london but if we had wanted to spend more time relaxing in the room then it would have been extremely comfortable to do so the location was great a very short walk from the london eye and other attractions it took us about 3 minutes to get there from the hotel and close to waterloo station which was ideal for our arrival to and departure from london i would highly recommend this hotel and we would definitely stay there again on return trips to london ,1
 found blood stain in bed duvet which is irresponsible by management team and house keeping ac not working properly and capped at 22 degrees cannot go lower which i was sweating at night location is very far from soho regent and oxfords ,0
 very good location for tube station and getting around all the sights and shows we had pre booked,1
 beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent ,1
 the hotel had a facade of scaffold and sheeting meaning the room felt dark with no view from the window the much advertised roof top bar was closed and we were not informed of any of this at the time of booking our room had a adjoining door that had no sound proofing and we could hear the guys next door clearly giggling and chatting the bar area was dark and felt dull with no atmosphere at all its such a shame for what should be a lovely looking hotel it was poor however i guess this was all mostly due to the referbishment works ,0
 everything most of alll the comfort of beds and pillows ,1
 the room was for 2 adults but had a sofa bed as we had a child with us which was ok but not very comfy the staff were excellent and very helpful they couldn t do enough for you in the way of seeing to everything you needed during checking in out and also at meal times ,1
 staffs knowledge and support,0

 breakfast excellent conveniently situated for our stay courtyard view from bedroom very quiet,1
 comfortable quiet large room superior facilities for price,1
 everything was just wonderful ,1
 the club room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light the cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room the tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years the room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter don t believe the pictures on the website the staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when i had the ordacity to complain ,0
 no hot water and lot of spider webs not clean,0
 super comfy bed and fantastic location ,1
 tiny rooms misleading room descriptions,0
 the hotel in general was beautiful but i feel i was ripped off with the service charges on top of the ridiculous prices for food and tea,1
 noisy dirty small unconfortable,0
 the entrance smelt of smoke the reception was unmanned rundown messy and dirty reception staff seemed like they had better things to do than speak to me the walls and windows were rundown and a bit grubby net curtains were grubby bathroom door was grubby house keeping was so poor that the previous guest had left some shoes in the bottom of the wardrobe and house keeping hadn t seen them no ironing facilities or hairdryer in room had to ask for them and this seemed to be an inconvenience to them the outside of the hotel was dirty and rundown bathroom was tiny like 1 5ft by 2 5ft if that if i had been staying more than one night or had been there for anything more than work i d have checked out before i checked in first impressions count for a lot and my first and last were as bad as each other ,0
 incredible small rooms even for london staff not very friendly or helpful no restaurant bar for lunch dinner room service they only serve breakfast very poor water pressure in the shower not very clean but i ve seen worst definitely not a 4 star hotel you can get much better value for your money in a lot of 3 star hotels in the city,0
 window latch was broken so window wouldn t close and air conditioner outside window kept me awake,0
 choice of breakfast comfortable beds proximity to the o2,1
 hotel is outdated beds are horrible dirty room bloodstains on curtain etc definately not a 4 star hotel ,0
 clean the service was excellent good food and i was made very welcome,1
 everything,0
 the hotel needs a revamp and a damn good clean the reception gives you a sense of gradure and then beyond that it s stuck in the 80 s with dirty worn out furniture and carpets the room was disgusting the carpet was dirty and ill fitted with peeling wall paper and the valance was stained and disgusting the toilet didn t even flush 169 wasted and the breakfast was equally awful the cooked breakfast was dripping in fat and then i asked for porridge that wasn t inc in the price and i was told i had to pay 4 20 sadly that was equally awful so i left hungry and totally disappointed why didn t i complain the staff s english wasn t t good and i didn t speak their native tongue a truly awful hotel that is masked on this web page by the posh name and location ,0
 the room was amazing it was very spacious and immaculate upon arrival the staff were very friendly and showed us where to go and advised on optional extras we thoroughly enjoyed our stay ,1
 the bathroom not clean,0
 slow service had to remind them twice to clean the room very small rooms very late ceheck in ,0

 friendly staff at check in general cleanliness and overall efficiency great location for hammersmith apollo which was a key feature of the booking breakfast good as was meal in bar ,1
 the rooms are very small and old this hotel urgently needs a refurbishment the walls seemed like they were made of cardboard i heared people talking all the time the beds were really small and uncomfortable the bathroom was completely outdated and not as clean as you would demand a hilton to be ,0
 proper 4 star hotel and relative chap price bus stop next to it and busses 9 10 will take you to the centre in no time fair distance from hammersmith metro hammersmith is very convenient station many lines intercept ,1
 i have stayed in this hotel in the past and enjoyed it i was really disappointed this time as i asked for a high floor and got a basement room with one window facing a wall under the sidewalk i understand they ran out of availability but i would expect from such a level hotel to let me know if all they have is a basement room after i requested a high floor and this room is priced like all other rooms expensive worse was the insulting approach of the lady in the reception who was trying to convinced me that this is the best room in the hotel and the man in the reception the following morning when i checked out ask me how was my stay but when i explain my agony about my stay didn t really care to listen and just said sorry to hear ,0
 continental breakfast was fantastic and the staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and problem free train station was round the corner and a small shopping centre too me and my new fianc e had an amazing stay and we will go back ,1
 lovly and helpfull staff old building renivation rooms nice and convinient rooms very good place very nice new shower good restaurants near hotel near metro clean room good bed ,1

 very small room not nice as i thought hilton group old building,0
 we were greeting at the reception by a lovely young man called vijay he made our stay at the hotel amazing he was so helpful with everything,1
 smallest room i have ever encountered we were in the building across the street our room had stairs leading down to it which was a nightmare for getting our bags in seriously couldn t swing a cat in our room bathroom was a joke my hubby is 6 4 he struggled to fit in the teeny shower staff were unhelpful unfriendly would not recommend this place ,0
 the room was smelly the noise fromthe lift kept us awake ,0
 management and staff,0
 good location kindly staff lovely clean room,1
 very helpful staff great choice of food at breakfast clean and recently refurbished close to underground station ,1
 the room was little more than a tiny box you even had to crawl up the bed to get in,0
 the service is non existent and the buckeyes trusts not work ,0
 the bedroom looked like it hadn t been updated for over 15 years carpets were shoddy and worn bath was stained very poor for a hilton hotel,0
 the staff were all particularly friendly and courteous ,1
 well situated for tube and station comfortable bed quiet room great breakfast ,1
 the room was not cleaned as well as it could have been skirting boards and light fittings need dusting too and just a regular coat of emulsion would make so much difference to what should be a lovely cosy hotel ,0
 good location v friendly staff special mention for kim who was extremely helpful and polite ,1
 very nice hotel and good location nice room and friendly staff we liked the swimmingpool and the sauna a lot the breakfast was good and we liked it very much ,1
 far too busy hughe queue at the check in counter and breakfast room absolutely outdated oldfasioned staff very friendly but almost all young interns,0
 the best location russell sqr tube station is 3 min walk clear and pretty comfortable,1
 the management charged us advance for group booking without mentioning that in the fine print ,0
 rooms not so clean and not cleaned properly daily stained carpets ,0
 early breakfast for marathon runners,1
 horrible experience first of all the reception staff did not advise us that we had to pay for swimming and the towels which is totally unfair as we are already paying for the stay second off all the swimming facilite and sauna was very dirty felt like a cheap swimming lesiure centre we told the staff we will pay extra to stay and they said okay we get to our room and it is locked we was very upset with this would never go back,0
 we were the guests of the day which was a lovely surprise and got breakfast included as well as a room on 9th floor the bed was very comfy fantastic hotel in every way ,1
 a decent 4 star hotel but it lacked some of the most basic things 1 a toilet brush 2 a minibar 3 plug adaptors were scarce 4 only one soap 5 a very cold room with a bad heater i required an extra heater to warm the room in a 4 star hotel 6 i asked for 2 single beds and i found them together that was hilarious 7 a 4 star hotel that actually offers prices without breakfast sounds more like a low cost airline ,0
 wifi didnt work in room carpet stained and wooden furniture tired chipped drawer didnt close fridge not mounted curtains didnt close properly and 2 single beds pushed together doesnt equal a double bed ,0
 the staff is good the room and bed comfortable,1
 the room wasn t ready so free drinks voucher were given and you could leave you luggage once you d checked out ,1
 staff are always joyful and helpful we were under booked totally my fault by 1 day and on site manager extended our stay in the same room for another thanks for that and also guiding us to the pick up point for our tour of highclare castle so kind of all of your staff thanks doug pat brugger ,1

 upon my arrival i was given a room without windows even though my reservation was for a one with windows 130 gbp per night after my complaint i was told that i booked a room without windows even though that was not true after all they apologized and provided a room i booked but it was very cold wasn t clean and there were moths in the towels ,0
 great location helpful polite and well trained staff although the breakfadt room melee and staff involved were a little less well organised,1
 breakfast is very poor and does not qualify for 4 hotel cleanliness of rooms is on a low level housekeeping on the daily basis is quiteis not sufficient hotel has no gym the bathrooms are quite old and shabby,0
 excellent location on a quiet street just around the corner from earl s court tube station easy acess from heathrow airport 35 minutes by underground a garden at the back adds great value on a summer s day ,1
 very noisy although we stayed at 1 we could hear everyone and everything and the room was not the one in the pictures shown on booking it was very small and crowded ,0
 toilet button broken told housekeeper at 10 00 am before leave the room to fix once came back nothing done called to front desk at 10 00 pm again to fix it the answer is yes will do went out to bar and came back 23 59 nothing done the answer was no engineer available why u guys should tell me sine in the beginning moved to another poor room with ac noisy for whole night no one care about these problems at all ,0
 no room service very small rooms no breakfast,0
 the reception staff never there had to wait for so long and when someone is there they re quite rude no smile no eye contact asked for an iron many time many occasions but never received one so i had to wear my creased clothes,0
 everything else the building is tackiy tatty and tired the inside needs full refurbishment the charge for parking was disgraceful this is the hotel parking the breakfast was very disappointing indeed ,0
 the room was very clean and comfortable ,1
 location is perfect for a short stay staff very helpful ,1
 room too small shower leaking no flexibility for check in and check out times,0
 all staff especially miles on reception were professional and friendly and the rooms were well kept lounge and bar arrears felt comfortable and relaxing ,1
 views large comfortable bed location to o2 great breakfast ,1
 friendly helpful efficient staff especially the bar restaurant workers the bellmen all went out of their way to make one feel relaxed welcome ,1
 the stay was best by not being in the hotel after spending 120 per night i expected a great deal more the hotel is not all all value for money the room was small there is absolutely no way to shower without making the bathroom totally wet there is no views from our room the staff at reception was very unhelpful for example we discovered at the end of our stay that we could have taken a river taxi from across the road staff failed to mention that when asked how to get into town just down right unhelpful which was a shame as the rest of paris helped us to enjoy our stay even staff from office units tried to assist as we walk about enjoying the city i would just never stay at the hotel again very very poor the asking is also a major issue advertised as having parking in the uk does not mean that you then pay for the parking this should be made clear at the point of booking ,0
 a completely hassle free stay staff and facilities were perfect ,1
 was allowed to check in early having spent 30 hrs travelling which was very much appreciated many many thanks ,1
 the facilities were fantastic the staff were really friendly we was upgraded upon arrival and the location view from the room was perfect,1

 room no room service no food at night,0
 toilet was dirty unfriendly staff awful breakfast which i then was charged for when i had already paid in advance for this was a stay for our wedding night,0
 the location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff hyde parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to oxford street instead of public transport the hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities ,1
 i was told breakfast started at 0630 in fact it didnt start till 0700 i was told bedroom had a window i was in basement room and it had a piece of glass in wall it wasn t a window the quality of bed linen was poor very poor synthetic duvet and ynthetic pillows ,0
 place could do with tidying up paint job there was plaster peeling off in places very expensive for what you get breakfast is great but service was lacking at times had to ask for coffee 3 times before service and that wasn t on the busy day had a conference on on one of the days but we hadn t been warned ended up queuing for breakfast not what we expected if they had said been warned we would have come down earlier or atleast wouldn t be mentioning it here car parked 1 50 an hour we parked up at a tube station for our duration and paid 5 a day unlikely to use again ,0
 the bed was comfortable the service from reception was very good the room was very clean ,1
 the personnel was really nice,1
 the location was absolutely fantastic couldn t have got better rooms were lovely and clean and lots of character within the hotel ,1
 i specifically booked a large double room for me and my wife on arrival we were told that a room with two single beds was only available i was annoyed with this a refund should be due because of the downgrade but nobody seemed to help me or knew how a refund would be processed ,0
 really old dated hotel smallest double bed ,0
 cleanliness and location were excellent ,1
 not a 4 star hotel i would say 2 maybe rooms were small and ac didnt work,0
 100m from queensway station and 250m from bayswater station renovated rooms with new wc and shower bath very comfortable beds very friendly and helpful staff ,1
 i was setting in the reception reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at 2 clock you can get the key and other giving them the key when i spoke to her she said we have categories i told her i know you have categories when first customer came i kept quite because they are 2 but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait 15 min it will reach 2 and you will get the key after 5 min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster the reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses my evidence hotel camera ,0
 we were delighted with the hotel it was exceptionally clean friendly all the staff were very friendly and helpful mario gave us a very warm welcome and gave us an upgraded room he explained everything clearly we stayed there to go to a concert at the 02 and it couldn t have been easier it made life so much easier to walk through the walkway straight into the 02 and afterwards while everyone else were rushing to catch trains etc we ambled back to our room and the view from the front over to canary wharf was wonderful and we had a side view of the dome it was a delight we had a wonderful breakfast they had everything there you could want and nothing was too much trouble ,1
 terrible l was arrive at 1 00 am and they say we havent got room they left me that time out side terrible,0
 clean comfortable and affordable centrally located with friendly staff would gladly stay there again ,1
 it didn t serve alcohol,0
 decent room great location efficient staff,1
 a hotel that s needs a lot of love and tlc you know things arent good when the tv remote control doesn t work when the water doesn t drain from the sink when a double bed is pushed against one wall so you can get out of bed the other side and when the safe is so safe you can t get to it without being either a magician or a catorcinist and guess what no mention of thomas the tank engine railway line running under my room not good not good at all ,0
 good location,1
 general standard of comfort throughout the hotel was excellent and bar prices were reasonable for a london hotel hotel was also quiet considering its size ,1
 good meals reasonable priced,1
 staff quality poor in services clinness very poor in common areas,0
 rooms at basement very small windows you can hardly get air into the room,0
 the hotel is not 4 stars fasciitis are below this standard breakfast is fair staff not co operative,0
 old furniture unprofessional staff small rooms they forced me to pay for second room as they refused to let my 6 years old son to stay with us in same room they provide free water for 1st day and when ask for the rest 6 days they refused according to their policy expensive comparing to its facility it is no recommend one for families my journey to europ was perfect except stay in this hotel,0
 helpful staff nice welcome typical of major hotel chain,1
 location location location ,1
 rude staff asking intrusive question very judgemental not very helpful charged me twice for my stay when i had booked way in advance absolutely disgraceful wouldn t ever use the hotel ever again i m very wary of using booking com again as my first experience for a special occasion was ruined room was okay for us to sleep but cleanliness of the room was very poor we found rubbish near bed and dirty crockery we asked for new crockery and the staff were not helpful rude and never brought fresh cups for us ,0
 the staff were the best kind and helpful ,1
 the club room is comfortable for 2 clean and bright the room seems to be newly furbished the toilet is spacious too ,1
 location history and architecture of building sound insulation,1
 i was upgraded fantastically to which i chose to stay an extra night views perfect cleanliness spot on ,1
 the breakfast a room service top notch great view on higher floors,1
 location very quiet street but only a stone throw away from bars and restaurants nice modern room very clean friendly and helpful reception staff who all spoke excellent english,1
 horrible maintenance closet unhinged and almost fell on me when i opened it horrible stressed out receptionist the morning shift bald guy horrible amenities nothing good about this hotel except the luck of being on rue de rivoli,0
 not hilton standard ,0
 it s run down needs to be totally refurbished and its dirty it s a disgrace maybe it was 4 10years ago but now it s 2 at best booking com should not be selling it as 4 hotel it s a disgrace to your company too if i could rate it lower i would ,0
 not safe my laptop got stolen room was not cleaner properly fridge was not working and not rectified after reporting ,0
 the hotel was lovely great location staff really helpful,1
 spacious room modern and comfortable the great breakfast efficient staff ,1
 staff is very friendly they upgrade me to have a room with more luminosity it s clean and a quiet place near by many things to stay in paris ,1
 its shambels absolutely shocking in the name of 5 star other rooms might be better but this was horrendous ,0
 the room was exactly as expected the bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was huge easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk ,1
 the neighborhood is too dangerous as a girl alone i felt constantly under threat the taxi driver told me not to go out of the hotel,0
 room clean big enough staff cool helpful they let us early check in unusual for paris hotel,1
 great staff location and rooms,1
 booking in extremely slow bar tariffs beds where like sitting on a bouncy castle really bad,0
 wifi non existent so couldn t work air conditioning only so heating through separate heaters not sufficient so very cold and boiler faulty so no hot water in the morning 15 discount not good enough so waiting on reply from gm upon checkout others also complaining about same issues ,0
 every thing,0
 room did not have a window and i booked a normal standard room completely unacceptable bathroom looked like a hospital toilet not a hotel room breakfast was tasteless and not fresh bread was even still a bit frozen mushrooms probably from cans no fresh juices also restaurant windows were extremely dirty they looked like they havent been cleaned for months ,0
 well looked after by the staff nothing was to much trouble room was good except bathroom a bit small but hey who spends all there time in the loo would deff stay again,1
 i have stayed here previously and felt it worthy a revisit the room allocation this time was clearly in the older block dark and dreary we had booked a triple room but only set up for two and we had to request extra towels and amenities numerous times i will not be staying here again ,0
 room service size of the rooms views staff not that much helpful,0
 the location is excellent midway between the west end and st paul s the hotel is in one of the inns of court so has a pleasant quiet isolation but within a few paces you are onto fleet st and the hustle and bustle of the city of london staff are very welcoming we were able to upgrade our room without any fuss and the whole team were very helpful ,1
 close to every thing in central london,1
 our stay here was excellent from the location to the staff we got the room with a view and it was absolutely amazing you could see the arc so close the pictures don t do it justice this was our first time in paris and we loved it farouk went out of the way to help us and book stuff we wanted to do around the city if it wasn t for him the stay wouldn t have been the same he was as good as the view we had would definitely recommend it ,1
 general service and compfort of room,1
 double room only big enough for a single traveller,0
 the hotel is superbly located especially if you are attending a concert at the royal albert hall as we were rooms are clean and staff very helpful the buffet breakfast is sure to satisfy all tastes ,1
 staff were very friendly great location,1
 the hotel was conveniently located between two major tube stations we were due to check for in at 2pm but they let us check in when we arrived at 11am we really only used the hotel as a base we weren t there very much so i can t comment on the facilities or breakfast but i was very satisfied with what we got for what i paid ,1
 they don t provide drinking water,0
 the air conditioning system and low water pressure,0
 single room was tiny and housekeeping never cleaned it ,0
 so close to south bank easy to walk over bridge to covent garden very quiet room nothing to much trouble for staff ,1
 parking was in plaza close buy and no lift there rooms were exceptionally small toilet and shower were seperate in small room and were very small area in room ac cooling was not good and staff could not do much about it all a c split unit needed was cleaning of filter and gas reload ,0
 everything staff the room was small and pokey i booked a double smoking room and they gave me a room on the ninth floor and when i asked about the smoking they must have given me the worst room in the hotel these was to single beds put together and it was like sleeping on a bed of rocks their was no hot water on the first and second day it was just a big disaster would not go back to the hotel if i got it for nothing ,0
 the rooms are nice with good views up high,1
 staff were miserable and un proffessional a concierge that opens doors whilst on his phone and then let s it shut on you is not a good advert rooms need updating especially the bathroom,0
 if you choose the basic room you get a pretty weak room in the basement it s not well advertised and i feel cheated ,0
 they rang me at 3 45 the day before to cancel my booking which is disgraceful and offered me no reimbursment for the costs i have incurred for this trip therefore i had to book another hotel at great expense thank you both,0
 it took 2 hrs to check in and there were a lot of discrepancies with my booking,0
 all facilities were good and wouldn t have a problem using this hotel again,1
 rooms were clean breakfast good and staff friendly ,1
 service and staff and size of room,0
 the room was lovely and so was location,1
 hotel staff not available for check in then went to my room only to find auto key card not working went back to reception and again no one there to help waited 10 minutes and given a new key card only to enter the room and someone was asleep in the room again went to reception and told them to hat had just happened after all that i thought it could not get any worse and it did rooms have paper walls u can hear your next door guests going to the bathroom talking if fact it s like they are in the room with you then to make matters worse ohh yes it gets worse the room doors don t fit correctly and they rattle when someone walks past your room or opens there room door hardly slept at all and will never use this chain of hotels again ,0
 lots of homeless and beggars outside hotel staff didn t speak good english and bar was never manned and poorly stocked sockets in room didn t work and when reported to staff were not attended to back of drawers was coming away and had nails sticking out cost of drinks was excessive even for london ,0
 room very dusty construction in room next door starting 8am airco leaks left huge puddle in the room electrical issues some lights can t be turned off bad air circulation cigarette smoke filtering through vents and windows,0
 very dirty rooms and the whole hotel smelling i was there in august the staff are trained to upset the customers the parking is very expensive the hotel is like 1 star not more,0
 the beds were amazing graham on concierge made our stay at this hotel he was extremely helpful during our stay top bloke ,1
 old style hotel charm and service very good selection for breakfast both cooked and cold easy access to tube network and hyde park ,1
 everything except the staff,0
 the air extractor in the bathroom ran all night i couldn t sleep past 06 00 the shower fittings fell apart when we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared we too had an overlong wait for breakfast ,0
 reception staff were excellent gym was well equipped for the size ,1
 rooms are old need repair it s about 10 years overdue for a renovation,0
 excellent staff well presented room with everything we could need extremely comfortable bed and furnishings sky bar provided excellent service and views ,1
 room 504 fabulous,1
 every thing is too small i had to put my luggage in my friend room as he has bigger one no copourd my cloths always wrinkeled and througn on floor i asked to move me from mine to bigger standard one and i found it the same sheet sting not worth money spend for 4 nights ,0
 suitable for family holiday 10mins walk to metro ,1
 the hotel staff were excellent and the bed was very comfortable like the idea of the portable handy phone very homely place would defo come back if slightly cheaper ,1
 the staff cleanliness and staff attitude i booked for two nights and had to walk out the second day due to nasty horrible staff liars cheats and rip off hotel not the best way to spend my anniversary booking com is also accountable for the misconception the hotel was nothing like described hardly nothing working engineer had to spend over an hour in my room trying to sort things bathroom was dusty staff couldn t speak english took over 30mins to check in fridge stunk room and corridors smelt of damp no lighting paid for an executive room and ended up with a smelly room not the size and description shown on booking com pictures didn t even match this place is a joke showed no remorse let us check out without any apologise and charged us for the full two nights please do not even bother to reply or patronise me you know exactly what you did wrong especially the part when one of you walked into our room at 7am whilst myself and my partner were undressed in bed he got a good eyeful i was wrong not to have called the police i wish j did now,0
 the wooden beams in the ceiling of the room are characteristic of the charming latin quarter architecture i will definitely come again ,1
 i was made to wait for 3 hours in reception for the police this was terrible as it was late at night i had been working all day i wasn t offered a drink i was frightened as i was a woman alone no security didn t sleep well ,0
 lots of room,1
 it was an amazing weekend i had planned a birthday surprise for my partner but the staff at the apex took it further surprising both of us at the end ,1
 no air conditioning had to sleep with my room door open all night and a noisy fan plugged it the temp in the room was 26 degrees and the room was tiny with only a small window,0
 the room was nice the breakfast buffet was good the location was great ,1
 non,0
 great location near the place de la sorbonne and very pleasant staff ,1
 very friendly and helpful staff very comfortable and quiet room ,1
 dirty,0
 the hotel is beautiful and has some stunning features xx it s quite small and our room was on the tiny side but it was cute and comfortable and i would stay again,1
 first of all the four stars given to the property is deceiving the property does not look like a 4 star hotel at all the check in and check out was not swift and took a lot of time the furniture in the room was old there was a crack in the bathroom ceiling the coridors had a smoky smell and of damp ,0
 location of hotel is fantastic particularly small kids who don t want to spend too much time walking we had a great weekend break,1
 one of the rooms we had booked had someone come in the room in the middle of the night this was appalling of a hotel given this was paid for we would not expect our privacy to be jeopardize and also this is a massive security infringement i was really disappointing with this ,0
 beautiful decor and lovely touches with free gifts ,1
 there is only one lift small lobby,0
 the veiw was outstanding the room was great and spacious staff very friendly ,1
 rooms were incredibly small and beds for anyone over 5 8 foot was a problem also i booked for two people and they charged my account even though i stated the two people were paying on departure ,0
 i would have liked to know prior to my journey what type of breakfast would be offered intercontinental or continental a kind of odour in the bath room ,0
 very unpleasant receptionist not welcoming and unwilling to deal with complain very suprised for the standard of service of 4 hotel ,0
 ideal location for the apollo we were visiting friendly staff and nice and clean,1
 hospitable nice breakfast staff great beautiful interior,1
 booked a single room by mistake and they would nt change it to a double for me or give me my money 231 down thank you very much ,0
 everything,0
 room was shabby for the price 300 no breakfast ,0
 my stay was a disaster i suggest the name of the hotel is be changed into simply crooks thieves i have to tell that my room was filthy and my experience became even worse after my stay a few hours after having checked out i realised that i forgot my electircal toothbrush in the bathroom of my room i called the hotel they said that they had not found anything in my room as i knew for sure that i did leave it in the bathroom i called back a few hours later then they said that they would check with the cleaning person again one day later i called them and they said that indeed the cleaning person had found the electrical toothbrush but had thrown it away i asked why they first said they found nothing and lateron got another anwer i did not get an explanation furthermore they said that this was something between me and the cleaning person who i don t know i even don t know whether the person is a man or a woman and that the hotel has nothing to do with it i proposed that the hotel would give my electrical toothbrush back or a compensation of 40 euro after a month i still got no answer if i try to call them they even don t pick up the phone anymore congratulations simply crooks thieves ,0
 food and the service,1
 bed was very good and staff very good,1
 food in restaurant was excellent,1
 lovely hotel and great location staff friendly service great room comfortable and clean we would definitely stay again ,1
 arrogant staff who were not at all concerned that they failed to provide the wake up call i requested which totally spoiled my morning plans,0
 massive cosy beds large showers and a lovely deep bath so clean and immaculate ,1
 spacious rooms,1
 stunning rooms fittings close to a number of attractions restaurants pubs very close to many public transport options ,1
 everything was brilliant,1
 rude reception staff dirty towels no laundrey service in hotels they take your stuff outside the hotel pooor value for money,0
 rooms were very spacious and clean get to breakfast early otherwise the queue can be long although plenty of good hot food do ask for fresh coffee though as have a habit of letting it stew on the hot plates,1
 we booked a superior double room for my mum and i wouldnt have described it as superior but it was a beautiful room bed was comfy bathroom was spotless and old building itself was just stunning breakfast was superb and well worth 12 prebooked a selection of hot food including boiled eggs pastries and toast fresh fruit yoghurt salmon cheese and ham location is just around the corner from queensway situated on the central line tube station which had a lift great for luggage ,1
 nice helpful staff,1
 fantastic hotel for concerts at the o2 only a short walk in car parking is easy and we got a discounted rate of 24 per night which though expensive is better that 50 ,1
 not very clean carpets stained dirty coffee cups dusty tiny sink bathroom most certainly needs redecorating mould on sealant and just a little shabby although the bed was comfortable room temp was too high and the regulating unit didn t work couldn t keep the window open because of noise also they charge you just to keep your luggage in the front of the hotel which i thought was a little extreme and not mentioned on the booking information overall not as nice as the pictures and could do with a facelift but for a london hotel probably one of the better ones i have stayed in i got a discounted rate on the room would not pay full price not worth it ,0
 no space at all in the triple room ,0
 another case of a let down in london this hotel does in my eyes not qualify for 4 stars the lift was broken for 3 days i was on the top floor which shows little care for customer experience the housekeeping was at best basic and rubbish was left on the floor for the 6 nights i stayed bed comfort is basic and only 2 small pillows are provided under the sheets i found several pubic hairs there is no hairdryer or iron for clothing the reception was left unattended at night at several occasions which is a security issue as anyone can walk in i also called for a wake up call without anyone answering for at least 10 minutes so this is not an occasional fault the walls are thin and housekeeping make no effort in keeping their business quiet i would pay tops 60 per night for this property,0
 resturant was very small had to wait for 30min not many options for vegetarians in breakfast will not stay with novotel in future they need to learn from welcome group or ramada group ,0
 this location is excellent for families and travel it was very easy to get on the underground as well as walk right across westminster bridge and to all the sights the food was excellent the wait staff was very attentive both for breakfast and for dinner ,1
 male night desk clerk was overtly rude distance to underground despite what was advertised was a long way to walk hotel and room decorating were absolutely laughable soap dish in bathtub was positioned to slice the bather s leg open ,0
 extremely noisy hotel you can even hear the sound of the elevator you will not be able to sleep well very warm rooms ,0
 the location was not bad but can t see view of eiffel tower even bit the maid didn t fill out the mini bar in the room we have to call reception almost everyday ,0
 i got everything i expected from that hotel,1
 upgraded when we arrived to a lovely spacious room overlooking the square reception staff were plentiful and well informed ,1
 really friendly and helpful staff and a beautiful hotel,1
 slow to refill breakfast items slow to clear tables resulting in big que to get a table no tea spoons on table ,1
 old interior reminds me of the 90s ,0
 you re always my hotel of choice you re staff are incredible and recently you ve been giving me wonderful upgrades i always recommend you and when work ask me if i have a preference of accommodation you re my first pick i ve been staying with you for years so thank you,1
 misleading photos th rooms are far too small 9by 9 is hardly a room to relax in there is no heating the day time this hotel should only be rated a 2 stra and not 4 which is misrepretations of the hotel i would not use it again ,0
 this hotel needs to be rated at it s actual worth two stars ,0
 old hotel rude staff old room bad house keeping,0
 location next to o2 fantastic,1
 location dining areas and staff all faultless,1
 room was great bathroom was immaculately clean,1
 very poor service very low level of maintenance no real manager on location devastating breakfast after 0930 am junior managers keep apologizing but not fixing stuff in 5 nights and two rooms we had to deal with unfunctional minibar unfunctional electric curtain blinking spot lilghts that freaks your mind when trying to relax or read ,0
 quirky pool great staff amazing food ,1
 the hotel is under renovation and failed to advertise that fact there were rips in the carpet smudges on the wall and dated furnishings ,0
 hard bed stained carpet in room taps wrong way round shower leaked stair case carpet badly worn,0
 absolutely rude front desk staff advertised club room with bath on arrival we were put in a standard on the special request form i put i wanted champagne in the room on arrival request ignored very unhappy that we paid so much and got nothing breakfast was cold also after paying for warm ,0
 pictures of the room on the web page look by far greater than the reality,0
 i got room with split bathroom without mention that in booking the price is higher than it deserves ,0
 great location with excellent transport links undergoing refurbishment we had a redecorated room good breakfast helpful staff great supper at the union tavern opposite ,1
 all of the above,1
 the door and windows are shaking we can hear the wind perfectly we can smell the smoke from the other rooms although the other rooms in the floor are for non smokers ,0
 our stay was terrible when we just arrived at the hotel the receptionist received us with such an i don t care attitude that we started to suspect she assigned us to a ground floor room and without asking or letting us know she sent us to a room with private bathroom with no wc door you can imagine how embarrassing that can be when you use the toilet when we realized about this obviously we asked why was that and she told us that this was the only double room available in the property on the next day she offered to switch us to a different room with a double bed so she lied about the only room with double bed in the property the other room was extremely small and in front of the bathroom door there was a dark 25 cm sticky stain in the carpet we didn t realize that it was a vomit stain until the last day unfortunately we stayed for some nights and every night when we returned to the room it was a disguisting smell we thought it was something related to the toilet given that it s an old building but unfortunately we slept and lived with that smell but that s not all the night before to the last night we heard something like a dripping water sound late in the night when we turned on the lights we saw that it was a huge amount of water falling from the upper floor maybe from a pipe over the suspended ceiling over our toilet i dressed up and went to the reception immediately to ask for help to the receptionist the answer he gave me was it s too late in the night there s no one i can call to help us please go up and tell me how much time it takes to the water to stop i asked so you were aware of that problem previously right he didn t answer as you can imagine our stay was a nightmare the morning when we left the hotel we complained about the leaking and the vomit smell and obviously asked for a compensation ,0
 everything we would highly recommend it to anyone going to london facilities great staff very accommodating and pleasant ,1
 the staff and the hotel was simply amazing full credit to every part of the team and management ,1
 i liked the friendly staff warm welcome and beautiful clean rooms,1
 often the reality is different from the website but in the case of hotel george the photos really did portray reality i could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel i chose this hotel because the average review was amazing this was spot on it s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked who could want for more ,1
 the room was so small that a person my size could not even fit i am a fairly small person and me and my luggage together was too much for this 5sqm small little space including bathroom that shower tho new was tiny and toilet seat was so close to sink that event i could hit my head the bed squezed toward to window was getting so much street noise i though i was gonna get nauseous from street pollution i can not warn you enough internet photos do not always show reality there are better places for this price i urge booking dot com to find better places or double check photo reality ratio ,0
 quiet and personable,1
 location,1
 when we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were problems with the boiler so we would have to stay in another hotel of the chain london grand paddington court we were offered a complimentary breakfast for noth days the following review is of the hotel where we ended up staying which was the london grand paddington court instead of the twin beds our room had a double everything else was as advertised good shower tea and coffee ironing facilites we did enjoy our stay but having to share a bed was an inconvience the breakfast was delicious ,1
 the rooms were so hot and we were trying to get ready and showered twice because the fan system wasn t working the beds were uncomfortable,0
 everything else i ordered room service for dinner but as soon i finish dinner i had a massive belly pain and spent a lot of time in the toilet when finally was able to sleep the fire alarm goes on believing it was a really fire going on i covered baby in a towel and left the room in a hurry surprise surprise it was not a real deal it was told to me that a guest press the fire button however had to wait until the staff let me go to the room again buy by the time i went to the room baby was already awake took me a couple of hours more to be able to put him back asleep around 4am i finally was able to go sleep in the morning i find that baby is having block nose and a nasty cough overall when i pay a hotel room i am expecting to receive a calm stay to release the stress and worries in my life did not happen with this hotel at the check out they didn t charge me the room service but i am not convinced to return ,0
 no wifi at that price really poor a bill under door for room service and a phone call to come own from my room to pay never in my life has that happ wasn t impressed we won t be back at was expensive but quite unprofessional ,0
 everything the room was at the end of a very long corridor at dressing table was a tv and not mirror i have long hair and wanted to style it the long wall mirror had no plug socket near so when i asked what can you do about this the member of staff shrugged her shoulders then decided to find me another room which had been occupied and didn t smell sweet finally got hold of an extension lead at breakfast i ordered porridge which they forgot and i had to remind them when i was finally served it it was like concrete ,0
 fantastic team and very helpful,1
 staff were extremely friendly hotel facilities were excellent ,1
 we were able to visit most places on foot but metro is only a 5 minutes walk away good breakfast in relaxed atmosphere just ask for coffee and everything else is self service fresh bread and croissants good shower pressure great burger place just opposite and tasty crepes at the top of the road ,1
 beds and rooms excellent,1
 a lot of external noise during the night including laundry machines basic room with no mini fridge or coffe machine no bathrobe and slippers for the swimming pool massage not available due to quitting masseur very small garage not included and very expensive we were given an invalide room ,0
 the bath was huge and the location was really good near the tube but outside the congestion zone with a good car park,1
 renovated room was nice and clean no noise good breakfast ,1
 we paid for a deluxe but they tried to put us into a standard room we then waited 40min for them to clean the correct room very over priced bathroom shower smelled odourous overall unsatisfactory ,0
 the staff were helpful well trained and exceedingly polite ,1
 everything,1
 location for train and the help from the concierge,1
 bright and modern comfortable rooms close to the main transport links while still seeming quiet and cosy the belgo bar restaurant is a great part of the set up ,1
 bed very comfy ,1
 the hotel staff were lovely and i loved the layout of the room also my mother called in to do something special for my birthday and the hotel staff were great about it big thank you to them ,1
 my daughter who is 5 fell in the shower and they could not do anything to accommodate how can u give a standing shower to a child unattended it s common sense and they wanted to charge for a upgrade complimentary i don t think they know how to do their job ,0
 fantastic room good gym amazing location,1
 dark room in groundfloor ,0
 the room was of decent size the bed was very comfortable and the staff accommodated to our requests ,1
 everthing,0
 staff at reception were rude and not at all helpful with my booking the room was tiny and apparently i got an upgrade no where to even open my suitcase ,0
 staff,0
 the location and the way the staff helped when we had a small problem with our room the matter was quickly resolved to our satisfaction,1
 clean comfortable room the staff were helpful and friendly the hotel is in a fantastic location i couldn t have asked for more i just wish i had been staying longer ,1
 my wife had a migraine we were allowed a late check out at 16 00h at no extra cost the staff could not have been more concerned or mor helpful ,1
 staff were friendly welcoming and attentive for a large hotel the service felt very personal good breakfast and general facilities including fitness suite room and bathroom were very clean close to public transport links ,1
 the rooms are extra small funny smell in some of the rooms and so very disappointing considering is a 4 star hotel i woudnt pay that money for that quality the pictures on the web are very smartly done is just not fair on the customers to be sold something and receive something else me and my friends booked the same hotel but after one night they switched to another they were just as disapoonted ,0
 a great place to stay ,1
 staff were very welcoming and friendly room was very comfortable loved the smart phone in the room excellent for exploring london,1
 the staff were extremely helpful they really wanted us to have the best stay possible thank you,1
 their air conditioning system was totally off,0
 lobby renovation no minibars no safe deposit boxes ,0
 the hotel and staff are just superb,1
 everything except for the concierge and the location of the hotel ,0
 the room didn t have air conditioner just a cheap fan that didn t work smelly noisy room had to keep the windows open due to the heat had to use ear plugs to sleep the carpet was tore down the closet was a joke hugely overpriced ,0
 lovely comfortable room and really helpful staff on the front desk perfect location for our visit to the globe theatre,1
 worst hotel i have ever visited very poor customer service dirty extremely overpriced there are other hotels within the area that maintain a higher standard in all areas ,0
 better care tv set a bar ,0
 location very good,1
 a grand character building with charm quality fittings and decor loved it super breakfast ,1
 breakfast not great and expensive but clean rooms nice showers,1
 general staff really don t like what they re doing wrong information about happy hour not aware when it will be finished we had to show their own poster no ventilation in toilet decoration and carpet outdated and ugly the closet cover has fallen on my foot since it was not fixed well very poor check out i wanted to see the bill when checking out the guy seemed unpleasant showed from i pad i asked print out printed unpleasantly asked me how many times had we have breakfast they don t know miscalculation was corrected by me apology is insufficient very poor laundry they are applying full charge for pressing in the laundry the delivery timing is late the room they provide for self ironing is small table and ironing device are not maintained leaking no parking availibility no bell boy,0
 floors are creaky and annoying especially if you have neighbors who pace above you all night hotel is not sound proof and water pressure is terrible elevators are like a death trap owners really need to invest in some renovations the exterior of the building is beautiful ,0
 the atmosphere,1
 windows to room looked into ground floor lobby entrance and so had to have the curtains blinds closed all the time the spa closed at 8pm i arrived 7pm expected better quality considering price it was ok but i d go elsewhere next time ,0
 excellent check in process and restaurant,1
 the location was so convenient and it s quite we were upgraded to a lovely clean spacious room with a very comfy bed and pillows the staff were all friendly and professional from the reception raquel and clara concierge wilfredo and restaurant staff especially lina we can highly recommend apex temple hotel ,1
 excellent staff helpful and friendly all facilities were clean and tidy,1

 bed comfort,1
 everything is very expensive in the hotel the price for the room is too high long queues during check in the facilities in the room are really old cleaning of rooms inadequate ,0
 room was very very small,0
 the room was very small and cramped the bed very uncomfortable and pushed up against the wall this room should be single only a dirty plate with left over breakfast there on lay outside our room from check in till the next afternoon disgusting ,0
 everything was ok nice location near luxemburg park ,1
 first room we viewed was lower ground level right by air conditioning unit for the building very noisy second room we viewed and then stayed in was narrow but comfortable however cleanliness was very questionable it was a long time since the surfaces had been dusted the two towels we were provided with were hand towels not sufficient for a grown person to use after showering staff were accommodating with our requests needs but certainly could have been more pleasant about it ,0
 no opening window and a plug socket that came away from the wall exposing bare wire was told the manager would call but nothing ,0
 great location a block away from the russell square tube station on the piccadilly line easy to access buses too british museum is a close and easy walk away euston st pancras and king s cross train stations are nearby beautiful marble y interior excellent and friendly staff everything worked well appointed bathroom ,1
 everything,0
 good location for west end theatres being refurbished and we had rooms on first floor and these had been refurbished they were very nicely decorated good bathroom facilities breakfast was good with usual choice of cooked and cereal plenty on offer we would book again ,1
 the door lock kept breaking we were stuck outside our room for an hour at 2 in the morning on one occasion bath didn t empty poor experience even down to small details such as no teabags,0
 good location adjacent to very pleasant square near underground and local restaurants ,1
 absolutely everything was perfect location staff room hotel facilities faultless,1
 the hotel is located only a 2 minute walk from earls court tube and situated on a quiet street staff are welcoming friendly and knowledgeable the hotel and room was spotless breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of both continental and english ,1
 twin room is too small for movement inconvenient for those with big and heavy luggage need to carry up the steps would expect ramp available to push roll up and down luggage ,0
 our first room lower ground 5 should not be a letting room,0
 excellent position close to many attractions on the left bank with proximity to rer and metro stations comfortable room and very friendly helpful staff ,1
 staff very friendly n helpful lovely hotel around entrance and lounge areas,1
 good sized room good transport links,1
 beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly,1
 the feel of the hotel the friendless of the staff and the location also the in room gifts unexpected and nice ,1
 location,1
 4 rooms booked were horrendous,0
 the management has bad attitude and looking for the money like a thief unfortunately they don t care about the guest condition and following their policy strictly ,0
 excellent location great value for money ,1
 rooms beds pillows staff,0
 staff were friendly our room was ready when we arrived at 12 30 pm they changed our room from a double to a twin in room dining was superb food was fab ,1
 staff not overly friendly bed very uncomfortable shower tiles dirty no complimentary water or biscuits breakfast average room service not available until 10pm do not waste your money the worst hotel we have ever stayed in ,0
 i am so appalled with what experience i had and will be calling directly booking com or the hotel to better my understanding of what has happened to me over the night at this hotel ,0
 staff treatment no drinking water shampoo is not enough for two persons,0
 very good location grand old hotel,1
 convenient location perfect for a short stay ,1
 the staff was very helpful the place was clean and tidy ,1

 wonderful architectural building a step back into victorian london ,1
 no hotel facilities price,0
 great location close to tube and lovely clean rooms ,1
 construction works starts at 8 am when they start drilling they wake you up and ur sleepless,0
 on arrival we were met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work they said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in 10 mins an hour and half later we were still waiting i asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in they agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small tv didn t have a remote to operate it either it definatley was not a four star room or experience we had to que 30 mins to get into the breakfast room when we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt they clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times worst hotel experience for us for a long time shame as we were there for my wife s birthday ,0
 wifi is not available unless paid when paid it was very weak and disconnected most of the time fire alarm was tested without any notice that there will be a test,0
 late checkout easily granted good bathroom,1
 the russell hotel was super i would definately consider it agsin for future visits,1
 location,1
 fabulous customer service,1
 service was appalling was hung up on by receptionist and duty manager dave was rude and patronising,0
 very quiet hotel lovely location,1
 we were visiting london to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and the complementary upgrade to a deluxe room was the icing on the cake thank you apex x,1
 there are many restaurants and markets nearby staff is really kind and helpfull if you have a baby and stroller choosing bus 69 instead of metro is easier to travel around ,1
 small room uncomfortable bed rundown bathroom ,0
 we booked a deluxe king with a river view and we got a basement double room with no view because they were full the room was freezing and the heating and hot water didn t work inside the bath was patched up with mastic filling 2 holes and when we complained all we got was sorry but we are full we booked 9 weeks ago and would u like a free coffee ,0
 night staff were rude and completely incompetent after being unable to search on the system he eventually found the reservation and then told me it was cancelled before changing his mind he then quoted a price that was double what was booked before accepting and realising wifi didn t work and customer service was very poor an unsatisfactory experience overall ,0
 room size atrocious,0
 the room was spotless and beds and pillows megga comfy like being on a cloud the bathroom was amazing with beautiful products to use we had a swim in the lovely spotless pool the staff were lovely and so very helpful nothing was too much trouble all in all we loved our one night stay and want to go back ,1
 the shower facilities,1
 we were upgraded to a junior suite which was great as the room was a lot larger the pastries at breakfast were lovely and warm the porters and reception staff were very helpful ,1
 the proximity to the 02 was awesome perfect if you want to make a real evening of seeing a band the bar on the top floor is awesome after a gig with great views over canary wharf,1
 the bed was comfy and the use of hotel was a lovely touch for first timers in london staff at the reception very friendly and helpful ,1
 staff attitude and behaviour was absolutely disgusting after checking in we quickly checked back out due to the treatment from staff behind reception desk ,0
 great location a 2 minute walk to the o2 great view from our room out over the river beautiful room and a massive comfy bed couldn t ask for more ,1
 quite a lot staff seem fairly incompetent although pleasant messed up our booking and then stuck us in the basement in an extremely noisy room with no air conditioning the bed was two beds pushed together with a sheet over to conceal that this was the case extremely small bathroom and i was showed that the room had an outdoor area underground which was disgusting also don t be fooled by the parking seriously don t go here really tarnished a nice getaway ,0
 the room was dated impossible to sleep because of the noise from the trains tube mini bar fridge didn t work ,0
 the room was new and really clean,1
 very comfortable club room,1
 the breakfast choice was of a very good standard and plenty to choose from definitely worth the value ,1
 the location is good the lobby and reception area are very clean ,1
 the staff was extra helpful and friendly the breakfast was good and the chef made sure we got what we wanted i also like that the hotel was close to where we wanted to be ,1
 very tired and poor condition rooms and corridors ,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful loved the decor in the lobby and the bar ,1
 the location was perfect literally a 2 minute walk to the london eye and westminster bridge there was a car park that was just outside the hotel so extremely handy ,1
 refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds we had the classic twin which like most london hotels was small but adequate we suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet location is great as only a block away from the tube with the picadilly line leading direct to covent garden and the theatres ,1
 location fab bed so comfy staff very courteous friendly breakfast best i ve had in a long while,1
 quality of room free room upgrade quiet location ,1
 location location location two tube stops just a short walk away,1
 excellent staff good breakfast comfortable bed,1
 air condition not working dirty ,0
 aircon heater did not work and it was pokey desk was a joke and i was cold ,0
 fantastic hotel and service used the hotel for cycling event next day and the hotel went above and beyond with the facilities laid on for the cyclists ,1
 the russell square underground station was right around the corner this convenience allowed me to reach anywhere in the city within a few minutes ,1
 comfortable room very pleasant polite staff,1
 extremely disappointing no free internet in room and you have to pay for every device you want connected once per day the breakfast buffet was not good for example the yogurt had the consistency of water the room itself had cracked yellow water stained drywall or plaster ceiling sink didn t drain a c somewhat worked but the vent was almost plugged with dust they staff was definitely not very friendly but did their job adequately you ll survive a stay here but you aren t likely to particularly enjoy it i ve stayed at many roadside motels over the years that were cleaner nicer and a way way better value this is not a 4 star hotel experience if you arrive with the mindset that it s a place to sleep and won t be eating there won t need internet won t spend any time in your room and don t sweat small stuff like a sink that won t drain it will be okay otherwise probably try somewhere else ,0
 the service was excellent and staff very professional and very accommodating when we had to move hotels because of a burst boiler,1
 breakfast reasonable in price and good quality comfy bar good staff ,1
 i was kept awake by a green light on the ceiling and the hum of air conditioning the hotel took 50 security from my account in case of damages and said it would take 2 days to get refunded i needed that money and should not have to to wait to use my own money shocked and outraged ,0
 been before had a very good stay,1
 the staff were all fantastic,1
 the rooms very good size clean ,1
 fabulous location right by the sorbonne and a short stroll to notre dame,1
 very good breakfast and lovelly breakfast area nice receptione ,1
 rooms very clean and spacious lots of extra touches and room ready before we were due to check in which was great the breakfast choice was fantastic high quality food and staff so welcoming it was very busy but still they went out of their way to serve with a smile the speakers in the bathroom are a lovely extra surprise and enabled us to play music via bluetooth could even listen to the news in the shower view from bedroom great too quality of sleep great no noises from other doors closing or anyone walking down corridors or traffic very impressed ,1
 one of the worst hotels ever no no complementary water at the room you have to pay 17 to get one the room was last renovated maybe in the 11th century the floor was broken walls messed up unfriendly staff at the reception nothing was good,0
 bed was ridiculously comfy i wanted to take it home friendly staff just a little outside of the centre but nothing a tube ride can t fix also they gave us a free upgrade to a twin queen room ,1
 friendly and helpful staff great location ,1
 the staff were very good friendly,1
 the smell of bed sheet and bellows were very bad i used a bottle of perfume to get rid of it until now the hotel did not release my credit card,0
 hotel was in a location that was convenient to the hammersmith tube stop hotel desk staff was really great friendly helpful and informative for a european hotel the rooms were considerably modern large and comfortable ,1
 we got upgraded to the junior suite heating had broken in there however they had already put two heaters in so we didn t need to ask the reception bar staff and porter were very friendly and accommodating ,1
 room is tiny and service is bad,0
 room was to small fr deluxe double ad room was to cold heating not working,0
 great studio room with view of the eye and helpful staff spectrum bar was good for food and drink ,1
 1 on returning to the hotel just after midnight we tried to order food and drinks from the 24 hour room service menu after 3 tries each time being informed that the items we had selected were no longer available or could be ordered in with an hour s wait time we demanded to know exactly what was available and found the choice was limited to 2 each of 3 different sandwich fillings as we were very hungry we reluctantly ordered from this selection the management subsequently removed the food charge from our bill not the drinks charge but did not seem to take on board the point that the hotel could not fulfil its room service menu 2 we arrived at the hotel at 7 30 pm already late for an event we had bought expensive tickets for having suffered travel delays nonetheless the check in process was lengthy largely because the reception staff wanted to be sure that we clearly understood that for any subsequent booking we should contact the hotel directly rather than using booking com as we would be offered a discount ,0
 bathroom water kept clogging got overcharged with laundry room key card did not work properly ,0
 location is next to o2,1
 it was unbelievable to have a room of 5 square meters,0
 the hotel all of it ,0
 great location tube station around corner plenty of restaurants in nearby streets concierge staff helpful in tracking down an international courier parcel grandiose decor inside ,1
 we were given a complimentary upgrade to the top floor by a very friendly lady who checked us in all the staff we encountered were courteous welcoming i would definitely stay here again also a perfect location ,1
 pablo receptionist named pablo pablo not be as accustomed to his style of hama hotel staff has been his style cnn and deliberately is giving me a good room also the rooms are not clean the floor there is no maintenance work and severe voice rang,0
 the rooms where filthy not cleaned properly i have asthma and the dust was terrible the staff weren t friendly either,0
 loved it all best hotel and staff ever,1
 the room was very clean well equipped staff were helpful friendly ,1
 unfortunate problem in room meaning we had to move to a much smaller room but an extra day after we alerted staff no duty manager on at night ,0
 i stay every month and as always staff are very friendly polite and make you feel welcome location is fantastic 2 mins walk from queensway tube central rooms are clean and spacious compared to other central hotels food is basic but good and a great selection at the bar not too pricey either definitely recommend ,1
 a used razor was in our bathroom so it hadn t been cleaned properly,0
 price nice atmosphere,1
 almost every thing,0
 specious room bath facility very comfy service quick room service,1
 my room was dirty and i was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks white furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog my shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it on a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage i also saw insects running on the floor overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept on top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests i understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel on the last night after i complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when i was already in bed and ready to sleep ,0
 very bad experience we thing we did not like was the do not disturb sign and they still went our room the sheets were dirty and service was bad expected more from a 4 star hotel ,0
 location was really close to train station and tube good restaurants nearby staff are fabulous,1
 do not book at this property absolutely no value for money rooms were extremely small very dirty with lots of dust everywhere bathroom was disgusting cracked walls mirrors and floors and toilet with no proper flush room sizes were extremely small for 2 people less than 6sqm which is beyond human we felt like rats living there with no hygiene standard absolute catastrophe for a 4 star standard equals more like a youth hostel in a remote area ,0
 location nice room and friendly staff who were very helpful ,1
 price decor comfort location to office clean,1
 food room very very small and so much noise,0
 it s not a four star hotel for sure i was put in room without window i m clistophobic ask to change the room but they couldn t i will not go back again ,0
 upon arrival after a long flight with the family at around 22 30 very quite in the lobby not a single of the five doormen chatting inside helped us with the doors or bagages room was not to four stars expectations i e dirty walls and stained chairs coffee tea set worthy of a two star hotel unfriendly concierge employees don t seem to like their jobs nor their working place ,0
 the room was refreshed everyday from check in to check out the hotel staff were constantly professional and always helpful nothing seemed too much to ask ,1
 helpful friendly staff great location walking distance from the british museum and a short tube ride the the west end theatres ,1
 where to start the room looked as if it had not been redone in 15 years every peice of furniture massive marks looking very horrible doors for the cabinets almost falling off massive gaps between the door frames and tiles old paint left on handrails a quick scrub got it off toilet not cleaned think ammount of dirt building up inside on the sides where the cleaners are clearly only putting a brush straight down and not doing the sides toenail clippings left in the bathroom from previous guest that then stayed there for there for 4 days that s 4 lots of house keeping who missed massive nails dust everywhere run your finger along anything massive amounts of dust under the bed well that s dirt central the room paid extra to have a river they didn t lie i did get a river view over the main road through some trees we could see it 4 meters away from our room it also appeared to be a construction site which everyone failed to mention which wasn t a good view and the noise started first thing in the morning the sound proofing from the windows is very poor so being on a main road next to a construction site was not good the rooms are joining again something they failed to mention so awoken a few times by the family next to us who had a young baby that was clearly restless the days they stayed maybe because of the constant noise now this isn t the mothers fault or the baby s but the hotel should have told us it s a joining room so there will be noise or put us in a different room the bed well i ve stayed in a lot of hotels and frankly it s the worse bed i ve slept in in london house keeping i m unsure what they do apart from steal we got fresh towels nothing else done now be aware in london it is common practice to tip and leave tips for staff this should include housekeeping which i also do at end of stay ammount dependant on service ,0
 bed very comfy,1
 excellent hotel a true five star hotel we enjoyed the stay ,1
 really good service and breakfast central located ,1
 too busy too many children bad room overpriced hotel bad experience from hilton hotels ,0
 orrible room dirty they made me pay extra room cause i did a double booking for their mistake actually because they never send me a comfirmation email,0
 amazing view of london,1
 this is not even a one star hotel i do not know how the hotel has got 4 stars the hotel corridors and doors are so ugly in addition receptionists are not kind at all and not even a little smile when you visit them on the whole it s a terrible hotel that i have ever seen ,0
 room was freezing because heating was turned off for the summer sheets on the bed were torn sink in the bathroom made a very loud noise when the faucet was turned on room service wasn t very tasty ,0
 the decor the history the staff,1
 very helpful staff and great suprise to come back to soft dressing gown at night to wrap up in,1
 everything ,1
 fastastic location with easy access from greenwich station unimaginable view on every floor especially the 18th floor bar it s a place to be well trained and happy staff ,1
 extremely tiny rooms no space to walk around the bed ,0
 every single staff memeber we met were extremely friendly and attentive they made our stay very comfortable the hotel had only been opened 3 weeks and was spotless rooms were very nice ,1
 most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up,1
 very enjoyable stay here and although refurbishment in progress this had no effect whatsoever on our stay,1
 location staff cleanliness room size all beyond expectation ,1
 nice variety of foods good coffee,1
 poor room small to single beds put together to make one double kept falling down middle,0
 the staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful the rooms were clean stylish and comfortable the hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of amsterdam ,1
 overall the hotel was superb and the convenience for going to a concert at the o2 arena was second to none would recommend unreservedly and definitely use again ,1
 room was basic and dated had a leak and water came threw the ceiling staff didn t really care mouse in reception area,0
 very friendly and cooperative staff very good breakfast nice bar nice room located very closely to waterloo station big ben westminster abbey and buckingham palace,1
 hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional the room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything also had to love the apex duck would definately recommend staying in an apex hotel ,1
 staff were brilliant and nothing was too much trouble special mentions for vlad on reception and reghina in the restaurant ,1
 helpful pleasant staff,1
 cleaners they don t understand english cleaning was bad they didn t change the towel we book for 2days and in there system 1 day we had to walk all the way from 3 doors to reach the reception because they want to check the email ,0
 the check in process when booked by someone else company is ludicrous and archaic you have to use the same card to put a 50 hold on even if the room i pre paid i nor anyone from the company i work for of 8000 will stay here again ,0
 the availability of parking and easy access to the m4,1
 location,1
 staff swiped my card for payment without my consent prior to my checkout dates hotel is far from city and staff misguided on the location and proximity to city to travel with luggage unsafe area post sunset ,0
 wonderful reception staff lovely sky bar and high spec all around ,1
 poor check in services lack of orgnaization,0
 the hotel is a great boutique hotel the rooms are great and the hotel staff where helpful and friendly ,1
 issue with room a leak from above causing dripping in service cupboard staff attended straight away and moved me to another room so v happy with that ,1
 room to small it should be used as a single hardly any floor space had to climb over husband to get in and out of bed as it was against a wall no reading lamp or bedside table one side of bed not enough storage walls needed painting bathroom very small we had a shower in ours it was so small if you dropped your sponge you had to open the door to bend down and pick it up even breakfast room was small and they were very slow replenishing the cooked food,0
 the location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of amsterdam i would definitely like to stay here again i only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as a brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts i was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the english but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and i personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences but not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good i will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to amsterdam,1
 construction was going on while our stay workers started working around 10 am in the morning ,0
 room was well presented although the toilet had used toiletries,1
 staff were really helpful and polite and made us feel really welcome on arrival ,1
 the choices were as expected and served by attentive staff as the hotel was only minutes away from olympia breakfast was not rushed before a busy day ,1
 room is tiny,0
 where do we start the fact that the toilet did not work we reported this and when out for the evening to find that when we got back the toilet was still the same offered a double room check it out to find that this room on the ground floor was like a drive through with the traffic outside only room left was a twin but even this toilet was bordering on the not working the noise outside into the wee small hours didn t help so got a could of hrs sleep for 120 for the night and the lack of comfort it was a bit much it would have been nice to have been offered a discount but this was not forth comming we don t complain but we feel we have to for other customers looking at this hotel it was nice to get home for a good nights sleep ,0
 the service was excellent the breakfast was good fresh and plentiful ,1
 the interior design of the hotel is beautiful as are all the firmdale hotels really makes a stay special breakfast was also first class ,1
 we paid for an upgrade to our room and liked it very much the bed was comfortable the room well appointed and most of all it was lovely and quiet the hotel was fine though we did little in it except sleep and have breakfast the latter was fine the location of the hotel is convenient for fleet st and neighbouring areas ,1
 standard old bad bed,0
 the heating wasn t on in the room when we arrived and after telling the staff it was still cold when we came back from our night out the bed sheets were stained and there were no slippers or bathrobes as was advertised when we booked very disappointed really ,0
 the room was in the basement grim and smelled musty damp not to mention the beetle or cockroach not sure which in the bathroom the restaurant didn t exist and the room service consisted of takeout menus which you had to collect from reception ,0
 the location,0
 brilliant location right next to 02 view from standard double fantastic breakfast expensive but prepaid and was really worth it very high quality and plenty to choose from room was well insulated and quiet even though in flight path for city airport room and bed super comfortable very clean staff were very helpful this was an anniversary special night away and was really worth it we deliberately went on a night no concert on at the 02 spa pool lovely and included in room price highly recommend and we will save up to go again next year ,1
 they stated no smoking but room was obviously smoked in the staff was seen smoking out the window when we were walking down the street the shower pan poorly constructed water poured into the bathroom towels rags ripped and holes and this was the executive suite requested quiet room and was placed on the main road,0
 run down shabby and very noisy from dlr trains ,0
 excellent service from front desk mgr anna and vlad,1
 loved the design of the hotel the soaps were very nice as well en the bed was lovely ,1
 staff attitude extremely poor not all but most deposit charged on arrival in case you charge anything to the room as well as payment in full on arrival long walk to nearest train tube hair dryer supplied won t reach mirror so ladies you won t be able to dry your hair no power points within reach of the bed and no bedside clock rooms extremely dark very poor lighting ,0
 no babies with me so i didn t need what i found in the refrigerator a half empty bottle of milk and some yogurt nothing else i would have been happy if i needed a coffee stick for the next day i found one on the floor waited in vain for someone to check out the room after i called several times i had to pack and make another visit to reception to nicely ask for another room at 11 pm i got another room where was not possible to watch all the tv channels at the check out they offered me a bus ticket or a coffee seriously for free for making up the incident ,0
 basement rooms are terrible small bad location and noisy ,0
 the hotel was extremely interesting the d cor was beautiful with decorative stained glass windows and beautiful timber interiors the staff were helpful and friendly,1
 central location friendly impersonal service ,1
 was unable to sleep due to faulty air conditioning unit within the room which staff were unwilling to assist or relocate the manager only got involved upon leaving the hotel and was also was not helpful and only used my negative experience as an attempt to try and get me to pay to stay again do not stay here ,0
 i was given complementary breakfast as there was a problem with the room that i booked and had to be moved ,1
 the rooms and the breakfast and the confort,1
 location was fabulous staff very nice room to die for ,1
 we had a plug in radiator in the room as the central heating doesn t work but all through the night when the radiator got to the correct temperature it made a very loud click notse turn its self off which kept waking us up ,0
 small depressing lobby very small room that is the deluxe very old furniture no air conditioning very expensive rate for one night 400euro very deceiving to rate this hotel as 5 star hotel,0
 excellent location and comfortable hotel very pleasant staff 5 6 minutes walk to isle de la cite and about 6 7 walk to the metro plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby,1
 staff rude and did not sort things out fast room service and mark restaurant food terrible caused both me and my partner upset stomach and toilet problems overpriced food and a terrible standard check in too late and breakfast terrible,0
 check in room 50 minutes and staff were inefficient and not friendly requested a twin room on a low floor and was given one on the 4th floor they then changed it to the ground floor but this was a double on the third attempt we finally got a room the room was very small and the shower you could not close the door and stand in it so small no fan in the tiny bathroom and the whole room was so hot you could not bear to be in their too long the beds were extremely soft and uncomfortable not good for back sufferers to cap it all they pre authorised my debit card and i did not get my money credited back to my account for days even though we had paid by a different method on the day totally inefficient and poor service we would not stay again ,0
 absolutely fab hotel can t believe i was so lucky to have found it and book for our stay beautifully decorated super chic and quirky yet still comfortable close to notredame and the louvre 2 mins from the metro surrounded by nice shops and restaurants breakfast although basic was lovely and fresh perfect stay will be back thank you ,1
 room next to lift and very noisy our room was an accessible room which meant sink in bathroom too low for our comfort room clean bed comfy ,0
 nice staff lovley hotel and a great location ,1
 concept,1
 view and facilities ,1
 size of the room was just perfect for a small child with no luggage the room was impossibly tiny and hotel staff couldn t move me not as advertised by booking com and definitely not worth the rate paid no room to even use the teeny tiny desk in the corner which was a major problem because i was on a work trip the shower didn t drain the tv didn t work well would randomly turn off over and over the bed was fairly uncomfortable and even a bit unstable and rickety though they were nice the hotel staff gave me some bad information about getting a vat refund which wasted my time you can t get a vat refund for hotel bills and the concierge staff should have known that the staff also didn t seem to know if breakfast was included or not hotel was advertised as having shuttle service from airport which was false they had room service but there was nowhere to eat the meal except on the bed and no place to put the tray ,0
 the staff were lovely and friendly and the rooms were beautifuly clean and the food was delicious,1
 food was exceptional and our room was lovely the hotel is quiet at night ensuring a good nights sleep ,1
 small room bathroom is run down old crap room service food was rubbish and nearly made me vomit ,0
 great location for the o2 arena the river view rooms have a nice outlook especially at night extensive breakfast range hotel is a 10 minute stroll from the north greenwich underground station so very easy to get to there s also a pub within 10 minutes walking distance of the hotel ,1
 girl at desk was very helpful carina i think was her name changed my room twice to facilitate my needs,1
 good bed an shower great location nothing special but good ,1
 the bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet the staff were helpful and courteous the hotel was located in a quiet street and close to the tube station ,1
 1 the rooms are dirty and very dusty 2 the toilet drain stank badly and housekeeping was very slow to respond 3 the bed mattress was damaged causing me lots of back ache 4 the management is negative and not customer satisfaction oriented 5 they had to replace my kids room at 2 am because of a leak in the ac they gave us a lower grade room they didn t not replace room until we had to fight for it the bell boy asked my 12 year old daughter to put her bag on the trolley at 2am 6 lighting in the room was very poor 7 no telephone by the bed 8 the table in the bar are chipped and hurt my baby 9 the breakfast selection was very poor and rarely changed 10 the lobby is dark 11 the garbage room is just by the hotel entrance it stinks every time i pass in front of the hotel the only thing i got was back ache and sinus infection for me and my family,0
 very good location very warmful welcoming wonderful viewing room everything was perfect ,1
 very small room uncomfortable,0
 i thought that the style of the room was lovely and modern and the bed was nice and spacious and comfortable staff very friendly too ,1
 nothing,0
 the room was very small not enough place to be sitted on the table and work there is no signal or lights outside and was really difficult reached it from the main street they charged 50 for nothing still waiting they will them back to me i spent there two nights instead of fours and i mstill waiting the reimboursement of the two other nights ,0
 what a superb hotel the room we had was beautiful and we had a great view of the london eye as it was my boyfriends 30th birthday they also provided a complimentary cake everything we wanted to get to was in walking distance which meant traveling round even late at night was easy ,1
 i called a receptionist to the room at 1am because the heating was broke a member of staff came to the room and agreed it was broke who then said he would come back with some electric heaters waited til 2am tried ringing reception no answer i told the member of staff when checking out she took my details and said she would investigate and see if she could get some compensation but i still haven t heard anything back from the hotel and will never be visiting again ,0
 very comfortable stay excellent views and layout,1

 brilliant location,1
 room service,0

 staff location,1
 the heat was terrible and breakfast was cramped and not good,0
 booked an apartment given a room was promised twice that a discount would be applied still waiting carpets very threadbare room too hot and stuffy a c makes a lot of noise but to no effect ,0
 room was so narrow we couldn t get past the end of the bed without turning sideways neither of us are large it was about 14 inches or so away from the wall pictures added bed uncomfortable only one chair reading lights were spotlights above pillows carpet dirty huge step up into bathroom room boiling hot aircon noisy permanent noisy fan in bathroom breakfast tables so close together we were practically sitting on the laps of the people at adjacent tables room door did not fit properly so room was very noisy by door into lift and stairs lobby ,0
 ease of access to tube park museums etc staff all excellent ready to help style and character of hotel reception areas,1
 room stank of smoke towels could not be used because of smoke smell furniture in the room is very dated bathroom fittings are poor ,0
 the staff were efficient and friendly and the room was clean i chose the hotel based on its cleanliness rating and wasn t disappointed ,1
 lovely comfortable room had all the essentials you could think of staff friendly perfect location for a concert at the o2 ,1
 went an hour and a half early and was checked in no problems and allowed us to keep our bags there i till our train home,1
 after leaving the hotel i found out that the maid searched through all my belongings so perfectly that she stole money from wallet hidden in the middle of my clothes therefore i can not recommended this hotel because the staff does not respect principles of privacy and it is impossible searched personal belongings of hotel guests ,0
 staff didn t seem to show any real interest in solving issues or had much knowledge on process,0
 the whole hotel was absolutely wonderful wish i stayed longer amazing the rooms were beautiful just like the whole hotel ,1
 the duvet and runner along the foot of the bed were dirty they had mud on them from a previous customer ,0
 everything a boutique hotel should be well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to earls court station tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design really impressive my single room was quite small but well laid out i will go back liked it the best of 30 hotels i ve stayed in london ,1
 everything from pillows to the bed was sooooo comfy ,1
 good location especially for access to paddington station for the heathrow express also a short walk to notting hill and portobello road the night staff are lots of fun and provide great service angels overnight julian carlos claudio agnelo it being close to halloween count dracula was roaming the lobby and bar our initial room smelled of cigarette smoke in spite of it being a non smoking hotel thankfully they changed our room with no issue we had reserved a club room and were pleased to find a box of chocolates in addition to the wine and fruit bowl ,1
 food in the restrant was very nice,1
 room newly refurbished and very spacious and clean,1
 good size room,1
 clean and comfortable and the front desk was very helpful and friendly the location was very convenient walking distance to notre dame and latin quarter and great restaurants,1

 good housekeeping nice coffee service in room great concierge serge easy access to underground and buses ,1
 calm and quiet,1
 damp smelly room deposit to borrow an umbrella needs a refresh,0
 for it being located in a thriving place it was like the run down shed of a porch villa ,0
 the staff are friendly welcoming and very helpful,1
 room size noise food,0
 being charged for the mini bar when we had not used it room very basic i thought hilton would be better more like a travel lodge spider in bath on first night no toiletries available ,0
 we were charged twice for the room the springs in the bed were broken and the towels had makeup on them which for once wasn t the wife s ,0
 staff english very bad,0
 location and price ,1
 well presented room pleasant staff and good public areas enjoyed sitting outside for coffee good location as we needed to be near covent garden ,1
 excellent bed loved the swimming pool and jacuzzi and friendly staff good location and value for money on the deal i got wouldn t have wanted to pay full price though for the standard ,1

 the room was extremely well designed for its space and managed to include a nice desk with comfortable chair and an additional comfortable chair the heating worked efficiently the bathroom was nice the maid service was excellent the wifi worked very well in my room also the reception and concierge service were excellent ,1
 staff place location breakfast and beautiful room,1
 everything i m a particularly fussy traveller but the intercontinental was perfect in particular i thought this was exceptional value given its location ,1
 quiet rooms,1
 the pre authorise rules for extras such as food or bar not explained on check in,0
 quite a lot unfortunately the difference between the reception area and the bedrooms is huge i would compare the rooms to that of a travel lodge nothing wrong with that apart from you re paying three times the price had my room changed twice as there was mould on the shower and lightbulbs hanging out of their cases the executive rooms aren t any nicer they re just bigger our view in all rooms was of a brick wall my partner and i went to the carvery restaurant on the saturday night we were kindly provided with some gluten free gravy but it was incredibly salty and unfortunately ruined the meal we informed the staff and they were disinterested then on the morning of check out which isn t until 12pm the maid came into our room at 11am without giving us a chance to say that the room was occupied ,0
 i didn t like the location the room was nothing like the pictures a non smoking room that smelt of cigarettes walked in and walked straight back out ,0
 nothing,0
 cleanliness of rooms bed covers were not changed ,0
 perfect for theatre land and galleries lovely room and bathroom elemis products great cocktail in bar,1
 decor room hallways service all way below usual standards of hilton hotel brand,0
 absolutely everything it was awful,0
 the room was no more than a large broom cupboard not fit for a couple with the wardrobe and open you had to squeeze past the heating in room 418 tower block was not working the mini bar was empty the tiles round the toilet were broken i have stayed in better rooms in hotels of lesser stars it is a disgrace that hilton should offer such accommodation breakfast was chaotic to say the least no defined areas for items no replenishment of plates no tablecloth on the table we were offered and the service was very poor ,0
 facilities awful breakfast very poor,0
 could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in paris in terms of location it doesn t get any better than this if you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all arc de triomphe we did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately the rooms are large by european standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view friendly and courteous staff added to our stay a special mention of mr farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas thank you splendid etoile you truly made our stay splendid ,1
 towels so old torn and no complimentary water ,0
 brilliant location lovely staff and a beautiful room with everything you would need ,1
 location surpassed expectations very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful large window to open almost like a patio which overlooked the cool old neighborhood wonderful breeze as i laid in bed no screen but no bugs i think we had a tiny glimpse of the eiffel tower from the window the tiny elevator was actually really fun for my daughter the tub was great the staff were incredibly nice they even helped me to my uber which wasn t necessary and made sure he was taking me to the right place the proximity to the wonderful luxembourg gardens was heavenly ,1
 worst stay in my five years of business travel hotel was booked and paid for by my company for business purposes upon arrival to the hotel i was told i could not check in without the same card that paid for the room but as this was done via my organisation i did not have that card on my person the booking was in my name however and i offered my passport driving licence and alternative credit cards all of which were refused as an alternative i also had a printed document with authorisation from my company for the card use yet the receptionist still demanded to see the card itself before deciding to accuse me of identity theft because i did not have the card this debacle lasted for about half an hour before the receptionist eventually said that my company could send over a faxed copy of the card and a filled out copy of his specific credit card authorisation form with a business booking it is extremely common not to have the card used to pay for the room and usually proof of authorisation which i had or an alternative card which i had is accepted instead in my five years of travelling for business i have never experienced such a rude and accusatory service and after 200 miles of driving to get there it was not at all what i wanted to be greeted with unfortunately the story does not end there i was eventually allowed up to my room on the proviso that my company would be faxing through the information in the next hour only to then get trapped in the very small lift for several minutes before finally making it to the top floor this was not the only thing that did not appear to be functioning correctly as when i arrived in the room the window was wide open it was the middle of a frosty day in january and upon trying to close the window i realised why it was open it was broken as the latch was hanging off ,0
 room mattress water leaking the shameful behavior of one of the reception staff and the alternate manager at the time of my reservation knew what i mean ,0
 the rooms were very small and we were not informed of construction works happening directly outside our room window for a superior room the standard was poor,0
 while entrance to lobby looks amazing and classy the room itself did not match very basic i had upgraded my accommodation for 2 nights paris treat and was disappointed not even an option to make a cup of tea nothing provided at all ,0
 the value they have for their customers every member of staff went out of their way to make sure our start was perfect,1
 the room was a lot bigger for the price than hotels in paddington it was easy enough to go a few stops further on the tube to hammersmith i felt comfortable walking from the tube station which is in a handy shopping centre to the hotel 5 minute walk and it was easy to find also it is on the direct underground line for heathrow so really easy to get to and from the airport ,1
 the shower was tiny like less than 1mx1m small you couldn t move your arms to wash your hair the rooms were tiny and the breakfast was quite bad it is located in a really bad area unsafe area and is way away from the city and not close to the moulin rouge like they advertise it s a 20min cab ride away ,0
 the hotel in general rooms were very small my partner and i could hardly move in the room very claustrophobic luckily our room had windows but this did stop us feeling stuffy ,0
 bed bugs ants unfriendly staff toilet facilities in bad condition,0
 excellent cleanliness throughout hotel excellent location friendly helpful staff very comfortable bed efficient lifts in hotel ,1
 there was no water in the hotel on the second day which was a huge disappointment lack of space in room ,0
 the hotelw as good value for money with lots of added extras like flemish products ,1
 friendly respectful staff good location ,1
 the breakfast is delicious and the bed is comfortable it is very close to big ben and westminster abbey just 5 mins walk ,1
 proximity excellent,1
 very expensive for tired rooms air con did not work and dated surroundings,0
 noisy and very basic ,0
 the hotel staff was rude or didn t have a clue not a 5 star hotel needs to improved so much the 2 nights we was there was awful the swimming pool was in construction and didn t say that on there website or on booking com and urban view should state your going to look at a car park and be more clear about it too the room was not clean too and the mini bar never got replenished we used up all the milk and didn t get new milk for teas or coffees they won t take the food away until the next day if you get room service too not a 5 star hotel needs a lot of work and staff need training too ,0
 english breakfast everyday was a welcome bonus bar is not impressive but well run kudos to mariusz who looked after me ,1
 the staff were very friendly the room clean and the bar restaurant was lovely the underground parking was secure convenient and reasonably priced ,1
 we have been triated so bad by the one manager his name is sayed his origin from bangladesh he is not suppost to work for hotel industry if i could report him to the top management of marriott to remove him from the hotel i will do ,0
 lovely reception staff and we were upgraded a lovely surprise ,1
 sheets were not changed even when we put in a request with the receptionist who said she would have it seen to we had spilled coffee and would have appreciated our sheets changed but they were not its the only things that was not perfect ,0
 very good position for our needs,1
 well given it wasn t the hotel i booked i can t really say much about it despite having booked 14 days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy i was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in london hotels i realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms it happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller 180 for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that i stay in ,0
 it was close to hammersnith apollo loved the decor and the look of the public areas ,1
 very nice room good breakfast ,1
 good selection of breakfast foods helpful friendly staff perfect location for all our needs,1
 shabby old unrenovated rooms there is a minibar but it was empty because the hotel stopped providing the minibar service some time ago first time we have been to a property that claims to be a 4 hotel and has no minibar the bathroom was shabby as well lots of staff was roaming around without any particular sense of purpose ,0
 air conditioning didn t work so had to open the windows which meant the room stunk of chargrilled meat from the greek restaurant asked at reception and was told none of the ac was working as it d been turned off for winter shower head only worked on a fixed central jet and couldn t be changed to a shower type spray there was litter on the floor from a previous guest generally a bit unclean hotel reception carpet the first customer impression was awful worn out patched and loose ,0
 staff very helpful and friendly great location very modern but still very french loved it ,1
 the breakfast was lovely and the staff were very helpful,1
 everything was horrible over priced for a hotel that looks like a hotel from the 1950 s hotel was super outdated the entire hotel atmosphere is so sad the furniture was literally so old that if you would ve sat on it it could fall apart no bell man to carry out baggage so we had to do it ourselves i ve never seen a brand name hotel so horrible i would personally not recommend this hotel to anyone unless you have realllllyyyyy low standards ,0
 great location nice size clean comfortable rooms very quiet during the night so we were able to sleep helpful and pleasant staff made us feel very welcome ,1
 food recommendations were brilliant,1
 everything was perfect nothing could be faulted,1
 bad organisation personel motivation low service level 30min que to get a table for breakfast,0
 rooms were outstanding and very comfortable and fully equipped views from the skybar were excellent staff very friendly and willing to help location was perfect due to us seeing a show at the 02 very closely situated to tube station and pier for getting into more central london ,1
 had a one night stay at this hotel and have nothing but praise for this hotel be sure to get superior room that has fantastic view on arc de triomphe and enjoy your morning coffee routine or wine evenings on terrace overall room was clean and cosy and very quiet and comfortable for good night rest hotel staff was very courteous informative and helpful i ll definitely stay here again and make sure it is more then one night ,1
 8 80 per bowl of rice krispies ,0

 no heating freezing in paris when there and my room was literally freezing heating did not work at all when i alerted reception at check out their response was v poor i don t feel the cold usually btw receptionist said sometimes they turn the heating off but she didn t know and that heat not good when you sleep ,0
 well maintained victorian splendour great bar and breakfast room wide carpeted corridors large room with requested walk in shower,1
 breakfast was poor the quality of the produce was low limited choice not of a high quality the room the floor boards creaked badly i thought i was at at sea in a old fashioned ship the rooms are in need of real modernisation the shower was poor not stopped at a hotel with a tap mixer shower poor the hotel had a feel of a contractors hotel more like a hostel than a quality hotel,0
 charged twice and was a building site,0
 the room was awful bad carpet deliberately left crumbs on the carpet to see if they would hoover up the next day and it wasn t noisy next door bathroom small,0
 the hotel was in a great location really close to the metro 2 lines one of which goes straight to gare du nord the room we had was small but well laid out so that it was not a problem it was also very clean and comfy would recommend ,1
 friendly staff lovely comfortable room ,1
 location is great nespresso machine in the room plus capsule great shower good air condition excellent gym,1

 no free wi fi in the room payable wi fi is unreasonable expensive 7 00 for 24 hours very bad air conditioner in the room it is not operated very noisy outside very poor breakfast and small restaurant small towers in bathroom very bad working a tap in the bath and shower ,0
 booked 3 rooms for group of friends to catch up and discovered on arrival we had rooms on opposite sides of the road two in a basement and one in the uppermost room with no way out if there was a fire or any other incident very disappointed ,0
 nice and quiet left some equipment there and the hotel send it me back promptly amazing and thank you i d be back purely for the professionalism of the staff and the fact that even my go pro is safe in their hands ,1
 bed was so comfy,1
 we arrived to be greeted by a very grumpy receptionist who despite me assuring her i had followed all the procedures and requested a newly refurbished room as part of my booking kept barking at me that you had to pay more our friends who were also staying at the hotel followed exactly the same process paid exactly the same and got a new room we were not asked for a swipe of any card etc so then struggled to get anything in addition to the room room service was a joke we were woken at 5am by the smoke alarm and when we asked at breakfast how this had happened we got waved away by the staff as if they were trying to keep it a big secret the icing on the cake was the 3 99 my husband paid for a bottle of sparkling water from the hotel shop yes 3 99 our room didn t have any hot drink making facilities or water in the room so we needed something an absolute rip off and a horrible hotel with a dreadful approach to customer service do not waste your money i have stayed in many many hotels in london which have in some cases been cheaper but in all cases had a much better experience absolutely will not be staying there again neither will our friends,0
 the room was very nice bed was highly comfortable the staff were very friendly and didn t rush me unlike other hotels ,1
 personal i have made the reservation and paid the total money by master card on internet 2 weeks before my travel and i thought everything was ok but just because i did not had my card with me they would not give me the room they demand i pay cash and then they told me that if i choose to change to another hotel they will use my card information and take the total money from my account too much stress they have really destroyed my trip how can it be possible that they could use the card if i changed the hotel but they would not use the card when i stayed at the hotel i went to paris to shop but i could not do that because i have to pay the hotel cash and i did not have my card with me ,0
 everything from the moment we got there was first class and the staff were very polite and helpful the breakfast was lovely and there was plenty of choice the spa pool and sauna were great ,1
 my bag is stolen in the lobby uneducated security had to wait for a receptionist under an emergency no apologize no information after 2 days still waiting the details from them they try to avoid their responcibility ,0
 the hotel doesn t respect the terms and conditions described at booking com as they imposed me to pay for an extra room cause we were two adults and two young little children although my kids were under the age that is allowed to stay for free as quoted below free all children under 2 years stay free of charge for children s cots cribs free all children under 12 years stay free of charge for extra beds and that s what i did exactly i booked a room and asked for an extra bed but when arrived at the hotel the answer was sorry we can t accommodate you in one room but when i said that is as per your terms and conditions when i booked the room they told me that those condition are not applicable any more when i asked to see the responsible person he didn t want to even walk out of his office which is a very very very bad attitude from the top person of the hotel so imagine the rest of the staff although also i had a loyalty member ship with this brand of hotels also this didn t give me and advantage i would like to also request booking com to review the t c s so people wont get in a situation like the one the that i ve been through please post every word i said ,0
 chinois restaurant was the worst chinese food i have had for years the so called singapore hainanese chicken dish was awful no broth or rice included i ve lived in singapore and had much better from hawker stalls the room had condensation streaming down the insides of the windows ,0
 isaac on the front desk was very rude after already been waiting an hour they couldn t check us in because their system was down and isaac their front desk would roll his eyes like he is inconvenienced for the delay and we should wait patiently because it s not his fault do they teach pr in this hotel not the hotel you d want to check into in between a long journey ,0
 the bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed i have ever slept in i booked two rooms on the same booking but we were 4 floors apart the window in our room was broken and did not shut properly this room 735 is facing the busy street and therefore the noise level was dreadful ,0
 tiny room with a sink in the room and not in the so called bathroom the bed filled the end of the small room so don t expect to climb in from either side as you have to crawl over your partner if you want the bathroom oh and the bathroom has no soundproofing pretty embarrassing if you aren t open minded this place is fine for teenagers but not for grown ups doing business wayyy too small and cramped not even a wardrobe or iron style over substance for sure and hideously expensive for what you get i m going back to the hoxton or hilton thanks ,0
 everything specially when the reception remember me ,1
 staff attitude dirty room with very bad smell bathroom was flooding and dust was clear in its floor and toilet although i reported this to staff they refused to change our room at the beging till we found very dirty glass bottle under the sofa and we had to show them then without even saying sorry they just said they will try to change it next day by 3 pm which was not accepted by us so i left to another hotel definitely i will never stay in this hotel again and i don t recommend anyone to stay in it no value for the money you pay for ,0
 excellent location lovely surroundings spacious room and bathroom ,1
 spacious rooms excellent staff good breakfast and working wifi overall we enjoyed the stay at the great location ,1
 comfy bed good shower good food ,1
 the room was spacious comfortable and clean the bathroom was well appointed with no frills the staff were helpful ,1
 the customer service was really poor the staff seemed like they had no idea what they were doing they put me in an apartment at first when i payed for a deluxe double room which smelt and was dirty so i requested to be moved to the room i actually payed for i was not happy i do not think i will be attending hotel rafayel again,0
 i asked a week earlier for room away from dlr but didn t get it it was noisy and the window was part open by a poor dodgy diy job pipes made strange noises guests at dinner were handling the cheese no fork with the cheese knife the hotel was looking aged surprised there are rooms for smokers no free wifi ,0
 leak in the shower water from ceiling old windows blocked lack of client services from the employees 5 days and 10 pounds of reduction for the inconvenience ,0
 incredibly helpful staff,1
 good location a short walk from the london eye ,1
 i didn t like the bath cia there is no hot water and when i ask receptionist she said no one here can fix it honestly i feel sorry,0
 with the goring the best hotel in london ,1
 the level of service was excellent compared to similar hotel chains very comfortable room and very good breakfast good location for accessing london via the tube ,1
 no level of customer service worth applauding some issues reported during our stay but nothing was done about it ,0
 the rooms had been released so we were only given 6 rooms of the 8 we booked,0
 service very bad and they give us a room like a store and no water including they put a machine coffee but no water when we ask them about the water they said use the normal water from the toilet and they said all room full booked that why they give a cheaper one and the ac it was very bad when i checked in i mentioned for late check out and they said ok but next day they said i have to leave the room around 12 pm and no mention in system when i speaks to the manager she said ok until 2 pm but i received call i should leave at 12 or they will charge me and i said i talked to manager and she accepted she said no mention in system there s no good connection between the staff and i will never never back to this hotel,0
 professional staff clean better than the last 5 star meridian hotel which at stayed at in vienna in meridian vienna some one entered our room and opened the safe and took pounds dollars and kuwaiti dinars few from each on three different days a total of 3000 dollars were stolen ,1
 bad service by check in durty old room non renovated bathrooms bad breakfast,0
 the reception was unhelpful i has a visitor who was not allowed in could not even get a call to reception from room ,0
 the noise level of the hotel was terrible banging the elevator all through the night ,0

 food was outstanding and staff were very helpful and polite,1

 entrance comfort of beds not sure how it is a 4 star,0
 breakfast was awesome staff were very friendly and extremely helpful the bar restaurant was very convenient and provided great service loved the food and drinks they had to offer the bedroom and shower was nice i enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at park plaza county hall next time i m in town in terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily ,1
 like the room,1
 ideal location not far away from various london tourist attractions nice and clean rooms with amply sufficient space ,1
 dirty and tied no heating in the room,0
 not clean smelly rooms cigarette smoke towels are not changed crumped rooms,0
 everyone was so polite and helpful a real central location for the sights we walked everywhere from kensington palace to leicester square taking in bucking ham palace downing street and mire ending our night with a great meal and vibe in covent garden can t wait to go back,1
 the breakfast was not made to order really bad selection and the rooms were tiny hardly room to swing a cat and no cupboards or drawers to put things in ,0
 the room attendants attention to detail was excellent and we were impressed with the small touches like the fresh fruit the advisory notes left the tea tray with the fresh flowers etc ,1
 our original room was disgusting underground in the suite building nothing like the photos on booking com horrible dirty tiled floor sewage smells coming from the bathroom ripped curtains a big metal worktop and kitchen area that looked like something from a horror film ripped wall paper air con didn t work so room was sweltering not good for a pregnant customer i was so shocked at the standard of room we had been put in compared to what was advertised awful when i complained we were moved to a room in the main building it was tiny but at least was clean and air con worked it was decorated in the same style as advertised unlike the original room which felt like the staffs quarters although we were moved i felt it ruined our visit as we felt akward that there was no explanation or apology given so we felt like we were not welcome i simply can not understand how that room could be used under what is being advertised on your site we felt cheated not nice when i d put a note in the booking explaining it was the last few days of our honeymoon ,0
 hotel going through major refurbishment which i wasn t made aware of when booking very noisy drilling etc started before 9 am on a sunday ,0
 good comfy bed great stay,1
 omg i don t know where to start rooms was mesrible with the cheep quality of furniture toilets so bad and dirty reality was totally different then what we saw in pictures no nesspreso machine was given no iron and no slippers no bottle of waters not recommended if hygiene is important for anyone ,0
 throw across the bottom of the bed was filthy asked for it to be changed it wasn t tv in room had only 2 channels all others no signal asked for that to be fixed at 10am next morning and at 8pm when we got back nothing had been done asked on reception for it to be sorted out had to pack everything away and move rooms at 8 30pm second room also had dirty throw on end of bed and stains down the curtains as if liquid of some sort had been thrown at them both rooms were run down grubby and no one at the hotel seems to care what the visitors think no apologies from anyone would not stay at this hotel ever again i have no idea how it is classed 4star i seriously think the tourist board need to take a look at this hotel which i can only describe as very shabby ,0
 tiny room no bedside table lights hidden behind pillow room freezing cold heater adjustment didn t work,0
 horrible smell throughout hotel musty damp ,0
 customer service is zero ,0
 very clean and hotel was in a good position,1
 location was ideal as we went to see impractical jokers in o2 arena and the bed was so comfy i wanted to take it home with me and the bathroom having separate shower and bath was a good touch ,1
 bed was tiny just about catered for two adults shower was useless couldn t get a decent temperature and the power was woeful didn t feel clean at all after bar closed way to early for a saturday 13 50 for a all u can eat breakfast which was dry and over cooked and 4 for a bottle of water over 30 for a disgusting breakfast typical over priced london i suppose you have better facilities and comfort at a travelodge at over half the price and a damn better breakfast ,0
 the location was excellent for the four days we were there close to many attractions the staff were very attentive to all our needs didn t want to leave ,1
 the oldest of the building staff where warm and welcoming ,1
 wrotten carpets in hallways leading to the rooms hotel in a general state of decrepitude ,0
 the hotel moved us to other property in other part of the town at 21 pm due to maintenance problem refused to show that the room is not re booked by other never checked if we re ok in the exile hotel didn t inform us that the problem was fixed and perhaps it s time to return to the hotel that we ordered horrible attitude ,0
 excellent location charming hotel and very friendly staff ,1
 great location,1
 modern room with all amenities of a high class hotel great location superb service and helpful staff great bathroom ,1
 the location was perfect and very convenient to queensway tube stop the staff were very friendly and helpful beautiful decor in main areas the room was clean and well maintained during my stay the bed was really comfortable ,1
 shower equipment is not so good ,0
 conditioner was not cool did not abide by the same selected room was giving me an agreement in booking far from all the tourist places,0
 the room was very dirty there were stains on the sheet and on the headboard of the bed it was very uncomfortable and cold very bad value for money ,0
 everything ,1
 everything except the location how does booking com appraise this hotel with 4 starts you are deceiving your costumers this hotel deserve 2 starts at max if you would like to try living in a cave then welcome to this hotel the rooms are extremely small the price is very high very poor treatment from the staff very noisy and dirty honestly this was the only bad part of my visit to london ,0
 the hotel was undertaking a renovation in the bar and restaurant we were asked to move three times during our lunch so that the builders could do their work i wouldn t have minded that but my lunch a sandwich was poor and made with cheap white bread the place smelt of paint then the staff had a staff meeting and i got the whole training experience i asked to move to a quieter spot as my colleague and i had a meeting to prepare for we were told in no uncertain terms that it wasn t possible i did complain about all the disruption and again the bar man didn t really seem to care the service was slow and all of them looked like they didnt want to be there i also complained on check out and there was no real apology the staff overall weren t the friendliest and i would definitely stay elsewhere next time,0
 very welcoming staff,1
 apparently we got upgraded hate to think what your regular rooms are like ,0
 the clean room was on from 10 15 00 and again from 17 23 00 and the room was not made for the second night a janitor just walked in unannounced our card stopped working even when we paid for late check out reception called at 6 50 in the morning for no reason ,0
 check in staff were poor asked for a 50 deposit for breakages,0
 excellent location for what we needed service and staff excellent and friendly ,1
 dont think it was a superior room have stayed there before a few times and the other rooms have been much better,0
 this is a newly renovated property everything is perfect i love the hotel and decor it s very comfortable it s not luxury but it s modern i would stay again breakfast is very generous ,1
 the location is great and the russell is one of the well known historical hotels in london,1
 everything else needs an overhaul of note,0
 i liked that there were crockery cutlery a microwave in the room,1
 the staff where exceptional nothing was too much trouble and breakfast was very good value for money hot fresh with a good variety ,1
 everything the staff were not helpful the hotel was dirty none of the services of a hotel so known are convenient worst stay ever i had to go out the whole day and come back for sleep only because i couldn t stand the hotel renewing the hotel would be a good option demolishing it and rebuilding it maybe we had access to the lounge and omg the lounge the worst place ive ever been and i swear im not exaggerating we chose the hotel only because of the location and never expected it to be that bad will never ever recommend it ,0
 the room was poor and not comfortabe had the smallest tv ever duvet was wafer thin as were the pillows hair dryer was hopeless no iron but did have a trouser press no help if you want to iron a blouse shower took ages to heat to a decent temp and taps were very stiff ,0
 the rooms are a desaster dunno how could uk tourism give this hotel a 4 stars rate strating from the lits to the coridor carpet to the room that all makes u feel we are in the 1970 even there is no light in the room as in the ceiling only 1 side light wanted to wear my socks had to switch on the light of my mobile to see the color the wc is since 1960 the furniture is tooooo old what a shame of being rate 4 stars i would say 2 stars is the max this hotel should be rates you see the pictures at booking com it s trick they do u sure i wouldn t recommend anyone decent to go stay there ,0
 rooms are very very small wont be stay next time,0
 the staff makes the hotel enjoyable excellent breakfast selection and very comfy beds ,1
 location,1

 everything,0
 comfortable and cozy ,1
 more then 200 there is no air conditioned very old hotel that you can smell cigarette at the room ,0
 excellent central location,1
 large room clean nice view of russell gardens beautiful hotel and bar ,1
 everything was terrible from the receptionist she was extremely rude to the curtains having holes in them the shower being dirty the towels being dirty and the bedding a bed of rocks would ve been more comfortable than that mattress the room was always far to hot no one told us how to work the air conditioner eventually figured it out on the 2nd last night,0
 location was good staff very professional lobby was lovely ,1
 brilliant welcome we won guest of the day and had a free room upgrade which was fantastic the room was excellent the receptionist was welcoming and friendly she gave us drinks vouchers as we were celebrating my husbands birthday the room was lovely the little extras were a nice touch,1
 excellent room in a good location with an extremely comfortable bed ,1
 great location,1
 excellent professionnalisme,1
 everything ,1
 the staff is very helpful,1
 me and my friend have been to many hotels but this is by far the worst experience we had during the last 24 hours of our stay one of the hotel staff members entered our room and took a bag full of gifts and souvenirs we left near to our luggage we are very organized couple and this bag couldn t have been regarded as something else unfortunately the hotel refused to take responsibility for this negligence or even tried to help us out they never bothered to answer our emails and when we called they gave excuses such as the manager is currently not here or we will respond by email we feel betrayed by this behavior lack of security and the fact that someone can walk into your room and take from your belonging in the sponsorship of the management furthermore the lack of response of the hotel is shameful and disgraceful we will not come back to this hotel and advised all our friends not to do so as well ,0
 the airco wasn t working on the paros heat it as very imcomfortable questionable if we all use it again ,0
 i asked for a quiet room but ended up in one facing the busy street the room has lots of mold in the bathroom and smelled bad ,0
 staff on checkin room was modern and very clean comfy bed free bottled water and fr e wifi ,1
 when i was looking at hotels in paris i knew my husband and i would be getting in at 9am after flying from the u s so we would be jet lagged but it was our anniversary so i wanted to make it special i paid extra at least 50 to have a room with a view and a tub arriving to the hotel i thought we must be in the wrong place because this hotel couldn t possibly have a view they later said a few rooms did but i don t see how they did upgrade us by giving us a huge room with an awkwardly attached living room and second bath that didn t flush space we absolutely didn t need when i asked why we didn t get a room with a view the desk manager seemed confused why i would care but the entire reason we booked this hotel was to enjoy champaign in the comfort of our room while enjoying the view the worst part of it all was they offered free breakfast the next morning we didn t make it to breakfast but at checkout they tried to charge me from my research you can get a much nicer hotel with better amentities for much cheaper don t splurge on the view as i did you will be disappointed ,0
 gym crowded with trainers bad water pressure in bathroom,0
 bed very comfortable ,1
 great location near louvre lot of bars in the street x large bed for paris good shower and friendly staff,1
 there was construction through the day which i can dral with however at 5 pm when i went downstairs and asked them to stop the guy was like if u don t like it leave so i did despite the fact i had one more night stay and the slick manager john promised to refund my room which i never got obviously no one even helped me with my bags i hurt my neck carrying my bags out the road with the rude staff snickering behind my back you should be ashamed marriott this is the only one in the world they should be trained with customer service and not just conventions will never stay there again nor will i stay in a marriott because of it there s lots of options out there,0
 the place was dirty and dangerous the carpet was stained dust everywhere one of the carpet steps fell off ordered two toasties arrived a hour later cold and not even toasted would not recommend to anyone,0
 the staff were very friendly and professional room was excellent even got upgraded great value for money,1
 1 good and nice staff 2 one of the best location in london 3 you have everything around you,1
 excellent reception by the manager upon our arrival upgraded our room following a room mix up and offered complimentary dinner by means of apology the concierge was also very helpful and the location of the hotel was fantastic for access to public transport on our last day the hotel kept our bags secure while we enjoyed the remainder of our time in london will most certainly be staying again ,1
 excellent value for the money staff helpful good breakfast,1
 cleaners could not do there job unable to replace drinking facilities staff are hopeless and no help at all would never stop here if they paid me ,0
 wonderful service,1
 parking is bad the apartment was dusty,0
 everything but i like the staff only,0
 incompetent staff at reception kettle in room didn t work bar does not stay open in the evening for residents so be sure if you go to a late show don t expect a drink at the hotel afterwards breakfast was average nothing special the hotel is exceptionally overpriced as is the continental breakfast delusions of grandeur and not worth the excessive prices charged there are better in the area for less money ,0
 loved location stones throw from hyde park ,1
 really comfy bed room was lovely view rubbish but very quiet so we all slept well ,1
 i liked the staff s hospitality and the room s decoration ,1
 very family friendly staff,1
 the deluxe double bedroom was tiny you couldn t swing a cat in it and the staff couldn t be bothered in making much of a change also with three people on the desk only one person could deal with any sort of complaint or room change very unprofessional and ridiculous to charge that money for the size of the room ,0
 nice and comfy bed amazing views staff and service was excellent ,1
 everything wonderful hotel superb staff great accommodation facilities dining location,1
 stayed in a terrible room no windows ,0
 rooms were very nice we had a ac issue with one room but the hotel was very responsive to take care of the issue great breakfast other than that the facility was excellent ,1

 the bed was probably the most uncomfortablist bed i have ever slept in the breakfast was ok but the tea was awful no water provided foc either ,0
 good location immaculate hotel friendly service,1

 extra comfy beds service was excellent ,1
 fantastic from check in to check out attentive staff and a lovely welcoming atmosphere absolutely loved my stay ,1
 excellent location close to both bayswater queensway tube for easy access to the city but far enough out to feel away from the hustle and bustle customer service was excellent from all the staff ,1
 rooms were quite spacious,1
 room service have specific timing not very clean there is no mini bar nor room service ,0
 the breakfast to be reviewed maybe a new menu fried eggs could be added ,1
 staff were very friendly and accommodating,1
 no bath,0
 lovely room well laid out and very well soundproofed ,1
 overall good facility great central location for shopping sightseeing dining quiet,1
 rooms are very old,0
 the bed mattress and pillows were very uncomfortable noisy patrons on the second night made the bed situation worse we left the hotel at 7 30 am the next day frankly relieved not to be spending any more time at the henry viii,0
 previous guests toiletries and food in the fridge had not been cleared dirty under bed the entrance to the hotel is kind of hidden off the main road very very noisy street through the night with no proper blinds so very bright difficulty getting a taxi as it s a suburb intermittent barely there wifi in the room impossible staircase to manoeuvre with luggage definitely not suitable for a business traveller facility not manned so no help available cleaner barely speaks english,0
 well on first arrival the first room we were shown was a cupboard with a double bed in the basement which was far from the suite that we booked went back to reception for them to say the suite wasn t ready as it was still being cleaned this was about an hour after check in time so it should have been ready when we came back later to get ready for our night out we entered the room to find a very strong odour of paint then i found wet paint on the door the room itself a suite well im not sure how they can call it a suite as it was tiny i booked a suite as i thought it would be a nice birthday treat but it was just a disappointment there was also a hole in the front door where there once was a spy hole which means any lucky person that looked through it would see us in our room there were no bulbs in the bedside lamps the air conditioning did not work so with no windows and air conditioning the room was very hot and smelly with the paint my partner requested to use an iron to iron his shirt we were told 20 minutes an hour later he had to go back to reception to ask again we conplained to reception and got moved to a dulux double which was pretty much the same as a suite so i wouldnt waste your money on an upgrade shower toilet was exactly the same but at least this room we had space to get dressed without touching the walls after our stay i spoke with management to express my disappointment to them to be told that i would not be welcome at the hotel again ,0
 the old design of the lobby was great and nice staff,1
 we had no water available in our room upon arrival or at all we were literally put in the boiler room where it was very noisey and hot the complimentary shampoo and conditioner were hard and non existent the tv didn t work i had booked a twin room but they gave us a double bed ,0
 good location for an exhibition at olympia,1
 amazing location helpful and friendly staff very clean modern room good food,1
 the view room and staff very nice and of corse central,1
 20 minutes to check in 20 minutes to check out room had to be prepaid with 100 euros secured per day for expenses no hot water in shower in the morning no restaurant open on mondays ,0
 cost old furniture not clear noise,0
 rude staff terrible management problem with the electrics in the room meant we couldn t charge phones use kettle tv or hairdryer these issues were not dealt with appropriately by management we felt very badly treated we shan t stay here again ,0
 room is very small and old not very clean staff is not friendly and not helpful at 9 am it was very noisy because there was some renovation work going on we were not informed about it when booking or checking in tried calling reception i could barely hear them on the phone because the noise in the room was very loud they said there is nothing we can do about it ,0
 the property was beautiful we stayed right before christmas and it was just so cosy warm and beautiful inside really close to the tube so very convinient ,1
 location and kind staff,1
 such a location get a room with a view of the place de la sorbonne ,1
 proximity to tube can t be beat comfortable room ,1
 i couldn t fault this hotel it more than met my expectations in the d cor size of room position and helpfulness of staff ,1
 pokey and rundown rooms rubbish gym way too pricey for the 5 rating this hotel is 4 at best find far better value elsewhere ,0
 service levels are excellent this is a small boutique hotel so the rooms are on the small side but the level of service provided by the staff is incomparable i just love this hotel ,1
 the room was really speacious and the bed comfortable the staff was really helpful and nice and were resolving our needs fast the location of the hotel is good just 10 min walk from king s cross there is nice neighbourhood in the close vicinity of the hotel with small shops and restaurants which was quite useful everything was clean and in order ,1
 1 the room stank of marijana advertised as non smoking room 2 extensive building works are currently going on drilling wires hanging out everywhere 3 the staff are pure weird with no interest in guest satisfaction 4 the bathroom was so small that it s physically impossible to sit on the toilet due to the sink drainage piping being where your knee needs to go the staff knew about this and just laughed 5 the plumbing gargles above your head throughout the night 7 breakfast isn t included even though it says so on booking com beware recommend you avoid this place so many other hotels that are far superior ,0
 i refused the first room it was extremely poor in decoration and the carpets were worn and dirty i was shown three other rooms all the same so asked for a refund and left there in no way this is star rated correctly the only positive point is the staff were polite and accepted my complaint without question ,0
 cleanless they do not collect rubish daily very noisy rooms small rooms 10 m2 price quality not equal expensive breakfast not secure,0
 housekeeping excellent two tvs good thinking ,1
 the customer service is woful,0
 loved the bath robe,1
 bathroom furniture noise factor warmness,0
 rood was not clean someones old sock left on the floor toilet didn t flush properly air con very noisy tv had very limited channels and they didn t all work double glazing was not very effective in keeping out noise we were not greeted at breakfast a guest explained that you helped yourself and find a spare table to sit at once we found a staff member and asked for drinks i asked for a decaf coffee that turned up in a packet at our table this hotel needs to understand how to look after its paying customers on checkout we were not asked how our stay was which says it all we will not be returning ,0
 the hotel was excellent very well appointed rooms and will definitely use again,1
 when we arrived we got the information that all clubrooms were alredy occupied so we got the information that we had to wait 45 minutes when they tried to find a room for us they offered us to visit the executive lounch as if that was a favour but we had already payed for it after one hour they found a family room for us not as fancy as a clubroom but we had to pay the same price as a club room after two days it started to come water from the ceiling outside the bathroom in the afternoon they had fix it but it was still wet on the floor we got no compensation for this our impression of the staff are negativ they could have been more service minded ,0
 very clean room staff very helpful got an early check in ,1
 this is my first time to write a review 1 it is tooooooo noisy some decoration noise and construction noise freak me out until 2am in the morning i report to the hotel reception they told me they are talking and solving the problem but no staff told me they got the permission i can t believe this 2 am in the morning still have drill voice around you 2 i asked for a twin beds room they told me should pay more and upgrade i said yes and they let me to choose the level of the room when i enter the room it s not the twin beds it s king size bed room i came to talk with the hotel staff they told me no more twin beds room excuse me why don t you tell me before 3 bad flush water,0

 rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain a lot more interesting and quirky,1
 location,1
 excellent location,1
 nice clean hotel and great english breakfast ,1
 close to two tube stations circle and central lines from the hotel it is very easy to reach the main london attractions the hotel bar and dinning rooms are very nice the staff was friendly and helpful ,1
 the view was absolutely amazing very nice and cozy room perfect location at the arc de triomphe and champs elysees right in front of the metro ,1
 the girls at reception went out of their way to print off my voucher for the tour duck ride ,1
 the room on the 21 floor really smelt of sewage almost like dirty water and it was so bad it make me feel sick so i asked to be moved i would not usually complain i spoke to reception and was told that i could either go to the reception desk to collect another card or wait for the concierge to come to the room but i would have to wait a half hour for the conceriege i was very tight for time as i needed to shower and change quickly for a function this is very poor and quite unbelievable with no choice i went with all my bags to the reception i was given no apology and was moved along the corridor having taken all my bags back this room also smelt i needed to get ready and go for the function so i did not mention it for 123 this was a very poor experience not only because the room was sub standard but because the reception felt it was acceptable to tell me that i had to wait half an hour for a new room key i won t be staying again and having relayed the experience i wouldn t see my colleagues staying anymore either ,0
 they are like family perfect location everythings is perfecy ,1
 horrible old fashioned and very very overpriced,0
 room key trouble took an hour to sort out and had to change room toilet cistern did not refill after first flush ,0
 room cleaning ask twice to have our room cleaned it never happened check in made us wait over 2hrs even though we ask to check in early two ladies were very rude ,0
 staff very friendly and helpful very well located easy travel to st pancras ,1
 staff were very helpful rooms were very comfy and it was in a good location,1
 the hotel was excellent the italian restaurant in the hotel was outstanding one of the best places to eat we found anywhere in london ,1
 didn t find the kettle and tea coffee facilities until we left that morning,1
 all,1
 lovely room most helpful friendly staff and found me car parking space for the duration of my stay ,1
 location good and staff were excellent,1
 the room was big,1
 great location and very helpful staff ,1
 the check in was completely confuse and slow with a desk manages without practice the hotel gave us an awful room in the second floor basement without lift and without a daylight window there was a structure column in the middle of the room and the cleaning was poor ,0
 manuela in the breakfast room was extremely welcoming and remembered my special request for porridge each morning ,1
 staff were helpful the room was comfortable and quiet and the location was close to the museums and the british library ,1
 room 912 is a shocker we paid a premium for an executive room as it was our wedding anniversary the lift noise and a dripping water noise from the radiator kept us awake all night when we complained in the morning we were treated with utter contempt manish the so called guest relations manager was a complete disgrace keeping us waiting for 20 minutes and then taking 3 internal phone calls whilst attending to us everyone there are hundreds of hotels on booking com in london avoid this one ,0
 staff trying to get me to pay for drinks we didn t have,0
 first of all they changed our rooms to the penthouse as they had given our rooms to someone else which was in a seriously bad state of repair very rundown entrance door looked as if it had been battered shower room dirty and old baths which spat out filth when we ran a bath plaster falling from the walls no side lights besides the bed smelly old feather pillows this is supposed to be a five star hotel who in booking com gave them that level the personnel can barely understand english breakfast served in the old courtroom but in the style of a work canteen horribly expensive for such low standards final amusing comment when i asked if all the rooms were in such a bad state oh madame i believe we have one or two rooms which have been renovated ,0
 the location was fantastic,1
 service was poor and arrogant sometimes refusing to serve saying that they had already dressed tables for breakfast sometimes even aggressive our eur 500 room a night was the oldest of the building with a rotten carpet ,0
 rooms were very outdated and bathroom needed a complete revamp,0
 the breakfast the room especially the view of the garden close to earl s court station nice neighborhood ,1
 do not go to this hotel i was kept awake all night by regular rasping noises like very loud snoring coming form the bathroom i complained in the morning and was told the manager was too busy to see me even though i offered to return after breakfast he clearly did not want to face me i insisted a staff member accompany me to the room where he the handyman verified the noise was still very much happening every few seconds i filled a complaint form and left it for mr touray the manager he has never been in touch even though i e mailed him as well i did not sleep all night and the fact that they did not even say sorry or contact me is disgraceful ,0
 lovely hotel and staff,1
 i booked a single room it was tiny for a client of mine that was not very fluent in english they tried to charge breakfast that i had already paid for and also tried to change 200 for phone calls that actually were 60 i had to go personally to the reception and clarify the situation on the guest book the rates for calls was not mentioned for rest of europe only for certain european countries with an average 1 5 per minute however they claimed it was 3 per minute for europe while at their book australia is 2 5 and usa is much less ,0
 the staff is excellent they went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and comfortable highly recommend them for that they deliver a genuine feeling of old school london marvelous the location is perfect for bus underground and walking my externally booked stonehenge tour also met up at this hotel making it extremely convenient ,1
 the breakfast especially the eggs were awful the air conditioner didn t work because it was apparently only ever turned on in the summer the room was the smallest double i have ever had the misfortune to experience ,0
 vidas the concierge had his first day back at work after returning home he was very helpful in attending to hiding a cake with the cafe patisserie staff olga and her team for it to be presented to my son on the terrace later on additionally the requests i asked for when i made the booking with booking com were attended to by the hotel ie a room with a river view and other thoughtfulness made my son s 30th birthday a memorable one nuria checked us into the room very attentively my wife thought the tea served on the g f terrace was exceptional quality the champagne in the sky bar we had later on was very good ,1
 worst beds ever ,0
 don t take standard room they r not worth and without ventilation,0
 the region of jardin de luxembourg is a great location you re a bit away from the masses near the eiffel tower but there s still plenty around to do in walking distance ile de paris with the notre dame the jardin de luxembourg itself the pantheon and i could go on for a while more the hotel and our room was very clean the combination of authentic and new elements see pictures of the breakfast room vs the entrance hall worked remarkably well the staff was very kind we got upgraded to a better room with a splendid view room 56 sight of the university building and place de la sorbonne the nights were quiet the room was well equipped what more can one wish for hotel select and its room 56 are definitely a recommendation ,1
 the staff were efficient and attentive,1
 great hotel polite and friendly staff thank you,1
 breakfast was poor look warm water to make tea staff could have been more helpful,0
 very bad service overall,0
 everything not clean bed broken baby cot broken and dirty no robes or slippers no toiletries 1cup for coffe when there was 3 of us very poor for 1 night paid 215 not worth it not happy at all,0
 the bed was as hard as a rock the aircon does not work in the room even though we were non smoking smoke was coming through the vent in the bathroom shower was bad the walls are so thin you can hear the couple next door a queue for breakfast in the morning paying 4 pounds to use gym towels had marks on them i will never go back again ,0
 i ve stayed in some 500 hotels in my life this one stands out due the hospitality of the staff we felt truly welcome and it made our stay so nice ,1
 the staff on duty in the lobby and at the front desk were great ,1
 the bathroom and room were much improved on a hotel close by i have stayed in before ,1
 the unfriendly staff at reception ,0
 constant noise all night from air con even when switched off and noise from elevators on either side of our room when i asked to be moved they told me no other rooms were available didn t sleep a wink not worth 250 for the night ,0
 location reception noticed that during the stay i had my birthday and i got a little cake sweet ,1
 the breakfast was lovely the building itself very impressive concierge people was so helpful ,1
 breakfasts her lovely and hot and fresh,1
 hotel is lack lustre in its approach and parts were very dirty the restaurant and bar areas were filthy and the breakfast room reeked of old fat i could not eat there at all and in fact on one of the days bought my evening meal at the local tescos,0
 breakfast is fantastic staff is friendly and very helpful ,1
 staff where very helpful and nothing was to much to ask very pleased,1
 front desk were kind and helpful location is amazing sitting on hyde park 50 meters from the metro station would definitely return,1
 besides the lobby the rooms and corridor need a real refurbishment including new carpet the carpets are absolutely disgusting and the bathroom is in a really bad shape ,0
 complimentary wine chocolates and bathroom products,1
 rude and unhelpful staff ,0
 the fact that i had booked this hotel as a single female traveller for 3 nights due to it being directly across from gloucester rd tube station all confirmed to arrive and find that there was no room available meaning i was moved to the fulham road hotel this was 3 tube stops further away from the city and as i was not comfortable walking the 5 minutes from the tube to the hotel at night had to spend more money on taxis ,0
 lovely hotel friendly staff,1
 family studio was excellent set up for couples with young kids,1
 after travelling from the far north of scotland we decided to stay at this hotel for ease to attend a concert it was a great find ,1
 the location was fantastic and we upgraded so had an amazing view of big be and the london eye the seperated space for the sofa bed was great so that my husband and i didn t have to go to sleep when our 5 year needed too the housekeeping staff left a little note and a fun size mars bar for each of my little boys toys cause they looked hungry i love little personal touches like that ,1
 the hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic the room and bed were extremely comfortable excellent personalised service food was excellent ,1
 the staff was unconcerned to the extent rude and not even wanting to listen and was argumentative type we had booked for 3 persons in a room and they charged over and above the rate we had paid and didn t listen to our submissions that we have already booked for 3 persons and paid at the time of booking and were not willing to listen and solve problem and no manager was willing to come and talk and they really overcharged us there were no greetings by any staff member to any resident at any time and they showed a non concerned approach except for the location there is nothing good in the hotel and next time we are not going to try any mercure hotel any where in the world,0
 too much noise especially the public address system of the train station,0
 tuff staff,0
 there were bugs in the room and the shower did not have a privacy wall or curtain ,0
 builders on the roof outside my bedroom window from 8am,0
 room unheated upon arrival heating not functioning properly i got a flu impersonal service no breakfast room available ,0
 wonderful choice of breakfast beautiful frontage and reception area ,1
 we loved the buffet breakfast and that the staff was so quick to provide us with breakfast bags when we left the hotel to go on tours very quick responses to opening the windows and unlocking door when we inadvertently left key in room also appreciated setting up taxi to go to airport ,1
 the staff member who checked us in was fantastic his name was miles and he was so lovely helped us enormously and scored us some cake for the room a winner in my book even free glasses of wine as our room was not ready at the stated time ,1
 the staff were extremely helpful and friendly very accommodating for us being out at unsociable hours and holding our luggage whilst we were out after check out,1
 location service facilities wifi was very weak very dark corridors room door was banging,0
 horrible rooms old deteriorated dirty and bad room service worst value for money i ever encountered in a supposedly 4 star hotel where we were paying almost 500 per night breakfast not included if it was the only hotel in paris with available rooms i wood not stay there again ,0
 comfy bed accessible shower as disabled very clean all staff were very kind and helpful ,1
 this hotel is dirty,0
 noisy rooms small poor breakfast wouldn t stay again,0
 the room was so luxurious very comfy bed and modern decor hotel had character ,1
 fantastic location for visiting the appollo theatre 5 min walk and very handy for hammersmith tube station ,1
 the room was tiny with only 1 light by the door and one in the bathroom making the room even smaller darker and very dull on top of this 3 of the lamps did not work the bed was uncomfortable unclean and creaky even the slightest movement turning round to get comfy made a tremendous amount of noise i checked under the wooden bed and the legs were cracked and split the description of what was included in the double deluxe room did not reflect on what we were given the staff were awfully rude with the exception of one or two people the waiters waitresses in the bar seemed to ignore our table but wait on some others as usual users of hilton hotels through leasure and business we did not expect what we had come to and i doubt we will ever use a hilton again definitely not worth the money extremely disappointed ,0
 facilities,0
 dirty couches,0
 staff were really helpful and friendly ever such good value for money top tip would be book direct as same price only breakfast is included although they upgraded us to free breakfast rooms small but clean and comfortable ,1
 car park spaces were ridiculously small scratched our 16 plate mercedes due to one of your staff misguiding us in 20 for car park over night which is shocking breakfast was vile and everything was hard and cold ladies toilets were in the basement 2 floors from reception and was like a building site health and safety oh and only 8 spaces in the car park,0
 internet facilities and staff,0
 everything was nice air condition breakfast good bed quality separated shower and toilet on the room and beautiful design of hotel and room ,1
 during my stay my grand mother 85 years old she was ill and we had a phone from our country and heard that she is in a very bad situation so we changed our airplane and we kindly would like to ask the reception and we would like to talk with the manager that could we make one day early check in we were 8 person and 3 rooms because booking com customer relation talked us to speak with the manager i am 38 years old and i travel all over the world belive me i have never seen such a bad and rude staff in my life yes i also know that the room is not returnable but because of customer respect we do it in our country the manager should come and talk with the customer even the hotel manager oblige to talk with us and never come her his room is 1 meter to the reception people shouldnt forget that you should respect the customer because we are the one who pay your salary the rooms are very very small even in paris and very dark view no sun is coming to the room additionally a bad smell is coming from the toilets and never lost they are telling that the breakfast is buffet it is something joke there is only egg and cheese that is all for breakfast the lady in front of the desk has glasses and i think she is in 50 s she is the rudest people i have ever seen she should be the only reason that not to stay in this hotel if you are visiting paris with your children or older persons and can not use metro subway i dont suggest you to stay here because it is far away to every important attractions neither in the booking comments it writes it is very close to the city center and good location it is not true for example because of my small children 3 and 8 years we all have to use the taxis and the closeses touristic area is something 15 euro with taxi such as concorde square 15 euro louve musuem 25 euro ,0
 everything from the moment we arrived was first class and all the staff were very welcoming and helpful also amazing views from both the rooms and bars ,1
 nice room and decent evening dinner ,1
 small room no room to move ,0
 good food and friendly service always there to offer advice,1
 i had seen the propertys availability on booking and since i have had positive experiences in spa hotels i was looking forward to it unlike most 4 hotels there was no real welcome eventually a young woman asked me what i wanted i said to make a reservation for two nights without consulting any kind of file she announced nous sommes complete i looked back at the page i had opened where the hotels availability was still plain to see at that moment i should have left already the hotel had displayed poor customer service eternal optimist i booked it on line and cheerily announced that i had done so rather than apologizing or offering me a coffee while they put the situation to rights they turned away from me and fumbled with their computers after a while a shabby room was ready no charm rather bare soulless room i thought never mind i ll go and relax in the spa only to hear that the hammam was out of order again with scarcely an apology so all that was available was a chlorine filled swimming pool i must admit they did carry my case to my room but when i left obviously struggling towards them to make check out and claim back the 50euros they suspiciously demanded from me as guarantee there was no offer to help me with my luggage not when there was no longer the possibility of more money they drop the customer i told a man that i was disappointed and he announced mechanically that he was sincerely sorry and blamed it all on the young woman who had dealt with it rather than offering any kind of compensation or making a personal gesture to show that the customer is valuable to them maybe they could have offered me breakfast which they were selling for 19euros i had glanced at the breakfast and like everything else it looked shoddy and rather vulgar the only nice thing was the little courtyard and maybe its proximity to the louvre ,0
 the hotel itself is a three star at best broken facilities in room air con window wouldn t lock leaking shower sagging floor broken community facilities sauna was out if order and steam room appeared to not work no pool or even spa really don t understand where the five star rating comes from as the place is a dive,0
 massive bed great shower and bath helpful staff attractive decor quiet location despite being very central ,1
 the service was amazing ,1
 small cramped room on top floor hot room even whith ac running bathroom tiny no where to place your things as shelf was broken shower was not draining properly so had to stand in ankle deep water when showering room very hard to get to with bags not recommend at all value for money very pore ,0
 the bed was comfortable there was enough light in the room to work often hotel lighting is not suitable the room was well equipped and a good size for london,1
 they threw away my overnight bag no apology or admission had to go and but new toiletries don t leave anything in your room ,0
 location and staff,1
 i love the water pressure in the shower it was sublime,1
 rooms food service everything is just terrible i wanted to cancel from the first instance i checked in but the booking com did not help nor the property management,0
 ideal for visiting 02 arena,1
 bed far to small the room stank,0
 we had a cot but cot didn t fit in room was moved but rooms far to small not suitable for my needs ,0
 everything,0
 public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt its an old building and clearly has old building issues ,1
 most horrible hotel they gave me a room on 3rd floor with no lift i have to climb 3 floors and rooms were available on ground 1st floor and 2nd floor and i requested them so much they didn t agree to give the room on lover floor the rooms are so tiny you cant even move your self i will never recommend any one for this hotel not at all worth for money ,0
 this hotel was very nice a great location near westminster bridge for city access the breakfast was very good a bonus was the free laundry for guests which was great after 2 weeks on the road the concierge was very friendly helpful as were the baggage guys on the front door ,1
 having to find my room using the torch on my phone,0
 dirty bed sheets too disgusting shocked to take photos ,0
 beautiful interior,1
 food very good,1
 good room layout ,1
 they offered us an upgrade which i paid for as it was my 65th birthday and i thought my wife would like it there but rather than an improvement the the room was the worst ive had there and i have stayed a good number of times the bathroom was in a shocking state the main air conditioning unit was right out side the window so we couldn t have the window open all in all as great disappointment ,0
 excellent location staff friends and attentive,1
 internet didn t work 3 flights of stairs would be hard if older person ,0
 very pleasant hotel excellent staff good very quiet location 200 yds to earls court tube station ,1
 unusable wi fi i could not even connect i complained and i was told i could use the business option at 15 day broken window charred bacon minuscule room ,0
 great location rooms were of a very high standard not what i was expecting for a holiday inn definitely will come again ,1
 staff and proximity to tubr,1
 my room was badly in need of renovation repeated water damage had left the walls dirty damaged bathroom very badly designed so floor flooded with every short shower requiring all available towels to dry it so no possibility to be more eco friendly it was just unacceptable,0
 even though our room was at the basement the room was open and spacious enough for two people it wasn t an incovenience at all we were given complimentary drinks for the room key incident ,1
 room very small bed is uncomfortable,0
 the size was too small and description was totally not like i got at the site the price was double compared to nearby hotels and the water bottles were only free for the first day so better to book only one night loool,0
 the staffs attitude it was 35 degrees during our stay and we checked into our very small room that had no air conditioner the staff treated us like we should have expected this because it s not listed as a hotel feature on the website when checking into a nice hotel we do not expect to walk into a room with 3 fans on a stand generating more heat in the small room staff the man at the front desk had attitude which made the experience that much worse we checked out after the first night,0
 1 the room the carpet is about to come off the cabinet door cannot be opened fully because the bed was blocking it so the drawers could not even be opened 2 the creaky ceilings it was so loud on the very first night of my 15 nights every time the guests in the room above mine walked my ceiling would creak so loudly i reported this to reception when i got back from class the next day they said let me check the guests in that room just checked out to which i replied i m staying for 15 nights you can t assure me that you won t have guests check into that room can you to which he smugly replied we can t transfer you now you can try tomorrow morning if we have an available room no apology and since i was taking short courses my entire stay i didn t have time to unpack and repack to move rooms it was horrible every single night 3 the unaccommodating staff aside from what i said in number 2 i left a denim shopping bag in the room along with some other things i m willing to let go of and on the day i checked out i called them to say i m coming back for it when i get picked up by airport transport they said they ll check but when i went back the concierge just said dismissively that there s nothing i insisted that they have someone check and so he took a binder and said housekeeping reports all items left behind here and there s nothing in your room i can understand if they just don t keep things left behind but they could say it politely like they actually care because i paid 95 gbp per night for 15 nights 4 the pathetic service they have old carpet on the narrow corridors leading to the rooms it s so difficult to pull luggage on it and when i was led to my room i wasn t even offered help with my 2 pieces of luggage which i was clearly having difficulty with despite them being rimowa with 4 wheels 5 the lack of linens ,0
 breakfast selection was good nice room and free upgrade to a studio apartment room ,1
 messed up on one of our reservations we had a confirmation from them with the nights but they did not in their system they told us that they were full and could do nothing to help one of our group members had to rush to find another hotel and pay a premium for it we found out later that they were not full when we looked online they took no responsibility and the customer service was awful rooms are not as pictured some are closet sized and terribly old they downgraded us and did nothing about it customer service was awful downgraded us and then pretended like they didn t and did nothing to fix rude staff after that no amenities no room service no helpful concierge the only good thing about this hotel was it s location but there are plenty of better hotels in that area and much more worth the money we will be making sure our company does not use this hotel anymore ,0
 bad guest service ,0
 excellent location ,1
 dirty and smelly towels everything is very old ,0

 lovely clean and spacious room,1
 every thing room far to small stairs into room very steep and dangerous couldn t get the cupboard as bed was right there window didn t open,0
 i requested a smoking room from november as i stood here for 4 days for my surprise when we arrived did not get it and i had to pay around 200 gbp more to have one to don t mention they did not accept euros to pay the stay so i had to use my debt card when we went up to our room ac was not working reported 3 times and finally they realised ac was just blowing cold air then the day after they moved us to a junior sweet fair enough good room with finally ac working when i done the move in date evening i realised i forgot my glasses in the previous room asked for it of course nothing happened no answer given finally the day before we left i gave it a last try and asked the manager and for my surprise he found it still in the room that hk had already cleaned so i m sorry but i won t go there again and of course won t recommend it ,0
 location was great very near to a tube station and close to hyde park ,1
 location there are many restaurants to our taste ,1
 we booked a triple room and ended up in small double room with kids bed in corner for 300 i think this was totally rubbish ,0
 the room and bed size was not according to value of money,0
 hotel were unable to find booking on arrival leading to check in taking 20 minutes to be told we had received a complimentary upgrade was quite frankly insulting having stayed in a number of hotels including hilton hotels i am very aware that this was nothing more than the basic room i am more than happy to stay in the room type i have booked but do not appreciate being lied to over a complimentary upgrade sealant around the window in room has come away and was causing noise pollution into the room in an already noisy room due to the business of the road outside of the hotel not only did this cause the room to be much louder but also caused the cold to come into the room we asked to change room due to this but would told the hotel was fully booked and offered no other assistance and no effort made to resolve our complaint we re disturbed in the morning by housekeeping despite having do not disturb sign on door housekeeper had said the paperwork showed the room as empty this was still 2 hours before check out was due would also note that this hotel is not well located for activities in central london eg museums and west end we should ve researched this better overall not a pleasent or relaxing stay ,0
 the building itself is amazing the service and the staff were excellent helpful and engaging ,1
 lots of ladies entering the hotel at random hours of the night and visiting various rooms i guess they must have been looking for something they lost ,0
 very friendly nice welcome clean very helpful all you need,1
 the room was clean and tidy the staff were friendly and helpful excellent location for our stay and really impressive interior ,1
 my bed wasn t made till 9 30pm and that is after i chased them twice housekeeping is non existent with this kind of service not a word of apology when checking out and i am a gold loyalty card holder ,0
 location and the staff are very good breakfast ok,1
 poor breakfast far distance from the subway underground no on ground transportation to the airport except very expensive taxi,0
 horrible hotel the rooms are just above a major train line which operates every few minutes even during the night i couldn t sleep at all breakfast was just embarrassing there were just some bread and sausages with no pastry fruits or yogurt staff was not helpful or nice at all they didn t let me replace a room even though there were empty rooms ,0
 noise from construction toilet very small bed uncomfortable room was old,0
 the history of the hotel ,1
 great location and nice bar area lovely city views from bedroom,1
 staff very unfriendly and unhelpful beds old and uncomfortable,0
 far away from anything,0
 i did not quite realise the location was in the red light area but when a day later after i booked in march i tried to change i was refused my fault for not realising booking com regs but 3 months in advance after only 1 day booked i felt unfair parking was 93 for 2 nights so beware the rooms were set as a madames boudoir and a little on the shabby side fortunately my 3 sons aged 21 14 saw the funny side beds comfortable enough and rooms cool staff english speaking and friendly ,0
 the check in experience was extremely bad they canacled my booking without notifying me and they didn t offer me a matching room replacement the have offered me a higher room with higher price the lady in the reception was so rude and she told me this is what we have take it or leave it i have been forced to pay a higher amount as i arrived from long flight around 7 30am although i have booked the night before i will not trust booking com again and will never use hiltion hotels again,0
 the hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on oosterpark which is awesome the location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to poi convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city you can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins very clean room made and towels changed everyday almost perfect ,1
 this hotel is currently undergoing a major refurbishment and should be avoided while this is underway the air conditioning had been switched off in my room and although a fan was supplied the room was stuffy and it was difficult to sleep i had to use a service elevator which was still being used for food deliveries etc the front of the building is covered in scaffolding which must raise security and privacy concerns while the refurbishment is under way much better idea to stay in the ambassadors opposite or premier inn round the corner ,0
 rooms are old and need refurbishment sheets smelled funny and had an industrial smell not worth the price you pay,0
 great location good value for money,1
 staff were excellent location good i would return great view from room stayed in room 412 on the 2nd and 3rd july 2016,1
 everything architecture location cleabliness the bar the room was ecellent and cosy ,1
 the location ,1
 very noisy pipes so we struggled to sleep at night you could hear the people in the next rooms conversations very clearly through the vents unhelpful staff who gave very poor advice about getting around paris ,0
 the whole hotel very poor will not return,0
 excellent breakfast good choice quality comfortable bed friendly staff pleasant atmosphere ,1
 once through check in which took forever got to our room and it looked like the furniture had been rescued from the 60 s the carpet was thread bare and dirty maid still in room cleaning then we were disturbed twice again first it was to bring 2 bottles of water and 1x glass then an hour or so later someone came in to check the mini bar the seating at breakfast was disgusting it was old worn and torn ,0
 taking long time for checking in,0
 extremely dirty,0
 they upgraded us to the penthouse ,1
 the staff were super friendly and helpful the location and the room was amazing,1
 lovely spacious elegant room worth upgrading for ,1
 the location was perfect we stayed on a saturday and it was quiet but lovely the rooms were big lovely walk in shower clean no noise from other rooms staff all very friendly and helpful,1
 great location clean friendly staff value for money ,1
 room service was a joke nothing on the menu was actually deliverd to the room sent food back 3 times ,0
 great location,1
 cleanliness position of the room on the basement dirty bed sheet,0
 checked in they gave me the key once i went to the room i went to bathroom two minutes later there was a knock on my door three staff members saying i need to leave when i asked why they said we don t need a reason to ask anyone to leave i did nothing wrong i was in my room for 5 minutes maximum it seemed they were treating me like i did something wrong or discriminating this overall interpreted my event for the day as i had to change hotel last minute and now thinking of doing an official complaint towards the staff as it was out of order ,0
 location cleanliness staff quite,1
 we asked for a room on higher floor via booking com but upon check in were given a ground floor immediately called and inquired on a top floor room staff brought our luggage upstairs and waited to see if we were pleased with the room location is on point and convenient to get around ,1
 the staff and location of this hotel were great the hotel is located very conveniently near the arc de triomphe and the entrance to the metro underground it was very easy to access my office at la defence all the resturants and shopping as well as all the tourist sites and it also had a great view from the balcony ,1
 the room was small but spotless the beds were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned and restocked with towels tea and biscuits daily fresh flowers and fruit on arrival were a lovely touch the continental breakfast was outstanding lots of variety and the food was delicious ,1
 lack of cleanliness everytime someone uses water it sounds like the building is falling the fire alarm sounded several times during the stay,0
 on arrival staff asked how i booked the room and seemed disappointed by me using booking com suggested that i use their site instead and rather insisted on that to an annoying extent also i felt uncomfortable as i had to give 10 pounds in advance so in case i did any phone calls using the room line the cost would be covered by that amount i really don t understand why i had to do that since i wasn t planning to do any extra costs and if so i could easily pay for that on departure on the top of that the room was ridiculously small so the photos of it are definitely misleading not to mention that it was on the first floor with a view of the inner walls although i chose a room in the upper floors when i booked there are also other funny stuff going on like for example the toilet seat wasn t even customised on the toilet i would definitely not go back or recommend anyone staying there ,0
 greeted with a tour of the hotel extremely friendly staff ,1
 old run down just nog the luxury facility they pretentie to be,0
 the room not clean bathroom door didn t lock 4 5 flies in the room not comfortable at all also it was an anniversary treat for the weekend not happy at all i have stayed at double tree before in nottingham where excellent rooms and great service dock lands was a let down ,0
 i ve stayed for a night saturday the 23rd of july i booked through booking com and on the websites states room with view i ve called in advance to have a arranged a small cake and an happy anniversary message in my room and i did state that i would come for a late check in on booking and i confirmed the booking the day before arrival on arrival we are sent to a room with no view and no happy anniversary message in my room the night was already ruined the receptionist offered us a cold or hot beverage to convince us to accept the room and stating that there were no room available with view i refused and he called the manager after 20 min wait the manager showed up and suddenly there was a room available however the room was half the size and the air conditioning was not working and there was a only a side view of the promised view on the websites so the room was super hot and we had to keep opening and closing the room to keep the right temperature the manager promised a bottle of prosecco i waited about an hour for the bottle and i had to go downstairs at the bar and pick it up myself dreadful in addition no one was answering the phone at reception so i couldn t really ask for anything so i ve managed to start my already ruined night at about 2 o clock at night i m addition there were only two hand towel in the room so i had to go downstairs and again cause no one was answering the phone and ask for them the receptionist arrived later with towels still wrapped in the delivery bag and with an annoyed face he gave to me i got surprised he didn t threw them in my face so i will definitely not trust anymore hilton chain as i ve been let down greatly and ruined my anniversary with my wife ,0
 the electricity turned off i was unable to take a shower i would need like a refund ,0
 excellent staff and accommodation stay marred by inefficient air con and noisy plumbing ,1
 didn t worth that much amount ,0
 some of staff was bad behavior especially man i think who s name like shahid husain i couldn t saved his name actually but he impolite and rude on the other hand the manager of the hotel he accepted customers requests as soon as possible the breakfast was very poor not like other hotels there are several kinds of food added to that the coffee and tea was could i asked to change it about 3 times and some added to that the milk which inside the room was ugly and bad smell ,0
 the location of this hotel was perfect for what we wanted right in central paris and convenient for taking the train to and from the airport the hotel was lovely smartly decorated and very clean and comfortable ,1
 this property had no lift and the room was small,0
 helpful and friendly staff and the hotel is child friendly they gave my child a gift bag with some colors and toys and they had a program for children on the weekend ,1
 staff attitude not good rooms dirty linen old i was on an event no facilities for toilets in the floor with s big event,0
 friendly helpful staff ,1
 fire door broken nails on floor as no one cleared it up rubbish under bed,0
 comfortable,1
 all staff were so attentive ,1
 the rooms had very bad smell,0
 proximity to the tube beautiful exterior and architecture very friendly staff nice big bathroom in our room good neighborhood for dining ,1
 the hotel is very tired and needs a make over the y also tried to charge me again for a room i had already paid for ,0
 on arrival the main door had a sign saying please use side door so we did and the lift was not working and there were no stairs we tried the intercom to reception it did not work we spent about 30 mins trying to contact someone no replies eventually a man another customer said try the front door again it was working a while ago which we did and it was open we trudged up two flights of stairs with luggage and found a small reception in the middle of building works we should have been told about the building works when we booked i said to the receptionist the lift and intercom from outside the side enterence is not working he said ok he then booked us in and the cheek of it we had already paid and he asked for 10 deposit i gave him a 10 note he said your room is 303 another 3 flights up i said no lift he just grimmest no offer to help with our luggage not happy the room was small and pokey the bathroom was the size of my wardrobe at home very small indeed the room temperature was extremely hot so we opened a window and the street noise was unbearable breakfast was a joke the fresh fruit was a cereal bowl of chopped apple that had gone brown a limited supply of pastries and when some were brought out the were gone within seconds on leaving we checked out the receptionist did not give us our 10 deposit back i asked for it and he said sorry forgot about that forgot he was trying to pull a fast one and hope we left without asking for it we were very disappointed with our stay at this hote probably the worst we have ever stayed at ,0
 we didn t stay there as our rooms had been sold on for a higher price we were moved to another hotel not impressed although the manager was good the room we were given didn t not match what i had booked ,0
 location location location the hotel is nicely done with nice bathrooms and lovely furniture and there was 100 clean and neat everywhere this is not always standard in paris ,1
 the breakfast service is bad i had to change into room service for breakfast due to early departure but the room service just cancelled the order they said it s written on the breakfast order card that no hot food would be served before 6am so they just didn t deliver the breakfast until very last minute after i asked about it so i looked at the photo i took about the breakfast order card ya sorry i am a nerd and take photo record of a lot of things and no where was written about no hot food is served in any period of time it s just a bad experience in addition to the room that might need refurnished the location is alright not perfect ,0
 exceptional service friendly and helpful we arrived from the airport much earlier than the expected check in time but the staff member was very accommodating and allowed us to check in very much appreciated after a long haul flight ,1
 run down hotel room chipped mirror approximative furniture tiny uncomfortable double bed a shower unable to keep its temperature and walls so thin that you could listen to your neighbour s tv unluckily mine kept his on all night and a totally disorganized staff wake up call at 6am that i never requested and they presented me with a bill which was not mine not only did it take time to rectify all this but not even an apology ,0
 the hotel was very far away from the centre which was not really well indicated on the site it takes you 1 hour at least to get into town the service of the hotel was ok not great there is no mini bar in the rooms so even a bottle of water is not available the rooms are a long way from the main bar the furniture in the rooms especially the chairs were worn out at the bar we asked for crisps but that was not available only drinks the quality of the breakfast is very poor it is a massa production eggs and bacon were cooked long time in advance no fresh orange juice and the croissants were no good at all ,0
 the bathroom,0
 i got a single room first which was like a box room it was the smallest room i ve ever seen there should be a law about not being able to rent out such small rooms my suitcase took up most the floor space kept tripping over it window opened into some pipes i saw some animal walking around in the corner of my eye think it was a mouse but not sure had to ask to change this room as it was seriously unneceptable next room same size just looked bigger because of the layout it was a bit better but still tiny funny smell in both rooms some staff members grumpy and cold not uk standard place ,0
 i didnt like they didnt change the sheet bed until i told them and they make the check in to the room at 5 oclock since i should unter the room at 2 and didnt say anything but when i do my check out they didnt give me late check out becouse i have alate flight,0
 friendly staff,1
 in floor one especially room number 107 it is very noisy and couldn t sleep at night because of the continuous noises coming from the service lifts one of the managers and some of the reception staff are very rude and impolite and i can add more details in this regard if you want ,0
 awful experience from start to finish despite being very expensive for what was offered the staff were unable to help when it became clear my original booking was messed up i had to have someone else sort it out online rooms are very small completely soleless and clincal a good portrayal of the death room from the movie soylent green the room access card needed for virtually everything stopped working and i became stuck in a lift for 20 minutes resulting in my being late for an important event no apology received just uniniterested hosts i think they re called alarms went off at 02 25 in the morning due to someone having a shower and the place had to be evacuated a complete lack of information or staff on hand to aid those who needed it didn t help there was no guidance nothing on re admittance the vagrants were allowed in as well and spent 30 minutes harrassing tired and already irritated guests for money there was no one to remove them perhaps due to the almost complete absence of staff the format for this hotel is a victory of marketing and glitz over substance don t be fooled by the colourful busy exterior or friendly welcoming website page it s anything but that regrettably the rating indicator doesn t offer anything more damning that a frowning face otherwise i would have clicked that i really was disgusted with the whole experience apparently we are advised the sister hotel in paris has been completely remodelled following similar client experiences caveat emptor ,0
 centrally siuated,1
 very relaxing and treated as equals,1
 very comfortable bed ,1
 super location for o2 really attentive staff especially vijay the concierge sky bar on 18th floor was good for a nightcap and views over the thames breakfast was fantastic so much variety ,1
 i love this hotel we have stayed 4 times now and have enjoyed every stay the staff are welcoming and friendly and it is good value for money very central i have stayed in many london hotels in the past and this is my favourite,1
 quiet clean comfortable and spacious rooms ordered food to the room said about 20 minutes but food came sooner the price of food excellent considerng the portion size,1
 the room was tired and in need of updating breakfast was poor with only one member of staff attending where food and plates ran out no handsoap in the room and at 239 per night excluding breakfast it was poor value for money ,0
 all the rest,0
 the location was great breakfast was great,1
 good location along the fleet street and in the temle and i like the atmosphere of this hotel ,1
 horribly rude staff the bed is so small that i had to stay still ,0
 history of hotel and location,1
 everything especially expensive,0
 we had a triple room booked we were given a fold out bed which was not fit for purpose it was a small fold out bed which was not long enough to accommodate an average height person and once you laid on it your bottom nearly touched the floor i would not accept this at a bed and breakfast never mind a four star hotel it took me an hour and 50 minutes to sort this out which made me miss an event i was due to attend early afternoon i am still chasing them up as i requested a reduction in room rate however they said they needed to speak to booking com on monday so i would have to pay full rate and they would then consider a refund after speaking to yourselves i asked that the manager call me on monday to discuss the awful experience and they did not call me i had to call them and they said they are still reviewing and don t know when they can come back to me i insisted i be given a date by which they call me back so they agreed to end of day wednesday 25th in addition to the bed the room was very tired broken handles on bedside cabinet and stained wall lights as well as air conditioning vents in the ceiling caked with dust i would urge you to inspect this property as it really does not come up to standard it was not stated in the booking com website that the third bed may be a pull out camp bed which is what they are now claiming as of yesterday however when i complained on arrival they said that they were fully booked and that was all they could offer the communal corridors are over heated and feel like a sauna ,0
 the bed and bathroom furniture not nice didn t like it,0
 false advertising on hotel part the hotel and room i was assigned to was totally different from what was advertised the hotel staff only informed me that my room will not be at shaftesbury but at another hotel a few blocks down after i have made my payment for the 3 nights i could not back out at that point in time very sly and totally not professional booking com shouldnt allow such establishments to advertise there as a consumer i felt totally cheated and the room was very narrow that i could not even open my luggage properly otherwise room was clean a very bad first booking with booking com certainly not worth the money i paid for ,0
 attentive very friendly staff perfect location for us,1
 worst hotel l ve been stayed,0
 i had a refurbished room and it was perfect i got room service everyone was amazingly friendly the best hotel service i ve had very good value for money the food was lush the room was very clean and comfortable and modern and even though there was works happening in the hotel there was very little disruption,1
 great hotel with great staff bar was expensive but the bar staff small touches and facilities great the choice and quality of the breakfast buffet was up there with more expensive hotels thoroughly enjoyable stay ,1
 next to the hotel there is an empty building for many years which is absolutely disgusting and all the dust and horrible smell comes to the hotel rooms i am pretty sure they are rats everywhere and i don t understand how this hotel is rated with 4 stars and best western agrees to give their franchise to such a horrible hotel they have the ventilation on 24 7 to absorb the bad smell with the result of creating massive noise during the day and night ,0
 the location was excellent we had the great good luck of being upgraded to a large room overlooking place de la sorbonne even though the street had traffic during the day the windows and air conditioning were spectacularly effective in making the room quiet from this location we walked easily to sites the pantheon jardin de luxembourg musee cluny and just wandered around the small streets of the latin quarter we could not have been more pleased with the location the hotel and especially the desk staff ,1
 everything,1
 the staff were wonderful ,1
 being charged 6 for 20 minutes in the car park what an absolute rip off i will never stay at this hotel ever again when i raised this with reception they did absolutely nothing and just stared at me blankly the room thermostat was stuck at 30 degrees so when i rang reception to ask for a fan and for the locked windows to be opened i was told repeatedly that they were dealing with it but nothing happened at all i checked in just before 6pm and even by 8am the following morning the thermostat had only moved to 25 degrees poor poor quality of service and lack of respect from staff avoid ,0
 far from 4 stars standard,0
 clean good staff everything worked,1
 rooms not adequately cleaned sheets too small for the mattresses room very small do not allow suitcases to be opened if not onto the bed rotten wood into the bathroom door frame shower spilling water from hose,0
 super clean quiet hotel in very convinient location lovely staff fantastic breakfast,1
 the room was very small and incredibly noisy located near a lift i heard every person coming going from the lift the pillows were also incredibly large and not very comfortable ,0
 hotel location is excellent near two tube stations and kensington park staff were very friendly and helpful glad to see that they had a nice bar within the hotel for a nightcap ,1
 terrible room view of wall small tired ,0
 poor or broken facilities dinner non existent tv broken and no effort to be mended during our stay breakfast definitely not worth the extra 10 00 charge food and service not the service expected from an aa 4 star rated hotel i would definitely not recommend this hotel ,0
 excellent location near kensington gardens for a lovely walk and interesting places to visit bus and tube very close to explore the city restaurants pubs shops nearby the hotel is a lovely building full of fascinating history and ornate decoration good facilities and all the staff very helpful wide choice to suit everyone for breakfast and a lovely afternoon tea in the beautiful dining room ,1
 the room seemed poorly kept the carpet was dirty and stained the fan in the bathroom was on all night there was no way to turn it off it was really loud even with the door closed which made it difficult to get any sleep ,0
 yes the croissants were excellent ideally situated to explore the left bank and also not too far to musee d rsay and the louvre nice little restaurants close by and area was good for lots of walking am planning to stay here again staff all spoke very good english and were very pleasant and helpful ,1
 rooms were tiny we were given a room in the back ground floor of the hotel and told it was an upgrade it had one open room for the bathroom which was for customers with disabilities we had paid for a king bed and this room only had a double after complaining we were given the room we had originally booked very disappointed in our experience and we paid well over 300 pounds for our room not good value for money at all ,0
 the staff were very friendly and helpful the 18 th floor sky bar is a must especially on night time view is stunning breakfast was beautiful plenty selection and fresh hotel and rooms themselves fantastic,1
 awful service staff under extreme pressure bad booking system hotel locking system failed in room door repeatedly,0
 the a c not working well and the bathroom to dirty,0
 almost everything noise elevator was out of service and you have to carry your luggage for 5 stories staff was not cooperative and the price is extremely high,0
 the place was filthy despite me paying an extra 20 to upgrade to an executive suite only 2 teabags no coffee and 2 milk bathroom floor filthy bed was falling apart whole room dated and stank of smoke,0
 location staff and facilities in the room,1
 rooms and beds are to small staff is not service minded we mentioned that on the confirmation of the booking from booking com the rooms where bigger and had two windows the staff said that this was impossible all the club rooms are the same they said we only could get an other room with an additional payment we where with six and payed already in february than we expect more service with the same staff we never go back ,0
 the room they gave me was an oven wifi slow and tricky breakfast was poor close to nothingness ,0
 no safe in the room room facing train station reception personal with bad english,0
 it was complete waist my money this is not a hilton hotel from any angel ,0
 none,0
 poor sized single beds so small i couldn t spread my arms out and had rolled off the bed twice the air conditioning fans were loud and you could hear traffic all night i m not one for complaining but this is by far one of the worst hotels i ve stayed in for a while,0
 oh dear we arrived early during the day and from the way we were received and welcomed i thought this was going to be an amazing stay unfortunately i would be sorely disappointed the service i received from the night staff was the worst i have ever seen and received and for the last 18 months i spent at the very least 5 to 10 days a month in a hotel i thought i seen it all first night having requested before my arrival foam bedding through hilton honors my wife s allergic feather down as silver status member i am apparently entitled to this but alas i didn t find any i tried to call and left the phone on speaker for a good 15 minutes before i hung up i tried another number that they made available apparently this number was supposed to make your stay better and no answer again then i had to trek five floors down through a maze of rooms on the ground floor you have to see how poor the floor layout is to appreciate the strain and when i finally got to reception guy told me they never answer their phones on weekends because the phones are serviced he also told me it would be impossible to get any foam bedding because he could not leave the front desk because pointing at the queues of people behind me i returned my wife removed all the bedding and we were prepared to sleep on a naked bed when bless his soul he managed to give us one paltry foam pillow the next day when i went downstairs and reported the lack of foam bedding maria was amazing she apologised for the inconveniences and assured that the matter would be resolved without any hassle and she kept her promise i thought ok perhaps dude from the night before had a bad day hey i worked in customer services for many years in many ways as a government official i still do so i know you cant always have your a game on when it comes to customers i forgave him and doubletree ,0
 very friendly and efficient staff convenient location good rooms and public areas,1
 the room was very small and very basic the toilet and shower were squashed into a tiny space the bedroom was very small for even a family of 3 with no ironing facilities for 200 a night i would have expected a bigger room with better facilities it was probably on par with a travel lodge this was a surprise for my wife for our wedding anniversary and it was a total let down 4 stars 3 too many ,0
 staff were lovely and welcoming rooms were so comfortable and had everything you need and more i wish i could have stayed longer and will definitely book again ,1

 everything it is very very nice hotel so when they start cleaning you will never be able to sleep rooms are very small that if you are a bit fat you can t fit into the toilet it is one of the worst hotels i stayed in the only positive thing is the location on oxford street and close to marble arch and bond stations ,0
 the price is too high for an old hotel with small rooms,0
 the cushions were particularly comfortable and beautifully arranged on the bed perfect for jumping and or building a small fort the shower was a very good size our neighbours even joined us we managed to fit all 4 without any bruises ,1
 do not stay here bed bugs in our first room totally disorganised hotel breakfast run out and they would not even restock bread coffee in room we stayed 4 nights and was provided with 2 bags of freeze dried coffee the first night after that it was 3 5 euro per bag the whole hotel is a building site ,0
 really convenient location,1
 big rooms n complentery drinks in the room,1
 not re stocked mini bar smelly small room and old hotel not cleaned very well a bad hostel with a brand name,0
 we upgraded our room as we were offered discounted upgrade a few days prior to arrival the room was dark and dingy looking out onto a brick wall changed back to our original choice which was light and airy and much more pleasant the club lounge was very poor continental breakfast was dreadful only went in once there were refurbishment works ongoing throughout the hotel we were not pre warned about this it was rather noisy with workmen and fire alarm going of continuously on one morning ,0
 great location close to kings cross eurostar and russel square ,1
 staff welcoming room ok,1
 tv didn t work poor lighting in room poor toilet roll fittings no dressing gown or slippers could have been cleaner room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms also room overlooked restaurant not up to 4 star rating shower difficult to operate,0

 excellent service overall and the rooms were very comfortable ,1
 the staff were sooooo friendly i am a young woman who stayed alone during a business trip and i felt very safe and welcome ,1
 i liked the close proximity of the olympia the underground car park and the shop onsite,1
 horrendous meal serve warm red wine food if poor standard cold draft throughout meal a very special night completely ruined house keeping such a low standard room hardly touched even dirty coffee cups left items left on floor no fresh towels or refill of tea coffee stains on carpet and filthy shower happy to forward photos on as this page won t except them ,0
 rooms unavailable at checkin maintenance of room poor,0
 all of the staff esp reception and bar people paul and a lovely soanish lady we didn t catch her name also the lovely concierge staff who parked and returned our car and packed it so carefully for us location was excellent loved the furnishings and the laid back feel if the place ,1
 we had first been given a room that was already occupied by other guests and just imagine the embarrassment walking into someone else s room in the middle of the night no apologies or explanation was made by the hotel staff then our credit card got charged twice and we still haven t received our refund having paid 250 per night for a room for 7 nights i expected better than this ,0
 when my colleague got to the accommodation there was a renovation being done so my colleague was booked in a shabby room somewhere in the basement and when he demanded another room because the room was all filthy he got another filthy room he was not pleased and we will not be booking here again ,0
 extremely friendly and helpful staff good location for tourists who can walk to many attractions a happy and vibey place to stay ,1
 the mezzanine ceiling was so low the bathroom floor was cracked the entrance was awful the tv didn t work and we spent the night awake because of an incident with crazy person screaming outside with police sirens etc breakfast ended at 10am on a sunday ,0
 refurbishment which we did not know about small musty room extremely expensive drinks ,0
 location is amazing for travel from heathrow and to visit most sites in london very near a tube station on one of the best tube lines coffee shops beside the hotel ,1
 most things,0
 curtain was broken staff didn t fix it seemed disinterested effectively slept on an ledge in front of an open window for 4 nights facing a busy street also their internet was unusable half the time so i had to find coffee shops to do work for the price per night totally unacceptable ,0
 noisy air con expensive,0
 perfect area amazing lobby,1
 great staff they were very helpful friendly and courteous at all times a good location comfortable bedrooms a fine breakfast every morning ,1
 staff rooms no ac in the hotel as mentioned by reciption manager also there is no security inside the hotel and some people make bad things inside hotel ,0
 nos cobraron por un upgrade que no era tal ,0
 the management,0
 loved being so close to south bank and to waterloo station and that the room was spacious and very good value for money for a family of four and loved the nespresso machine in the room ,1
 maybe this hotel has two distinct classes and i was in the below basic some reviews give it a high mark not sure how this is a very tired hotel shabby frayed dim and dingy scuffed worn staff all look like they dread every minute i got a good deal for this area on this website but after my stay i would have been better booking a b b and taking a risk could not be much worse breakfast presentation was extremely poor widows dirty holes in net curtains ,0
 damp room that smelt bad air conditioning unit leaked i did report it but nothing was done shower was very poor and hot water was infrequent when i paid the bill after receive terrible service i even had to ask if their was any compensation for the terrible service and then the hotel reception gave the breakfast free which was an insult for having had to sleep in a smelly damp room in hindsight mi should have changed hotels after the first night ,0
 there was a tassimo machine in the room and the coffee choice was excellent ,1
 the room was described as a delux double and it was a box room the bed touched the wall on 3 sides and the shower was so small we couldn t get in it i caught a chill because my back was against the window all night,0
 checking in staff were very helpful and friendly room was cleaned daily to a good standard the bed was comfortable and the room was warm with a thermostat allowing us to chose the temperature only a 2 minute walk from restaurants and the tube very convenient ,1
 they should stop selling pigeon holes as rooms i have stayed in london before but this was a joke,0
 the cleanness of the rooms was poor for the money spend should have been breakfast included ,0
 extremely bad service ,0
 nice bathroom with big shower and bath quiet if you get a room on the top floors ,1
 excellent staff reception and concierge comfy bed brilliant restaurant,1
 friendly welcoming helpful staff disabled relative supplied with excellent support throughout visit room very clean spacious beds and bedding extremely comfortable all facilities supplied to a high standard food delicious and plentiful looking forward to another visit in the future,1
 location,1
 service very slow and inappropriate i ve been asking for laundry 3 times and nothing happened safe didn t work and so heating icing room not clean enough found hairs everywhere ,0
 picture on booking com we re not the same the hotel bed linens were dirty and disgusting no slippers in the room no water to drink as well ,0
 the bed was comfortable beautiful shower room and bath with elemis products tea and coffee making facilities in room ,1
 two of us had rooms in this hotel rooms are a insult to accommodation tiny some without any windows and so noisy you cannot sleep at all breakfast is about the worst experience you can have also lobby sofa out so tied and hardly clean ,0
 the hotel felt very prestigious and the view from the roof top bar was magical ,1
 location is fantastic short walk from waterloo station and very close to the london eye and the riverbank room was very clean and good size with impressive views of the shard and central london ,1
 i love the decor and that the hotel rooms are a good warm temperature on arrival the hotel is modern and sleek while still having a cozy feel and glow ,1
 1 rude and non organized staff at the breakfast we had to queue in the morning to get the breakfast while 10 12 table were empty the excuse given is the following you need to wait until we clean them and it is taking time because we do not have enough staff to do it not what do you expect from a hotel at eur 400 night 2 room is small to be fair i knew that and it is not an issue for me the big issue is that it was full of dust complained about it to the reception 3 most outrageous thing that happened during my stay was at the lobby we asked for some water and a diet coke the staff apologized saying that the hotel policy is to not serve drinks food in the lobby i was fine with that until 10 minutes later when a famous ceo arrived with his staff and been served all the drinks and food he wanted complained about it and even took a picture they did not care to reply i am not a millionaire but i expect to be treated as any other customer ,0
 do not waste your time this hotel is a total disaster not clean at all rooms very small smells very bad in the toilets this ruined our weekend ,0
 high quality breakfast not a vast choice but the essentials and everything delicious and top level if you have a car parking around gardette square is not the hassle that you can have in some other areas the area is very relaxed good bed ,1
 the staff,0
 toilet in room was disgusting drains had a nasty smell,0
 bed was very hard and uncomfortable not enough hot water to fill the bath bathroom cleanliness wasn t the best,0
 everything,0
 the first room they gave us with continuos noise from the bathroom impossible to sleep second room they gave us uncleaned bathroom full of hair everywhere upstairs family with children jumping till 1 30 am every night every morning we were awakened by the noise of a jackhammer used in the building beside the hotel the lift was out of order for 2 days during our stay the hotel was unfortunately frequented by very rude people ,0
 water leaking through the speaker in the shower massive health and safety issue staff rude they asked for a 50 security deposit on top of the full payment for the room total of 300 on arrival then on check out they asked for full payment on the room again they said the first payment was the holding fee and would be released back to my account so they had 550 of my money for a 250 room so that was 300 i hadnt budgeted for and couldn t spend on my activities i planned around london that day and my trip had to be cut short to summarise there s no point shelling out for this hotle as a treat you might as well get a travel lodge ,0
 turn room for the price i paid extra for executive it was awful,0
 great location for kensington and the west end,1
 i loved the small details with my hotel room the speaker in the bathroom made my bath at night one to remember my view was perfect and i was very satisfied with the convience the location gave me ,1
 a very good hotel comfortable bed nice shower and over all a clean and a very nice room friendly staff ,1
 everything,0
 beautifully crafted historic structure elegant sitting room and bar carved stairway leaded glass windows with window seats cocktail bar and high tea available a fresh bowl of apples at reception every day and bathtubs ,1
 booked a king size bed got two uneven twin mattresses pushed together staff overwhelmed at front desk waited over an hour for assistance before giving up ,0
 price is not worth what you got we paid 300 for 2 nights without breakfast room could do with updating very dated and dull ,0
 this is the second time i stay in this hotel it s clean and bed is calling my comfortable also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets,1
 staff where very friendly,1
 location excellent and the opulent decor really stands out staff were all very friendly and responded very quickly to any requests we made ,1
 the exterior of the hotel looks like a 1960s office block 0 curb appeal they don t show this on booking pictures reception area is modern like you d expect but it all goes down hill from there rooms look like they are still in the 80s with old brown carpets and wood furnishings when i first arrived i was put in a tiny box room with 3 foot bath and afrosted window that opened onto a wall in fairness they did upgrade me after i had to complain as i paid 112 for one night the beds are hard i can only compare to putting a duvet on a wood floor and using that for a mattress pillows are soft though in summary like a lot of hilton hotels dated and in dire need of modernisation there much better hotels than this is london for the same money or cheaper ,0
 the doors rattle so i slept poorly,0
 great hotel with wonderful staff and good cuisine ,1
 all,1
 1 i was given a room where i had to climb about 5 flights of stairs there was no lift 2 the bathroom was tiny and in the shower it was not possible to bend down or move your arms at all because of the size of the shower 3 there were two windows on the ceiling where light came down but there were no blinds to control the light it was difficult to rest and get decent sleep 4 i had paid for the room on line but at the time of check in i was told that it was not paid and i had to pay around 150 which was double the amount that i had already paid i asked the guy at the reception to check again i was then told that it was a mistake and the bill was someone else s however i was not offered any apology for this error ,0
 great location and excellent value,1
 never seen rooms that small very uncomfortable,0
 rooms dated showers and bathrooms poor and do not work well breakfast plentiful but very poor quality ingredients and miserable service ,0
 staff very helpful and upgraded us as it was my partners birthday also provided free bottle of wine,1
 its location ,1
 location,1
 locked in a lift soggy breakfast rubbish and i mean rubbish wifi tiny room barely big enough to walk around the bed,0
 noisy air condition noisy toilet noisy lifts even iron not working room telephone not working very slow response from staff for raised concerns ,0
 small rooms towels are not clean no good staff expensive food noise,0
 we loved the staff especially claudia everyone was so friendly ,1
 very overated and overpriced no better than a premier inn ,0
 walking distance to train and tube and bus stations ,1
 the bed and pillows were comfortable the shower had great pressure the staff were helpful and friendly location suited us perfectly as it was close to a number of metro stations fun bars and restaurants with plenty of happy hour s and the river we would recommend to our friends ,1
 helpful friendly staff comfortable bed and well equipped room liked the wet room style bathroom made use of left luggage facility made such a difference not having to keep cases etc with us all the time ,1
 price,0
 the service room toilet mattresses and simply everything ,0
 everything the rooms are as what they publish my son loves sataying in this hotel thisbis probably our third time staying here the staff and the facilities are great for a small family we were checked into our room 20 mins after check in time but they made it up with a bottle of complimentary red wine which we enjoyed that night would always recommend this hotel to friends and family ,1
 the location general cleanliness and the communal spaces,1
 an extremely beautiful hotel in a brilliant location comfortable beds,1
 it s close to the underground and you can see the glasses moving when the train is passing by also it s cold still with summer bedding we had a bad night and i got cold ,0
 totul,0
 everything location quietness ,1
 the room was not organized as twin beded which is booked a month before,0
 the hotel doesn t have a lift and when i asked the receptionist if there was one because we had 3 baggages he just answered no and he didn t offer to help us the curtains were ripped and dirty blood stains ,0
 3 single occupancy rooms each charged for two breakfasts and will not refund even though raised weeks before trip,0
 the hotel is in a fantastic location both by tube bus as well as walking from the heart of the city the room was clean and the stuff friendly the best thing about this hotel is that it is quite and in a fantastic location value for money for sure ,1
 the rooms are not cleaned very well the hotel and rooms are very tired the whole building needs a refurb and for the amount of money you pay i expect a lot more wouldn t stay there again,0
 came to spend the night here for my partners birthday i had contacted the hotel prior to our stay to see if they could decorate the room upon arrival which they did they sent a beautiful complimentary birthday cake to the room and decorated the bed with rose petals and a helium birthday balloon it was so amazing and really made my partner s day special also breakfast was served to is in our bedroom in the morning and i cant even find words to explain how amazing breakfast was how it was all laid out on a table with everything we asked service was amazing they helped with our luggage checking in and checking out couldn t have asked for a better stay ,1
 as a single female traveller i felt unsafe as door had no working lock the single room was also extra tiny overall place is shabby and most certainly not 4 stars i felt seriously misled by 4 star rating i did not stay in the end as thankfully found friend to stay with instead after seeing how dreadful this place truely is don t be tempted by the price whatever money you spend here is too much please read the reviews on tripadvisor do not book here ,0
 old fittings and smell particularly the smell of cigarettes coming through the vent in the bathroom guessing from the smoking rooms below shower didn t work in the morning as water either freezing or boiling so had to have a bath the 4 2 rating calculated by this site is confusing based on my feedback ,0
 although i did not complain at the time as i did not want to spoil what was a very special occasion the room had not been thouroughly cleaned there was a lot of hair in the bathroom did not display the tv message as requested complimentory cake was nice gesture but only one slice with one fork ,0
 standard room is amazing location is adorable everything was stunning from a to z from indoors design to really good noise isolation ,1
 how close it was to the o2 and that there was an entrance from the hotel to the o2 bed was really comfy and great shower and bath ,1
 no wifi bed uncofortable woken at 05 00 as my room was below the top floor kitchen for the price the low level of standard in both the room and bathroom,0
 most definitely not comparable to a 4 star much more a 2 star very basic small rooms and amenities poor,0
 easy to get to from the tube station staff friendly room was clean the location was quiet hotel was well presented good bars and restuarants within walking distance ,1
 location parisian ambiance,1
 the location was convenient ,1

 room was dark and gloomy only 3 milk pods no biscuits and no water on bedside breakfast mediocre cold scrambled eggs ,0
 new room and comfortable,1
 no internet it was important for me for my business really small room very bad location no shampoo and staff etc you need to call them to bring all bad sorry,0
 comprehensive breakfast efficient restaurant staff lovely bedroom ,1
 rich old wooden floors and moldings but fresh cleanly decorated rooms tiny of course delightful breakfast for just 12 pounds just a block to kensington gardens and hyde park restaurants all up and down within walking distance a 5 10 cab fare to most anywhere but we used the tube over two days and got around just fine ,1
 small rooms unprofessional staff,0
 staff unpleasant walking past lots of smokers every time you returned to the hotel view of sky dishes toiletries water etc not replenished furniture in room marked dirty ,0
 having stayed before i thought i would have been allocated a room on the floor that wasn t being refurbed,0
 hotel is under construction and disturbing noises start in the early morning free wifi but it disconnects every 5 minutes location is not the best place to stay poor breakfast far too expensive for what you get ,0
 the hotel is located on gas station never mention that low ceiling with tiny room i can t breath it seem like you stay in the cave beside it s not sound proof wall how can they get 4 stars hotel very tricky hotel i will not recommended ,0

 room was excellent bed very comfy and quiet staff were great especially leandro who was working in the bar on sa,1
 tiny room expensive no value for money ,0
 the views from our studios,1
 when booking the hotel make it very difficult to book with a company card when i asked to do this i was to provide a whole host of private information and after this was sent they did not fulfill the wish to pay with the card and charged the traveller instead when asked about this there was little acknowledgement of the inconvenience caused and when they finally responded they barely apologised and just signed off with the barest of responses too expensive a place to stay considering the fallow customer service experience very disappointed but sadly all to common in such places ,0
 excellent location very helpful staff,1
 good location it is closed to queensway station and hyde park 15 mins to bond street and oxford circus indeed ideal for those who enjoy running either in the morning or afternoon ,1
 too noisy,0
 cleanliness is very poor and rooms were not comfortable,0
 hotel was in a perfect location for us close to lots of the paris attractions metro station just across the street ,1
 the attitude of staffs especially at lobby feel not good nobody says hello to you mineral water is very expensive compare to other hotels which at least one bottle is free of charge never suggest to other friends about this hotel ,0
 friendly staff quick efficient booking in and out great breakfast theo s restaurant amazing and he came out of the kitchen to talk to guests ,1
 location,1
 room couldn t be heated staff did nothing about this issue breakfast had to be consumed in the entrance hall directly in front of the lift very loud music could be heard in the room ,0
 1 i have to wait until 3 30 to ckeck in 2 they wet my luggage when i was waithing for the room 3 i paid the room 2 months ahead and they want 100 cash guarantee and if you don t want to give them the money they will not give you a room it s a polity that it wasnt told on booking ,0
 the room that they gave us was for disabled people the bathroom was dirty after cleaning the room our dirty sheets were left in the room and after all they asked us to pay twice for one room very disappointed ,0
 too bad hotel service cause i lost one hermes belt in my room and the housekeeper said not find it so nobody try to sort the problem if every body lost things in room and the hotel can not keep customer staff safe why we live there to terrible,0
 some of the rooms weren t completely renovated as displayed on the website the hotel either smells like and indian aroma or sewage drains i have reported finding a spider in my toilet and there answer was simply it s impossible until i taped it again when i found the second as you take a shower wity clean water water leaks above the shower cap from the celing ,0

 perfect place to stay in the heart of paris attentive helpful and friendly staff good spacious and comfortable rooms ,1
 lovely style in the reception and lobby staff on front desk and porters were lovely very friendly ,1
 the shower in my room kept collapsing the wind howled through the window all night such that the air conditioning v noisy kept kicking in to keep the temperature up kept coming on i eventually had to turn it off we had a whisky nightcap in the bar which had bits floating in it the waitress explained it was from the ice we had specifically ordered without ice it took two of us complaining twice to get it changed v poor considering 12 50 per glass breakfast v average more like a 3 star hotel ,0
 dirty rooms and horrible stuff with a very bad attitude first and last time to stay there ,0
 great bed calm room big bathroom,1
 location was ideal for my visit staff were very friendly and helpful room was modern and clean ,1
 friendly staff good location,1
 the noise from screaming shouting guests in the nearby foyer went on until 4 30am the staff did nothing to help no refund offered no sleep weekend ruined booking com also uninterested in complaint ,0
 doesn t deserve a 4 star rating the staff were very unfriendly and not welcoming at all the restaurant floor was badly stained and breakfast service was appalling too impersonal like going into a canteen the front of house and hospitality was non existent the bedrooms were very dark and gloomy the shower head kept falling down so you couldn t have a shower one of the toilets didn t flush no complimentary water in rooms the restaurant was closed for dinner wifi connection was weak,0
 tiny room badly distributed clearly overpriced also not sure why booking asks me to re rate my stay i already gave a low vote it s not going to change even if they keep asking,0
 i booked 2 suites and their was only 1 available they gave me a 20 rebate on 1 suite but i feel they could have done more this was a very special week end for my family as we were celebrating my daughter s 30th birthday and also her engagement not a very good start to the celebrations ,0

 the room was sub standard very disappointed needed a good coat of paint stayed in better rooms priced up to much had one single plug socket for kettle on the floor ,0
 bed was really comfy and i was cold one evening and asked for extra blanket and it was sent no problem ,1
 having had to move rooms at 4am after laying awake for hours due to a faulty extractor above the ceiling we asked if rather than the complimentary breakfast offered to us we could have the amount discounted from our bill we don t eat breakfast we were told that wasn t possible by a manager who also said our opinion on the customer service offered was ours he had his own on the situation and then smirked at a colleague as we were about to leave as if to say we won so nice hotel terrible customer service by the manager on duty ,0
 the room not very clean food terrible,0
 gave us the smallest room as shown in the floor map behind each door as club room manager asked for 400 for upgrade stuffy room a c isn t working and asked us if we want it to be fixed i am supposed to check in for ready room professionals check your ac before you tell me your room is ready manager was trying to convince us that it is club room i will never recommend this hotel or even the whole chain to anyone it is not worth my money ,0
 fabulous location if attending the 02 arena all the staff we met were very nice ,1
 the hotel was absolutely perfect myself and my sister came for her birthday and stayed in room 809 we couldn t fault the whole experience and wouldn t stay anywhere else in london ,1
 almost everything the room we took smelled so bad when we further checked it was the problem of the sink that kept the water blocked inside it a guy came and removed this cover of the hole of the sink to make water run which happened but so slowly and we had to wait a lot of time for every time we were washing our hands then the air conditioner was not working and the air inside the room was still smelling bad and suffocating so we called them again they promised to come and then they did not show up we asked to exchange the room and they refused claiming that they do not have any extra rooms and everything is fully booked then we found plaster containing blood in the basket the knob of the air conditioner was broken and we could not turn it on or do anything the staff was so rude talking to us too about exchanging the room ,0
 extremely impolite personnel particularly in the restaurant room not propely cleaned room in serious need of refurbishment ,0
 staff were friendly professional and very accommodating excellent positioning between bayswater and queensway tube stations ,1
 convenient location to london underground and transport hotel is stunning and the staff are very customer focused and helpful breakfast choices of both hot and cold food were excellent rooms are very quiet for a london hotel and close to hyde park free wifi tea and coffee making facilities in the room,1
 everything,0
 the hotel very poor not cleaned and very old room no facilities i was soon impressed about the service this was the last time i stay in this hotel,0
 staff were rude and abrupt the beds we re like bricks and the walls were so thin one of the worse nights sleep i ve ever had ,0
 nothing was too much trouble,1
 told it was room only when in fact it was booked bed breakfast,0
 staff were rude and not very informative had to ask where and when breakfast was booked as supposed to be 4 star room basic and carpet all marked and stained only 2 teabags in room advised taxi to olympia when could have walked and would have been quicker ,0
 you can get attacked by gangs right in front of the hotel and there will be no security to protect you people from a different pub came to help thankfully ,0
 breakfasts were very good value for money,1
 from our arrival we were made feel welcome and really enjoyed our stay so much the breakfast each morning was excellent the staff were brilliant nothing was any trouble to them certainly would come back again and recommend your hotel to others ,1
 location value,1
 dated tv remote didn t work flys in the room wifi charges ,0
 receptionist offered a discount on the breakfast if we paid at check in after that it was not available however if you booked a room directly on the hotel site a complimentary breakfast was included in a lower price than booking com the rooms are filthy they put a queen size bed in a room large enough for a twin bed and call this deluxe the staff is surly what is to like about this place the establishment overrates its accommodations we reserved a deluxe room the first room we had was sub standard and filthy we requested a change to a deluxe room and were moved to a slightly better room both rooms were very low end when we requested a rate adjustment for the difference between deluxe and standard a difference of 150 pounds they gave us a 50 pound courtesy rebate hardly a sufficient adjustment they admitted to the low quality but did nothing about properly adjusting the rates booking com responded to correspondence daily requesting copies of the bill then copies of my credit card statement and then finally refusing to do anything unless i provided photos of the room beware of booking com and this hotel also take photos of everything questionable ,0
 the room so small dirty smelly dusty dark they re on renovation but no information and compliment ,0
 very nice hotel great central location very friendly staff ,1
 room 215 is right next to the lift the comings and goings of ither guest kept me awake for ages the fittings in the room are run down broken shower falls to the bottom of the pole totally unacceptable damp bathroom roof hole in the wall behind bathroom mirror broken fixtures around the bed really run down i paid over 200 for this i won t be back as for a calculated score of 4 2 your kidding i would not score this particular room better than 2 ,0
 they set up a cot for our 5 month daughter in our room which is were so pleased for staff were very friendly and always smiling service was fantastic ,1
 the room had a fridge which is so handy with a nice bottle of cold water waiting for me when i arrived also a plate of fruit was delivered to my room before i had even got there left luggage was also available which is so handy there is a free mobile phone in the room where you can browse the internet and make free calls from i think its called ihandy staff were courteous and helpful great location 10 min walk to paddington station and about half an hour to oxford st will be using this hotel again customer satisfaction stands out as a priority in this hotel ,1

 everything,0
 breakfast close to the apollo hammersmith friendly check in,1
 just that it would have been better if she didnt have to walk across the walkway as she has a height phobia but you didn t know this ,0
 this hotel was probaly the worst i ve ever been in the staff were horrible except porter the room wasn t to high standards and we were lied to we ordered a deluxe twin room and they first placed us into a standard room we then complained about this first saying they didn t have another room then swapping us with another person which is so dishonest we think that this is what they did to our first room as we were given smoking rooms when we ordered non smoking swapping people around is so dishonest aswell as upgrading people that payed less then degrading those who payed for the deluxe room i barely slepped at all not even sleeping the first night due to the noise of people in the corridor and the lift the twin beds may as well have been double beds as they are not separated they just put on two twin beds on a double base the cleanliness was terrible and they obviously do not dust at all the shower was extremely dirty aswell made our stay at london a nightmare ,0
 very good breakfast had gluten free bread and explained all the available food for my daughter we checked in earlier than expected which was facilitated with ease the lady in charge of the dining area was exceptionally welcoming and professional remembering us each morning great choice of newspapers and reading material ,1
 location and room excellent,1
 what i saw was miserable including staff behavior manager s behavior and quality of services this hotel s value is not more than 50 euro per night and it is not a 4 star hotel at all i do not recommend it at all as we changed our hotel after the first night ,0
 shower did not work in the morning and told by staff its because the hotel was full and it would be the same the next morning totally uneceptable answer 2 days at your hotel without a shower tv had a sky box only 2 channels worked itv and 5usa was told by staff it is hit and miss totally unacceptable answer air conditioning faulty no cold air after lots of trying with the controls room really hot and had to open sky light window but the noise from the major dual carriageway was herendous could not sleep both nights would never use this hotel again or recommend,0
 room allocated next to breakfast room so noise and smells from just after 4am no ventilation as window didn t open ,0
 terrible stay very unhelpful staff very disappointing for a hilton hotel after staying at many hilton will now be off the cards for this please be aware they add extras on for everything 15 50 extra per person for breakfast 25 00 to park in the car park over night terrible overpriced food in the restaurant what was meant to be a relaxing overnight stay turned into a very miserable time ,0
 location good restaurants nearby and train stan very close ,1
 very neat clever interior design friendly staff location not excellent for theatre otherwise a very smart and clean hotel,1
 staff friendly room clean and tidy quiet well organised great breakfast perfect location for tube also ideal having a car park under the hotel second visit to hotel will definitely use again when coming to london ,1
 sorry but didn t like this hotel at all ,0
 clean and comfortable hotel by hyde park and close to tube station good price via booking com made this great value ,1
 the staff couldn t have done more for us friendly and kind with little extras that made our stay all the nicer grand look a cozy room and a nice bar too really impressive and would definitely stay there again absolute bargain ,1
 the cushions on the bed and the big shower in the bathroom,1
 food good and service good all staff very attentive the room was comfortable and a good size ,1
 i stayed with elderly and they arranged an easy access room ,1
 room was cold with heating on one water bottle for a double room to top it off the staff were extremely rude and not friendly to new tourists they did not show any desire to help us and worst of all spoke in french to each other about us and laughed making it quite clear they were speaking about us i did not find this friendly or welcoming as someone visiting the city ,0
 staff are so helpful ,1
 room cold dirty and smelly no minibar no snacks no 24hr roomservice,0
 the location is perfect close to champs elisee,1
 very bad customer service worst room in the whole building was given a very dark plain room after requesting a room with a view and bath tub on a higher level floor ,0
 as a 57 year old who travels frequently i have never experienced such dreadful service in any hotel or restaurant absolutely shocking mistake after mistake orders not taken then a huge delay before returning to advise half the courses not available drinks order only partly served starter course missing part of main missing and in each case it took an age to get sorted with a waiter who was unfit for the job in every respect apart from appearance ruined a well planned evening and stay and this is an expensive establishment promising much but failing to deliver ,0
 parisians are extremely unfriendly even when they take grab your money for payment the taxi cabs seem to be able to charge whatever they want no two identical journeys ever charge the same price ,0
 i stayed here 2 years ago it was part of the eton collection of hotels and was excellent it has gone way down hill now old tired room 34 smelt really musty and damp unrelenting internal machinery noise and a window that didn t seal when closed and the noise from gower street was ridiculous certainly not good value for money ,0
 good breakfast selection and quality complimentary water and teas were great a wonderful last minute stay in a hotel that felt part of the history of london yet was beautifully up to date in facilities,1
 everything else,0
 the bed was very comfortable the pillows however could do with more choice perhaps a soft and a firm ,1
 great stay for my birthday with a friend amazing view of the river and the o2 couldn t ask for much more ,1

 no default minibar in the room only for charge in advance for the whole set of products in minibar unclean towels shower in the bath w o any water protective device like glass door or special curtain so that everything in the bathroom was wet after shower no toilet brush no shoehorn no euro adapters for sockets,0

 a wonderful receptionist aneta debosz who could not have been more helpful thank you,1

 perfect help from the personel bravo ,1
 very very poor service,0
 clean rooms no noise even when so close to the main street excellent balcony with a super view 5th floor nicely decorated safe everything you need for a perfect stay close to the metro station and this line brings you to all good places ,1
 hospitality is below average there is just one staff on the front desk and is most of the time busy the greetings is not their habit when called the reception you hear them mentioning reception which was annying and most of the time i could not complete what i wanted and they hang up the phone you will have a feeling that you are on your own very disturbing ,0
 all good except for teo things very near gare de lyon ,1
 wifi is rubbish rooms are very small dark and uncomfortable staff are unhelpful location is very strange ,0
 noise not friendly staff expensive,0
 the room was very spacious with an excellent bed ,1
 great location and very good breakfast,1
 location to attractions,1
 location only a few minutes walk away from various transport modes ,1
 location restaurant staff general standard,1
 definitely not 4 star four single beds in a family room hardly big enough to swing a cat i was upgraded to this room and travelled solo still not much room for luggage i couldn t imagine a family staying here the mattresses on the single beds were the most uncomfortable i ve ever slept or sat on way too soft still i only stayed one night and checked out the next day to a more comfortable hotel ,0
 excellent location great big clean rooms,1
 i was 7 months pregnant and traveling alone because my husband s flight got canceled and they gave me an underground room which i had to pass through the breakfast area every time i had to reach my room and it had a very intense chlorine smell not the best treatment ,0
 we know we can rely on a clean quiet room and friendly staff each time we stay the proximity to paddington station and to central london are great,1
 the room was quite a good size and bright and modern,1
 clean hotel great location and friendly staff ,1
 impolite staff and room tardy and uncomfortable with a dirty bathroom and thread bare carpet,0
 staff all had very good customer service skills,1
 everything except the space in the room,1
 we were upgraded as we were picked as guests of the day to top floor suite and free breakfast which had everything you could imagine 5 minutes from our venue that we were attending great hotel,1
 the hotel staff especially on reception were extremely friendly helpful,1
 good value and central location,1
 staff were extremely friendly and helpful in terms of directions and so forth the complimentary i newspaper was a nice touch too ,1
 room staff gym food,1
 parking charges 35 per night yet in westminster 24 parking was 20 breakfast was disorganised with staff cherrypicking the que to sit at tables the feel of this place has dropped from my previous visits breakfast supervisor did not lead by example and watched me help myself to 2 jugs of coffee for my table and the table next to us then told the waitress off very bad this hotel has turned into a money making hotel with no care for the customer years gone by the customer would have had understanding customer service now unless you are seen to have money by your race or creed you are dealt with accordingly floor staff seem scared of there employers and speaking to a couple confirm that they are is this a hotel i would support in future looks like moden slavery in the employment world ,0
 lied to by the receptionist who put us in a standard double room when we had paid for a queen deluxe room his response to the matter when we questioned him the next morning about the type of room we stayed in came across in a very negative tone and we were only refunded the difference in room rate because we questioned it had we have not mentioned anything we would have been charged full price for a room we weren t in as a lover of london i wouldn t recommend this hilton to young couples as we feel this was the reason we were lied to about our room and our room rate ,0
 excellent location very friendly and helpful staff an excellent breakfast overall a good value and comfortable hotel ,1
 be aware the o2 close some of their exits from the venue once the show has started turns a 5 min walk back to h tel into 30 mins my mum was disabled and really struggled and the o2 weren t willing to help ,0
 the bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss the food was absolutely gorgeous ,1
 it was a well worn hotel with little to offer other than its position which is excellent the staff were friendly but the whole hotel is well below the standards set by the big chains such as travel lodge let alone any mayfair top grade hotels i couldn t recommend it to anyone i know ,0
 the room stunk of cigarette smoke it was terrible the housekeeper brough an ioniser and told u it would clear the smell in one hour it didn t even the towels in the bathroom smelt of smoke it was disgusting we didn t arrive until late and my wife and son just wanted to rest and not move again we went to the bar and ordered some food the food was good as was the service upon presentation of the bill the food was double the price of what it stated on the menu i questions this and was given a different menu i told the barman that was not the menu he gave me after being looked at and spoken to like an idiot we found the correct menu he then told me that this menu changed three months ago he offered to split the difference in cost as a gesture of good will really aftef much shrugging and telling me itvwasnt his fault he allowed off one one meal which almost out balanced the cost i didn t even ask to compare the wine costs which i m sure we re charged at the new price too at check out when asked if i enjoyed the stay i replied not really and was given an am so sorry to hear that and asked nothing further overall so very poor ,0
 i was a little disappointed when i got there to be told i had to move to the hotel across the road and when i got there the room was so small could hardly turn around safe to say we won t be coming back ,0
 convenient location obliging staff good sized room excellent restaurant and coffee shop,1
 there were mice in hotel restaurant and staff were not bothered by it i reserved a double room and got 2 single beds room phone didn t work ,0
 basement room was small and not convenient ,0
 the hotel is very clean the double bed was very small it is a bad and a half in a double luxury room room had micro fridge and tea coffe but it is a very small room,1
 the location was great we were able to walk to every thing we wanted to see ,1
 we were going to the hyde park british summer time festival so this hotel was in a good location and very close to tube station staff were very polite and helpful on our first day we were up and out too early for breakfast so the hotel did provide us with a take away breakfast which was good enough and on the sunday we had breakfast in the hotel it was lovely good variety ,1
 small and very cold room heating only works with room card inserted heating fan very noisy waked me in the middle of the night windows glass not insulated very well ,0
 the bed was comfy and the room was lovely and large location to the o2 was just perfect ideal for the late nights after a gig and early starts if you would want a breakfast coffee elsewhere ,1
 miles away from anywhere and a badly converted 60 s concrete monstrosity this is premier inn standard and vastly vastly overpriced ,0
 great rooms beds very luxurious loved the speakers in the bathroom so you could listen to the tv radio staff very friendly and happy to help you options for breakfast were brilliant something for everyone ,1
 comfy bed good location,1
 the position the pool the bars provision of robes,1
 uncomfortable beds really poor accomodation service hotel offers nothing good ,0
 very basic room,0
 the hotel is awful it is not a hotel actually its only a villa with some rooms divided inside and they are very very small no telephone inside no restaurants too much noisy they don t have elevator the stairs are scary too much light in the rooms the curtains very old they wanted to charge me 10pounds for each hour late my last day and the guest relation executive was very rude i have asked for the general manager they said that they don t have any general manager i was really chocked anyways what i suggest is to remove hotel from the website and just say it is furnished small apartment this would be better and remove those fake pictures on their website because this is not true at all the rooms are not the same of the one on the website this is a shame to betray people ,0
 very old dirty and need renovation asap unkind staff late response nobody pick up the phone,0
 one of the male receptionist was not friendly when he knew im arab,0
 high cost for such poor standard of accommodation wallpaper ripped or peeling off painted woodwork all scuffed missing light bulbs scratched baths water leaks evident in bathrooms broken bath taps very noisy bathroom fan hairdryer not functioning correctly we were upgraded to an apartment which was unsatisfactory and then viewed 2 other rooms in a similar state before opting for the least worst old fashioned decor the whole hotel needs a refurbishment if you are spending 250 per night you can find much better elsewhere ,0
 give us free upgrade,1
 great breakfast,1
 bad value for money we arrived 11 at night only for 1 night stay the room was in bad condition with the shower barely working it looked like 2 starts hotel not 5 starts i think also that they put customers who book via booking com in a very low hierarchy in getting good room i stayed in this hotel many times before and this was the first time i booked via booking com for this hotel and it was my worst experience there ,0
 where do i start the whole hotel does not have phone reception literally i expressed i had to call my childminder allot and no phone reception in all of the hotel you have to wait outside for phone calls second they will not take a cash deposit for the minibar so you aren t allowed to access it without paying by card rediculous i offered them 100 pounds cash the food is disgusting and overpriced 30 for some scrambled egg and a coffee to the room ,0
 the staff we called the hotel ahead of our arrival to ask if there was parking we were told their was what we wasn t told was it was 42 so upon arrival we were met with a 42 parking fee in a non secure car park we tried to speak to the duty manager who was absurdly rude he spoke to us with no respect and told us if we didn t like the parking cost we could leave we were in complete shock he was so rude we are very well travelled and have never encountered such rudeness we also found the rooms dirty hairs in the bed wall paper hanging off unkept carpet now for the grand finally rats there were 2 rats that we saw on separate occasions and in different parts of the hotel my advice avoid this pit of a hotel ,0
 rooms,0
 dirty glasses cleaner walked into room without knocking asked for a towel they never bought it to our room noise started at 8am as there s ongoing building works,0
 great location with 2 underground stations very close easy walking across hyde park to tourist attractions hotel staff friendly and very regal public areas in the hotel didn t have breakfast but heard it was good little welcome touches like fruit biscuits and bottled water and usual tea coffee etc waitrose garage close by if your looking for good value sandwiches etc 10 mins walk to paddington ,1
 good location and very comfortable very quiet for central london,1
 lots of tv channels didn t work i was in the annexe across the road bit too narrow and felt small although plenty of space overall didn t appreciate the loud drilling which begun at 8 20am shower tap was tricky to operate not enough room to put the ironing board up inadequate hanging space for clothes ,0
 everything,0
 extremly small room was in the basement of the building nothing at all to see from the windows the air condition did not work during the whole stay extremly hot in the room the check in out times were horrible we couldnt check in before 2pm and had to check out 10 30am no minibar fridge expensive not worth the money ,0
 careless staff overpriced very poorly maintianed ,0
 beautiful hotel and the staff were cheerful and helpful location is great for the o2 and breakfast was delivered to the room on time and was lovely ,1

 comfortable clean friendly breakfast was good staff helpful,1
 great breakfast and good location,1
 sink and shower not working in the morning every day both the rooms booked it is unacceptable not having water in the room when waking up in the morning also considering we booked the best executive rooms available in this hotel we informed the staff about the problem but they were not able to solve this big issue executive room is not nice looking considerong this should be a 4 star hotel hairdrier is fixed to the table near to the bed and not possoble to use near a mirror or in the bathroom hotel is located in a bad area you have to walk 25 minutes to reach the underground station very unsatisfied about the stay in this hotel not recommended ,0
 clean and modern,1
 the basic rooms are too small in size ,1
 views from the bedroom windows were outstanding big ben and london eye,1
 there was no air con in the rooms,0
 rooms were clean and beautiful and loved the bathroom with the free standing bath,1
 the rooms very small why are the bathroom doors glass so see through why was the party charged 50 deposit for each room this was not in the booking details,0

 i asked for gluten free bread and felt happy that it was available the location was good specially to paddington station if you want to use heathrow express ,1
 everything was just amazing the people the room the facilities beautiful ,1
 service and cleaness of room,0
 poor leisure facilities and building in and out is weathered very disappointed in staff communication and made things difficult to book 1 when arriving at breakfast i was required to hand a card to enter i had to attend reception and then my room for i d to enter breakfast 2 i arrive at 5 30 to check in and wanted to use you pool in which after checking in and dressing for the leisure facilities it was 6 15 which was too late 3 when arriving in the bar their was inappropriate behaviour by non residents which led to my partner and i retiring early to our room as we felt uncomfortable this was identified by your staff but continued to escalate 4 on arrival and checking in we were upgraded to executive double room this upgrade felt like a downgrade as it looked weathered and bare looked nothing like your website our balcony was shared with 3 other guests and had little privacy very disappointed apologies for poor feedback ,0
 the room was absolutely tiny you couldn t even really walk the windows couldn t be closed so it was freezing cold and extremely noisy in the room moreover the air con didn t heat the room either the furniture is old and totally worn down scratches and marks everywhere the shampoo is a joke it s like it s gluing your hair together so you can t brush it anymore no conditioner has been provided generally it s a very dark and uninviting hotel i don t understand why people rate it so high i will not come back definitely not 4 stars in my opinion ,0
 well connected and quite location great breakfast service and stuff ,1
 service no hh points if you book thru booking com ,0
 booked a twin was given a double poor guest relations there and subsequent i wouldn t go back ,0
 very clean room very good location ,1
 quiet location,1

 the suite was excellent for our short stay with family and staff were very helpful and friendly hotel was in an excellent location and hotel facilities were good ,1
 location location location ,1
 the staff were frendly,1
 location and spacious room,1
 this hotel is appalling mainly due to the awful reception staff painting and sanding was taking place in all accommodation common areas during our 4 day stay on the last night of our stay toxic adhesive fumes filled the entire hotel the reception managers solution to this was to move us to another room which would have also been inundated with fumes understandably maintenance work needs to be done and there will always be guests in a hotel but the managements total inability to understand what they were asking guests paying full nightly rates to put up with as beyond a joke we checked out and moved to another hotel nearby which was fantastic ,0
 really good staff excellent facilities the hotel was changed from the original booking but this was dealt with professionally by the staff ,1
 the room had everything the room service was great at 3am and the whole experience wow d my girlfriend,1
 price sound proofing of rooms organisation price of breakfast price of parking,0
 i was very disappointed in this hotel especially considering it was quite expensive i wanted a full service hotel near paddington and could not justify the expense of the hilton the location as all i got the building is dingy the entrance was a walk up and the lobby was miniscule and the service was at best so so the room was tiny barely large enough for two twin beds and was depressisng to stay in i had a one day layover in london and thought it would be more convenient to stay in the city than at the airport wrong on my next one day stay i took a hotel at heathrow popped into the city and then back out the airport hotel was half the price of the mercure was much more comfortable and had a huge lobby overall four times the value besides being cleaner nicer and with more professional staff i am glad i had to endure the mercure for only one day a longer stay would have been awful ,0
 friendly staff,1
 very comfortable double room excellent breakfast very courteous and helpful staff very close to the tube many good restaurants in the area walking distance ,1
 staff very lazy and rude not helpful also woken up at up at 7am by fire alarm also rooms do not provide do not disturb signs to hang on your door so got woken up again by house keeping at 8am this was not a relaxing stay also there is no food room service after 10 pm staff are very lazy and rude not helpful we will never return to this awful place,0
 the staff where inexperienced and it took forever to check in the beds where extremely hard uncomfortable the room tv looked 10 years old was tiny and not widescreen they had in room collateral explaining the movie options available but none of these actually worked on the tv the breakfast was mediocre at best i didn t try the gym although it seemed ok ,0
 being made to wait in the foyer for half an hour for our room to be prepared the cleanliness tide mark round the sink the size of the room for the money paid wasn t a pleasant stay really ,0
 lot of nose and the room is bad,0
 sttaff not well trained poor breakfast for 14 euro truly small bed and very small bedroom elevator was broken and aid came very slow check out time is 12 00 but at 11 30 room cleaner tried to enter into the room when there was on the door sign to not disturb expensive overall for what you get ,0
 the bedrooms were lovely clean and comfortable the breakfast was also really good both selection and quality really good hotel would come again,1
 no toilet seat shower was a bath with an old shower curtain bathroom had bad smell crazy for money spent ,0

 the location good quality breakfast pleasant staff ,1
 the quality of the room was not up to par with the rest of the hotel there was paint chipping off the wall and an extremely questionable couch i wouldn t stay there again ,0
 the dlr and underground were too far away especially when walking alone late at night there is construction all around blocking many shortcut paths so you have to walk all the way around to get where you are going the bed in the cheaper room was fairly comfortable but the one in the suite with a view was all springs no cushioning they need to get free wifi in the rooms it is 2016 paying 7 50 per day for wifi nope you get 20 free minutes per day only the showers are hard to control temp wise but they were powerful and pretty clean the hotel is very understaffed this combined with the very worn and dated decor explains the price finally the place smells weird they need to get some febreeze or something ,0
 location view very nice staff pretty good spa,1
 close and convenient to kings cross station and the eurostar terminal with the 63 bus pick up at the door direct to the station ,1
 i didn t like reception staff not smiling at all,0

 the room i booked a superior room with a sofa as a birthday surprise for my partner we were given a very small room with no sofa and only one small tub chair the breakfast when we arrived i was informed that a continental breakfast was included in the rate although it didn t stipulate this when i made the booking we were expecting a full english breakfast which is what you would expect when it states breakfast included when i queried the difference between what i had booked and what we were given the staff member on duty far from apologising started arguing with me to make matters worse on our second night despite requesting non feather bedding on the booking the pillows which had been foam on the first night had been changed to feather ,0
 breakfast was amazing wonderful staff and excellant location,1
 friendly helpful staff lovely clean and comfortable hotel our bedroom was also clean and comfortable with a good view of the river thames and the o2 arena breakfast was very good with a large selection to choose from only a very short walk to the o2 arena being next door to it and with it s own walk way as well you re there in only a few minutes we really enjoyed staying here and will definitely stay here again in the future when going to an event at the arena ,1

 the lady at check in desk sarah when i asked for a spare key for my room assumed it was for a gentleman she said i will leave the key downstairs for your gentleman friend when it was for my friend who is a woman i felt it was disrespectful making assumptions that women that come to hotels are booking for gentleman friends 2 the carpets were not very clean in the room ,0

 we came for adele s concert at the o2 so the hotel s location was very convinient everything is new and very well designed we had an amazing view to the thames the breakfast was superb it s only one station with the riverboat to greenwich ,1
 old facilites very small rooms ,0
 noise early morning,0
 the breakfast wasn t great but what really horrified us was the concierge telling us we had 48 hours to pay the congestion charge but we now have a fine as the charge has to be paid within 24 hours so the poor advice from the hotel staff cost us 135 extremely disappointed ,0
 easy to get to great location ,1
 helpful check in staff at reception ,1
 excellent hotel only booked day before due to our other plans being cancelled and excellent price,1
 i really loved this hotel the location the view the building is absolutely stunning the staff very helpful and makes a big difference,1
 beautiful room,1
 i was assigned the room on the ground floor opposite to the reception which is different and so much smaller from the luxury single room advertised on the website i could hear all the conversation of the staff members at reception all night the window facing the street does not block the noise either on top of that the bed sheet was dirty i would really not be going back ,0
 staff rude and impolite,0
 thought i d got a really good deal through booking com and got a few nights at a great price wrong i wouldn t call it a hotel but more a bed sit bed cooker microwave fridge table and tv i was not happy at all with the price i paid and would have been furious if i i had paid any where near the supposedly 140 a night uncomfortable old bed with thin duvet and paper thin pillows drafty windows and door ,0
 good location,1
 value for money,1
 room is very very small not even room to walk around room is in bad shape you can not pay with maestro i did need to go to the bank to get cash money much better hotels in paris than this one ,0
 staff service quiet ,1
 the room and facilities are very nice i really wanna stay in all day but yeah we re here to travel the location is good there s a bus stop right in front of the hotel but you may need to walk at least 10 minute if you come from any underground station nearby ,1
 great location very clean great breakfasts nice big towels that were changed every day comfortable beds internet worked well also a plus that the guests have access to a computer internet with a printer in the lobby ,1
 hotel is rated as 4 star but it does not deserve even 2 stars 1 tiny elevator where a medium size bag can be bared pushed in 2 air conditioning was not operating every day the staff promised to fix it but nothing happened finally upon check out they revealed that it is a policy of the hotel during this season not to use air conditioning 3 without air conditioning it is impossible to stay in room windows should be opened but this is a very noisy neighbourhood of montmartre moulin rouge is aroud the corner so all night long you can hear screems shouts songs etc from the street not easy to fall asleep 4 room was so tiny two midsize bags could not be opened simulatneously no space for anything one should be careful for toes not to crash them against bag or the bad or the door 5 bathroom was tiny although two showers were for some reason a mixer for the flexible shower did not work only cold water was flowing 6 double bed was so small that despite my gf and i are very sportive persons and do not need much space we were almost at the edge all the time 7 corridors were stuffy,0
 confort of the bed and the view,1
 rooms are very small,0
 during the checkout the front desk manager insistently asked us to pay for a free beach bag 250k which the hotel left in our room we ve been to probably 100 hotels around the world and never met such a behaviour the overall experience was multiplied by 0 ,0
 even everyone who travelled paris before said that hotel rooms are really small it wasn t that much our room was more bigger than we thought the location is excellent near to rer b station luxembourg also a transfer station like odeon and cluny just walking distance to pantheon luxembourg gardens etc in addition near to a big market monoprix ,1
 very well appointed hotel with friendly efficient reception staff overall good experience set back off fleet street so no traffic noise ,1
 brand new hotel location is perfect for the o2 arena also for getting into london on the boat taxis would use again ,1
"you pay relatively cheap for a relatively good hotel. clean and good rooms. they are not big, but roomy and you have what you need. what is really important with the hotel is that it has an amazing location! litteraly 50 meters from the station, and a train from the station takes 10 minutes or so to get to central amsterdam. the busses, trams and trains of amsterdam work amazingly, so not living in the city center, but being able to go there easily is really great!   ",1
 beds were horrendous rooms need serious amount of work and money spent on them very poor,0
 everything it was excellant,1

 1 room was poor 2 charged a 60 excess fee in order to charge to the room despite declining that option which has not been refunded a week later 3 we arrived early not expecting the room to be ready they told us to call back at 2 and it would be ready we returned at 4 30 and they informed us the room was still not ready and that they where willing to give us a smaller room at no discounted price otherwise they could not promise when the original room would be ready 4 waited in the society bar for over 90mins before being served despite there only being 2 other tables of people ,0
 the staff not helpful,0
 character of the hotel plush with all the mod cons you d expect good location for st pancras station covent garden strand etc always seems a bit pricey in london as we are hardly in the room we would book here again,1
 the rooms although london s room are small this was a good size ,1
 the room was too hot and the air conditioning did not work my card key did not work anymore and i had to go back and forth 4 times because every time i was told now it works the 4th time someone came with me and opened the door with a real key there was a strong perfume smell at the lobby i was charged breakfast for 2 people and i only noticed it after i paid now i am waiting for the refund ,0

 no lift expected to walk up 4 floors with luggage no onsite breakfast had to go to another hotel for it neither of which mentioned on the website or booking com site had to get printed invoice from another of their hotels 4 for a bottle of water at a price that is too high for what is at best a 2 star hotel ,0
 breakfast reception all help and smiles,1
 the room,0
 i didn t like the fact i was charged twice for my stay on my debit card and i don t like that it s still not resolved and that i m being passed around the houses ,0

 the bedroom was drab the wallpaper was coming off the wall the bed was so hard it felt like i was sleeping on the floor the shower was painful the cold wet shower curtain was uncomfortable in the shower blowing around there were no coffee or tea facilities in the room toiletries disappointing ,0
 this is probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed at it is classified as 4 stars when even 2 would be generous the entire hotel is outdated dirty and rickety the walls doors and windows look like they have not been painted or even cleaned in months the carpets are worn and stained and the floors creak the a c is noisy even after it is turned off the staff are inefficient not very knowledgeable and unfriendly the front desk is a single clerk surrounded by many hotel guests waiting for attention no service attitude sour faced arguing nickeling and diming you on every little thing here is an example of their warped logic i had reserved a suite which was a larger than normal room i had requested in advance to have a quiet room not facing the main gower st that the hotel is on to which i had received an email reply saying that all the suites where facing the main road but were completely noise proof with double glazed windows upon check in i realized that indeed the suites were facing the road but the double glazed windows did a poor job in keeping the traffic noise out this was proven after the first night in which i got no sleep because of the traffic roaring by all night when i complained the next morning and asked to move to a room not facing the street i was told that i could downgrade to a significantly smaller room but the hotel did not usually reduce the price accordingly when i argued the point i was done a favor of reducing the price by usd 25 from usd 310 to usd 285 whereas according to the prices on booking com the difference should have been close to usd 100 when i protested i was told that by hotel policy i should really have been charged the walk in rate for the downgraded room which was close to usd 400 after spending more than 45 mins on this futile discussion i gave up ,0
 you will be arriving from a late night flight and they will make you wait to fill all the forms and pay for the entire stay on the spot and the manager will have an argument with you about it ,0
 nothing except the location i would not stay again,0
 price room relation is too high the room is small no hotel parking suck security check at entrance ,0

 the room was far from clean and there was stale milk left in the mini bar the area surrounding the hotel is not great ,0
 pleasant staff nice room great location for o2 arena which was why we were there ,1
 the room had been painted so both myself and my husband woke up with banging headaches from the fumes definately not worth the money and a superior room too very disappointing,0
 the decor very dated the furniture my bedroom is100 better expected a lot from the hilton but the luxury was not there for the price i paid it was like a cheap cheap hotel holiday inn would have been better and cheaper,0
 very small bedroom we could hear the lift during all night not a 4 star hotel,0
 loved the breakfast the quiet yet convenient location and the fascinating history of the place which is said to have been refurbished by edward vii as prince of wales for his actress mistress lille langtry the ornate public rooms are lovely as is the pocket sized theatre ,1
 breakfast was poor member of staff was complaining that she was on her own did book double room but was told 1 day before they had overbooked room service was also poor many items not available member of staff taking them to room was rude ,0
 the poor service i had to wait 45minutes for a blanket to be brought up to my room after 4 calls to reception and rooms weren t good enough for the price the bar food is over priced a pizza cost 10 95 and it s probably a 2 frozen pizza ,0
 hard bed small room no side tables lighting in room very poor very had to see to put on make up bathroom very dark no ironing facilities in room staff not particularly friendly except for the breakfast staff ,0
 location great very quite for being in the centre of london great room with a super comfy bed ,1
 bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window it was also very uncomfortable everything was small shower area towels etc on arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel ,0
 bell boys were very polite and ready to assist,1
 during a rare london heat wave in july the air conditioning exceptionally good newly renovated rooms with spa bathrooms breakfast was the best offering we had ,1
 no hot water both days television did not work when i informed front desk of the problems i further said i was checking out a day early they said it was ok but they could do nothing about refunding for the day i would not be there as i had booked it with booking com i left anyways as two days in a row taking a cold shower was not going to stretch into a third day,0
 dirty bathroom ,0
 friendly staff great hotel,1
 so called deluxe double room is claustrophobic it is overpriced but what isn t in london in addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not ,0
 staff unhelpful bordering rude apartments 5 minutes away from main hotel their largest rooms are suffocatingly small claustrophobic dark and damp feel to rooms we had an early morning appointment at a hospital near by the idea was to stay local so we didn t have to drive very early we had booked the apartment and large family rooms the apartment is 5 minutes away something they state in the description i mean who reads the blurb in the main description this would have been acceptable but then the second shock was the size of the rooms you cannot have two people yet 4 people living in such tight spaces they refused to refund we were left with a choice of staying here or head back home and travel in the early hours back it was that bad we decided on the latter you are all warned stay away from this place stick to more mainstream hotels and apartments,0
 shower was broken the room was small,0
 the location was great friendly staff ,1
 clean and comfortable staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 staff were very friendly welcoming was pleasant and all of my needs were met room was spotless very comfortable bed and large bathroom with shower and bath great views from the room and was extremely quiet would recommend high floor for good views of london eye big ben and shard would recommend to anyone and will be returning shortly perfect ,1
 good location close to paddington station and hyde park nice restaurants in the neighborhood ,1
 the location is very good,1
 the sofa beds were very uncomfortable,1
 bad rooms bad staff a shame that this hotel has the mercure name way overpriced for what it is if this hotel gets to close which should happen the owners will only have what they deserve ,0
 grate location guiet and nice room,1
 excellent location beautiful hotel friendly and helpful staff ,1
 staff location facilities,1
 everything was good,1
 proximity to queensway tube station and restaurants in bayswater makes this ideal nice hotel renovated rooms clean neat rooms small but perfectly functional for overnight stay ,1
 beautiful room responsive staff excellent management,1
 change the beds immediately as if am sleeping on concrete bed towels quality is bad and old ac constantly working ,0
 i could not wait to leave depressing bedroom old broken stained and tatty walls fixtures fittings and bedroom furniture noisy fan in room could not switch it off springs coming through the mattress pillows were old flat and extremely thin less than one inch in thickness ,0
 the hotel is in a very tired state we were moved 3 times and were finally upgraded to a business class room which again had worn carpets a filthy balcony and pubic hairs behind the sink as an added extra ,0
 the staff throughout the hotel were very helpful and polite nothing was too much trouble we were allocated a room on arrival which was not suitable but the lady on reception was so accommodating in finding us another room really quickly so that we could enjoy our weekend visit ,1
 everything starting from the small rooms to the bad services very old hotel everything make a sound when u open it drawers doors ,0
 the food was excellent and staff we helpful room wasn t ready when i arrived 2 hours later than supposed to be but was offered free drink x 2 to make up for it ,1
 helpful staff excellent breakfast,1
 asked for an iron at reception was met with a shrug by receptionist who replied they didn t know where they were no offer to find one couldn t care less attitude room decor tired and in need of redecorating cupboard doors right up against bed so wouldn t open properly ,0
 we didn t spend much time in our room but the hotel itself looks very stylish the rooms have lovely decor features although our room is quite basic looking location was nice plenty of restaurants to visit ,1
 small rooms even for couple very very small room i don t know why it got 5 stars ,0
 breakfast service was poor cold toast and you had to wait a long time for your eggs small buffet tables very close together and cramps staff had poor english dinner at bistro was not good lamb rogan was unrecognisable and staff was unhelpful and uncaring ,0
 this was booked as business trip for a colleague using a company credit card and booked through the booking com website as far as i was aware everything was paid for as you took all the payment details during the booking as i wanted to pay for it the person staying then told me the room was not paid for as he arrived which is very embarrassing and he had to use his card to secure the room then on saturday morning i receive an email not even a phone call to advise me that i had to complete a spreadsheet and send photos of the card used for the booking otherwise the person staying would be charged to their card i was at home and the card was at the office so i didn t have access to it i then had to send photographs of my own card to the reception at holiday inn and pay for it personally suffering credit card charges because of this absolutely outrageous situation as you can imagine in this day and age having to send images of my credit card to someone was not exactly ideal as i have no idea who the hell these people were i have had to call reception of the hotel and get told this is some new policy i will categorically be not using holiday inn ever again and have no idea what on earth bookings com think they are playing at ,0
 taxi service was bad they did not have a free shuttle to the airport like most major hotels in major cities they had their own private taxis that you had to pay extra for every time i see this i think there is an under the table bribe somewhere i had to walk about 200 meters to get a real local taxi ,1
 food and reception and rooms were fabulous,1
 the room was amazing the staff are very helpful and the views from the sky bar are phenomenal especially at night we stayed following a concert at the o2 and the distance to walk is negligible it is clearly sign posted and there is even a special exit to from the hotel o2 for guests of the hotel which made it that little bit easier it has really set the bar high i m not sure there is a better hotel in the country ,1
 rooms could do with some attention throughout especially for such a premium london based hotel should spend some money on renovating other than that it was all smiles rooms service food was bang on ,1
 excellent location and knowledgable staff,1
 staff were attentive building was beautiful and original features were amazing great location to hyde park kensington gardens ,1
 very helpful staff,1
 hotel too old definitely need a renovation smelly drainage problem and rusty toilet utilities dark room smaller than what the photos shown noisy refrigerators changed the room twice and waste a lot of my time without any compensation not even a late check out for free the staff is helpful but seems they are adapted to the complains i doubt these problems are usual ,0
 the staff are shockingly bad the concierge is unflexible and isn t interested in providing a true concierge service they remained of the opinion that one laundry collection per day was adequate and that no express service was available for anything handed over after 8 45am ,0
 reception staff were not very clear and unhelpful to bother to explain attitude problem they did not feel it necessary to be polite we would not go to that hotel again on our next visit to paris ,0
 very comfortable bed,1
 booking done true your site and next day the hotel contact me that they have no rooms availble and replaced me to an other poor expensive hotel so sad abouth their administration also the payment was not done how we asked for,0
 lovely rooms really helpful and friendly staff great location just a short walk to covent garden ,1
 where do i start this hotel is definitely not 4 more like 2 rooms were tiny no bar no iron in the room and when i asked for one i was asked to collect it from reception as the staff didn t start work till approx 9 00am no option for english breakfast and to top it off you could not eat in the rooms due to the expensive furnishings which i would say is questionable ,0
 the bed and pillows were so comfy i could have taken them home everything was great and especially as it had not been recommended and just picked out of a few looked at on line we were just so pleased and would definitely return ,1
 the rooms could be larger i had a few issues with my room which was handled very well by the manager in fairness to the hotel booking com should have provided a twin room option along with option for cooked breakfast to avoid confusion ,0
 client service very poor,0
 the towels smell bad and were old the staff put on my account half of the mini bar because i put it on the desk in order to clean some space in the refrigerator for some fruits of mine after asking for a person to come and check that everything is there and unopened they told me a red bull is missing and i had to pay for it despite we did not drink it the room service food was very expensive we could hear the noises from outside so the experience was kind of a bad memory ,0
 breakfast was great staff were friendly and very helpful and very comfortable beds such value for money,1
 my friend and i asked for a twin room we were given a double bed that split very small i asked to have another room after explaining i was told to morrow i could request a move much bettertwin room roomier why could this not have been done in the first place i also asked for a walk in shower only to be told only available in disabled rooms i would not recommend this hotel ,0
 microscopic room with very very poor space to move,0
 would appreciate a 2 level charge for breakfast i only eat a bowl a cereal matress too soft ,0
 the rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons we asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa the wc dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy ,0
 do not let the hotel call you a cab its twice as expensive as taking a black cab on the street the room was freezing and no way to turn up the heat breakfast really poor,0
 you could feel the springs through the the mattress the constant drone of trains and paper thin walls meant sleep was sparse when i actually got up i realized what an utter disgrace the room was furniture was scuffed or broken bed frames were rickety with metal bits hanging off blood stains on the carpet stains on the walls and bathroom ceiling and ripped upholstery and wallpaper the overall decor was also extremely dated i was offered a window view but couldn t see out as the windows were filthy also there was one usable socket for a phone charger but this was not near the bed or seating area and most of the light switches didn t work ,0
 if you like hotels in an unnerving area with a room temperature of the sahara or the north poll as the only options then this is the place for you ,0
 room service is awful what is offered to clients is less than a three stars hotel ,0
 bad service missing things noisy,0
 it was all wonderful,1
 room very ould cleaning not good,0
 the ac was not working well and the room was very humid i was locked out of my room by the 3rd night by the night shift manager mohin at 12 am and he coldly responded by telling me i did not cover the required papers at check in very improfessionally done as it could have been communicated in a message or letter ,0
 everything,1
 rooms staff service,0
 this is a terrible hotel i would give this zero stars if possible ,0
 staff were extremely helpful we booked a superior room for our anniversary and it was so quiet and nicely decorated with some nice touches breakfast was included in our price and it was well cooked and warm ,1
 the overall ambience of the hotel was very good and the staff very helpful friendly ,1
 good location cleanliness excellent breakfast great and always smiling breakfast staff thank you ,1
 customer service was excellent me and my wife felt very welcomed also the staff took the opportunity to wish us blessings on our new marriage ,1
 room n the bathroom s were very tiny you can hardly move people get safocatrd credit goes to the architect to make such a inconvenient place i would never visit again ,0
 read the small print normally when you book a hotel there are certain facilities this isn t really a hotel as we know it there is no bar no restaurant etc if you want breakfast its delivered to your room as there is nowhere to eat we arrived at the hotel and after checking in we were brought back to the front door and the girl pointed down the street and said your room is in that building not my usual hotel experience if you are into caravans then you would recognise the space saving features that the room entails we really did not like the toilet that had a sliding glass door in such a small room as we could not just run back down to a reception on leaving the hotel we called to the main hotel and asked reception if they had given us the best room they could have it got really awkward as the receptionist got quite defensive she went and got the manager and he was the same challenging us both the receptionist and manager became quite rude i would not visit again or recommend this hotel ,0
 when leaving staff member asked me to pay for the complimentry snacks which were actually free as another staff member told us when checking in this was a bit embarrassing because she was quite loud and kept saying you have to pay will be good if they find out the correct information before asking their customer to pay ,0
 friendly welcoming staff,1
 the photo shown while booking is misleading the room was very small bathroom shower was broken old hotel with old carpets not worth the money breakfast was average ,0
 no fridge or mini bar in room difficult to get to carport not happy staff,0
 friendly staff very helpful loved it,1
 no water for shower terrible smell in corridors,0
 i went to london to visit my niece who was studying in london this hotel was ideally located in earl s court close to her apartment and the tube station very nice hotel and staff nice selection of food at breakfast located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at earl s court ,1
 comfortable stay in a very central location nice clean environment well maintained by staff who are very helpful room certainly compact although it provides all the space required wonderful central location for access to attractions and good food ,1
 i did not like the fact that you could not have guest in your room after 11 they actually will come knock on your door and kick the person out if they dont leave when they ask them too ,0
 generally we had a very disappointing experience at the ashburn hotel we made the choice due to its location some good reviews and the look of the hotel in photos on line but were sadly mislead we have stayed in much nicer hotels for a lot less money at nearly 160 a night it is way over priced for what you get at first everything seemed fine and acceptable but the longer we spent in the room the less we were impressed there was damaged furniture in the room arm chair had a slash right through the fabric on one arm with attempt to repair it there was loose plug sockets on the wall the entertainment system controls did not work in the bathroom the bath robes were old and worn looking the vanity unit in the bathroom had been poorly repaired with gaps between all the mirrors the carpets generally throughout the hotel were worn and dirty looking the tv and music entertainment system was basic and limited the breakfast room was cramped the breakfast staff were unhelpful and not very cheery the reception staff on the other hand were very polite and helpful we expected a lot more from a hotel in this area of london and at this price my advice stay in the crowne plaza or radisson across the road at least there you what you are going to get this was a special trip for my wife s birthday and was slightly tainted by the experience we had at this hotel however the rest of our weekend was excellent and we were thoroughly spoilt and well treated at every other place we went ,0
 the service was excellent and would recommend this location as its got great connectivity and good restaurants at the bercy village ,1
 great location for an early heathrow express train ,1
 the staff were efficient and friendly the hotel was spotless the rooms were modern and had all the necessities it was a five minute walk to the tube station which was convenient ,1
 my hotel room was a mess when we got in their,0
 very tired decor smelly pretty certain something had died wouldn t go back,0
 far away from metro not in center of london more far away than expected especially at night nothing around for dinner at night apart in hotel hotel in front off a roadway staff not really efficient and customer oriented took them ages to register we booked a triple but never got a proper one wrong information shared etc low pressure of water the last day impossible to take a proper shower products for shower and bath for one while 3 ,0
 location was awesome breakfast was good the rooms are a little small but are much nicer than others i have been in in paris lovely lobby area,1
 everyone was extremely friendly and helpful i use a wheelchair ,1
 i have stayed here several times and the staff are very freindly the location is very good too ,1
 everything service was excellent as was the food within brumus ,1
 incompetent management and staff,0
 i regularly book hotels around london on a regular basis for clients in this instance i arrived at the hotel to pre pay for my client so he could check in when he arrived unfortunately after being assured that there would be no problems my client arrived and could not check in further more the guy at the front desk was rude and extremely unhelpful and should definitely not be working in a customer based enviroment terrible service and would not recommend this hotel to anyone please avoid at any cost ,0
 for me the best hotel i have seen in europe so far great quite place surround of lot of spaces to sit or walk the are many good quality restaurants nearby also small carfore branch supermarket and subway metro takes you to the centre or to the station where you can go directly and easly to the disneyland ,1
 i stayed at this hotel with my partner and was extremely unhappy when at 4 am we were woken to the male receptionist screaming to some young girls to get out of his hotel this is extremely unacceptable to wake other guests up shouting the main reason you stay in a hotel is to sleep not be woken up if the screaming wasn t bad enough at 5 30 there was a frantic knock at the door it was the male receptionist accusing my boyfriend of having the girls in the room and demanded to see who he was with i think this was very unacceptable when i spoke to the female receptionist in the morning about this nothing was done hardly even an apology ,0
 nice room with good facilities very clean and confortable very quite environment with a view on a public garden,1
 would not recommend this hotel it was in the middle of ongoing building work taking place had to change rooms around 11pm toilet in second room didn t flush propally windows were in a terrible state and curtains were moth bitten very poor,0
 complimentary wine fruit and chocs lovely touch near tube to get around but in a quiet area ,1
 room lovely and very comfortable bed excellent location would definitely use this hotel again,1
 i asked them to book me at higher floor and i had a room at lower basement ,0
 stayed 4 days with my family for the london marathon not a good experience the hotel is always crowded and not relaxing rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed in the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed satellite tv always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions the first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators the queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that i was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting inaccurate room cleaning one day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap the next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes the first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions location near waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street to find some bars overall this hotel was a terrible choice ,0
 1 bed was faulty seemed to dip in the middle very uncomfortable 2 very noisy room so got very little sleep because of 1 and 2 3 make up mirror faulty 4 cleaning disturbing me when i m trying to get ready for work 5 concierge whose response was oh dear i was not impressed ,0
 the place has a very good location surrounded by many facilities and well communicated the breakfast if booked early is worth just one complain they could have natural orange juice ,1
 very comfortable bed offered an upgrade without asking with lovely coffee machine very friendly helpful staff clean and felt safe travelling alone ,1
 we liked everything about the hotel ,1
 cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed they also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it ,0
 location very quiet,1
 superb location ,1
 poor customer service,0
 the location was delightful the history of the building was also a wonderful and great surprise the breakfast buffet was one of my favorites ,1
 charge 30 for a 5 years old kid for nothing and no extra bed very small room,0
 the property is in a state of decay it feels like being in a train station with buses of tourists coming in and out its such a pity as it could be a great hotel if they would have invested anything to improve it and refurbish it,0
 the service is poor additionally we have stayed for 4 night and no one came to clean our rooms,0
 good linen good food ,1
 very small and old hotel this hotel cannot say 4 stars i am not so happy when i go in this hotel i not understand why many comment say this this fantastic hotel ,0
 fantastic views ,1
 london city centre was easily accessible either walking or by subway ,1
 staff not very welcoming didnt help much when asked for help check in was not great did not explain to us about hotel facilites and check out time reception supervisor had no sense of hospitality was very rude if you are looking to have a warm stay and feel comfortable this would not be the place to stay,0
 the hotel was beautiful room was amazing lovely bath tub big tv bed was the most comfy staff friendly fancy lights in the room and incredible views from the room ,1
 great service good location for city centre good food very unusual minimalist room decor,1
 snotty receptionist toenail found in bed having to ring for towels bathmat tea bags pillows ,0
 the room was absoulty amazing clean comfortable felt very welcomed and the front look of the hotel with the elephant was spactauclar,1
 there is big difference of the price we booked from internet and the rate of the days,0
 very comfy bed duvet nice and light no air con noise good view from our room and great location superb breakfast ,1
 everything about my one night stay at this hotel was perfect especially the staff who couldn t have been more helpful or welcoming the purpose of my stay was for a concert at the o2 and with the hotel having its own private entrance to the arena the location couldn t be bettered i d happily stay here again ,1
 very bad hotel and air condition wasn t operating very bad odour in rooms it was the worst stay ever,0
 location good and cleanliness ,1
 the room was tiny compared to how the picture made it look the tv only had french channels despite according to the room information leaflet having 2 english channels the telephone in our room did not work we could not phone receiption or anyone and reception could not phone us meaning the receptionist had to come and knock on our door the reception was left unmanned and we walked in with no one to question us making it seem unsafe and anyone could walk in and use the lift to the rooms the stairs on the first floor had no carpet and i understand there to be some work happening to them however the smell of what i assume to be alcohol based solvent ran through the while hotel the receptionists were friendly and spoke good english ,0
 advertised as 4 star hotel hardly worthy of 2 the entire hotel is in desperate need of maintenance and updating some staff great the rest can t understand english the most serious issue is the fact that disabled people have to use a side door once the furniture is moved out of the way due to the age of the building that is not the problem and some staff are unable to open this door if there is to be a fire the breakfast i asked for bacon sausage and a fried egg got bacon and sausage as well as beans mushroom tomato hash brown and scrambled egg asked for fried egg again still waiting for it ,0
 was extremely hot in the room even with fan safe didn t work even after 2 days and more than 2 persons cleaning was extremely bad hair in the bath tub bath robe was not replaced for second day even was dirty and left on the ground early check in was not possible and hotel didn t even reply to the question about it before i arrived breakfast is average nothing special one day was very full finnished tables wasn t cleaned no fridge frankly was a waste of money lastly they didn t have an electrical convertor till eu all ones in the room are uk standard ,0
 the hotel is absolutely beautiful i loved the area in london westminster the staff were so helpful and friendly ,1
 everything the room is comfort and it is in a comfortable location ,1
 room is to noisy no water kept in the room they got my credit card details yet i had to pay every thing by cash at the moment some of the rooms have no double glassing and very noisy from the traffic and when i told them they didn t even apologies or move me to another room,0
 since had to leave at 6am we requested to have breakfast before then we had pre paid for it the staff responded that breakfast started at 7am quite late for this type of hotel and that no one could cook breakfast at 6am we then asked if we could just have some milk and 2 croissants no cooked breakfast as we had many times in other hotels when leaving early the answer was negative again please note that we made our request when we checked in so they could have made arrangements for the following day ,0
 the 1st room we booked was nothing like the picture despite ringing booking com and confirming that also upgrading the room through them also getting to the hotel we paid a extra 100 for a family room upgrade which was ok so on the whole the room costed us 460 for a family room which was absolutely ridiculous as we could ve stayed in mayfair for that price plus it was our anniversary weekend and wasn t pleasant at all will not be going back there again or booking with booking com and either ,0
 i have no idea what genius perks are location superb ,1
 service rooms,0
 rooms are so bad dirty and no iron in the rooms irons only in a specific room in 2nd floor where all guests use also the reception staff was not so helpful i had to ask for all feature of what i book,0
 too much broken stuff door lock broken kettle sink tap in a basement with claustrophobic corridors ,0
 very comfortable room and easy check in and lovely staff ,1
 everything else very poor value for money the bathroom was so small that my friend and i who both have mobility problems dare not use the bath or shower in case we could not get out again we were told that we had an upgrade to a larger room how small would the other room have been would never go there again ,0
 staff and operations i almost miss my flight as i had to check out at 5am and there was no one at front desk for 10 mins and the front doors were locked a joke for a 4 star this place should be ranked at 3 max ,0
 i reserved a deluxe room 34 m2 and they cheated me because they gave us a small room because the hotel was full this is not my fault ,0
 stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend the hotel was perfect a short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy we really enjoyed our stay ,1
 booked the shaftesbury but on arrival was told that i would be in the park grand over the road first room awful noisy and cold was moved to a lower ground room very grotty with paper thin walls all you can hear is tv s from other rooms and doors slamming good luck if you want a lie in as the noise starts from 6 am very small rooms and very shabby i would never stop there again ,0
 it would be good if wifi would be for more than only 1 device,1
 the staff was very unprofessional at first too many systematic mistakes they gave us a wrong room number were we entered to a room full of guests they denied the fact that we requested an early check in even after we showed them the email they denied the collaboration between them and booking com the room they gave us was very smelly furthermore we requested a taxi from the hotel they delayed the process the overall staff was very unprofessional unlike other novotel staff in other countries,0
 the beautiful facilities the room and the extremely helpful and friendly staff the proximity to the o2 cannot be beaten ,1
 the view from our room and the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff ,1
 overpriced i went to london many times but this hotel is terrible bad experience ,0
 small room no top up of tea etc on a 2 night stay purports to being a 4 when really 2 ,0
 we were in a smoking room ,0
 it was perfectly situated to see muse at the o2 it was a comfortable friendly and efficient hotel with a beautiful view over the river thames ,1
 i had high hopes for this hotel but a complete waste of money it does not live up to its 5 star rating at all there are far better hotels in london the cleanliness of our room was not impeccable as you would expect in a hotel of that standing and i have found better in premier inns the bed is good but the room was far too hot and could not turn the temperature down more than a couple of degrees so ended up calling reception in the early morning so we could finally get some sleep the worst was the restaurant food heated up not fresh and barely edible the chairs in the dining room were chipped and the tables outside were dusty such a let down that i will not be booking again ,0
 everything very helpful staff lovely rooms all finished to an excellent standard great free use of swimming pool and spa ,1
 missing hairdrying in the room old forniture no complementary water in the room usually present in this kind of hotel value for money poor,0
 comfortable bed,1
 great location great front of house staff,1
 great place wonderful position close to tube station and park for morning run complimentary fruits at the desk checkin and checkout might take a while ,1
 the customer service needs a drastic overhaul the manager is in the wrong job he looks a state and as for his welcoming as i arrived well let s just say i would get better service from a dustbin ,0
 do not stay here i had a single room i didn t mind the small size of it however the bedroom ac only sent out hot air even though it was set at 17 degrees the plumbing in the bathroom made noise all night and there was a green light in the hallway ceiling that was too bright and lit up the room at night a really uncomfortable experience i got about 3 hours sleep ,0
 loved my suite on the 7th floor,1
 the russell is one of my favourite hotels in london perhaps my favourite the architecture and the decoration of the ground floor in particular is interesting as well as charming the view over russell square is lovely the staff especially the concierges are very helpful and the proximity of the hotel to the british library extremely convenient ,1
 very good staff and service breakfast food looked good although no restaurant for lunch or dinner unique vibe and decor free wine fruit and chocolate on arrival ,1
 bed staff location breakfast modern 3 metro stops 2 kosher places near the hotel,1
 bed was really comfy love the crisp white sheets,1
 welcoming staff on the front desk very helpeful amazing location and view from bedroom ,1
 no complaints staying at hotel clean and tidy and not far from tube station breakfast was good bacon sausage and scrambled egg and pastries enough to set you up for the day,1
 lovely bathroom comfortable bed quiet room,1
 well positioned clean comfortable and well appointed room staff friendly and very helpful we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again ,1
 this was the perfect hotel for a night away in the city room was well designed staff were fantastic attentive friendly and helpful but not over the top and remembered our names each time they spoke to us great location and lovely residents lounge the cocktails were delicious and we felt we were in the buzz of things without the hassle fantastic ,1
 poor accomadation,0
 staff were amazing very helpful and always smiling excellent customer service bed was comfy room was huge and very clean,1
 holes in the bathroom ceiling shower was broke more like a 3 star stay away you have been warned,0
 location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed ,1
 excellent staff very clean and very quit room and the location is almost perfect my next stay in london will also be in this hotel ,1
 the hotel was not clean at all the rooms were dirty and there was nothing common to the photos we saw into booking the room was very cold air condition was not working they had an extra electric radiator to use in case of cold which is unacceptable for a 4stars hotel and no one informed us about it wifi was very poor even near to the reception rooms were not equipped as they should bathrobes slippers etc the staff was not polite definitely not value for money ,0
 love the hotel reception bar breakfast room staircase lovely and the room was extremly comfort clean and quiet though a bit small definitly re visiting again ,1
 room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke and very tired decor ,0
 rooms very small for price tiny halls and elevator limited english by staff resulted in wrong wake up call ,0
 the rooms are really small the cleaners left dirty pillowcases on the floor after they where done cleaning the shower didn t drain and couldn t close the door my girlfriend didn t get checked in and when she lost her key and after i told them that she will come back to the hotel without a key the receptionist almost didn t let her in ,0
 i loved every thing ,1
 the tap water smells and tastes like something died in their water tank the toilet seat was broken the in room safe didn t work and i waited 3 hours for a technician to fix it prior to the stay the reservations people delivered a last minute surprise telling me the day before departure that one of the dates i had confirmed i wanted was not available however it was available on booking com asked to check out at 1pm rather than 12 due to my meeting schedule and they said no ,0
 put in a very awkward situation booked twin room 2 ladies sharing but not available offer of a single camp bed added to room but would have been tight to move around or single bedding x2 not at all what was expected paying 244 a night can not trust to stay with radison again,0
 the bed was hard as a rock,0
 no service s in the hotel at all,0
 clean good room,1
 beds very comfy staff very friendly and helpful,1
 was convenient because our friends live close by furhthermore i liked the possibility of renting a bike on short notice and the interior was spectacular liked the modern twist ,1
 bed was uncomfortable concierge was nervous and shy and didn t welcome us well reception smells like chlorine staff were not great ie the bartender drank the dregs out of the cocktail shaker he made our drinks in in front of us breakfast staff confused and hard to communicate to dirty room service trays still outside the corridor at 10am lunch buffet was terrible beige bland and uninspiring ,0
 the price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in london the location is very good 2 minutes walk from earl s court metro station at piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in london direct from the heathrow airport and to all the popular locations in london near the hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes the hotel very clean modern and new the breakfast very good not too expensive for full english breakfast 15 per person at any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more the bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean this is my second time i m staying in the k k hotels in europe they are very good ,1
 very old worn down rooms our room wasn t clean at all terrible smell from the toilet hair on the floor hair in the bed slow check in check out slow wifi unfriendly staff very noisy uncomfortable bed no double bed only two twin beds pushed together too expensive for what it is ,0
 rooms very small,0
 great location 2 minutes from earl s court tube station nice room great shower good value for price ,1
 everything was terrible,0
 great staffs clean hotel and just a few minutes walk to hyde park,1
 this hotel was advertised as being convenient for wembley stadium it was a good half hour taxi drive away no easy access via underground or on a bus route it is situated near business units and student accommodation only one pub within walking distance ,0
 poor service tv lagging no wall sockets for charging mobiles stayed 5 nights and no change of bed linens at all mattress was uncomfortable pillows were limp and flat ,0
 unbelievable 4 stars and ridiculously high price how this hotel can be 4 stars room is very narrow bed is small no refrigerator narrow bathroom you cannot move your body in shower booth because it s too narrow ,0
 view from the 13th floor was lovely the room was comfortable and immaculate and the hotel was very accessible ,1
 the hotel is ideally located for a night at the o2 i wouldn t normally pay that much for a hotel but the location and comfort was second to none ,1
 even though breakfast included in my reservation during check in and every morning before breakfast i was told by hotel staff that breakfast is not included in my reservation i had to say breakfast included in the total price and i already paid it to trough www booking com web site there was no slippers in the room even though we were 3 we have never gotten 3 clean bath towels without asking for them the room was equipped with disabled stuff like tubular holding bars everywhere that i am not fan of it in the breakfast food wasn t marriott class actually this hotel isn t like a marriott hotel but like a budget inn ,0
 they was no free wifi having to pay 7 for interest access was not feasible dated decor needs updating ,0
 breakfast was good location was good ,1
 location cleanliness staff,1
 room and cost,0
 i loved the overall ambiance and convenience of this hotel the staff was very friendly and helpful ,1
 very nice inside and the room was comfortable,1
 the room is well laid out with everything you would expect for a pleasant stay although compact that s the norm for standard rooms in london hotels though the hotel is also within easy walking distance to sadler s wells and a little further to the british museum ,1
 location was great,1
 staff were very friendly and helpful room was clean could have used a new carpet ,1
 the bed was vary comfortable the bathroom excellent and room service very swift ,1
 friendly and helpful staffs,1
 service quality,1
 location,1
 very central to everything very clean superb huge bed,1
 the staff were very helpful the location excellent and the hotel very clean ,1
 lovely comfy bed and quiet bedroom ,1
 had a fantastic stay hotel close to the london eye and other attractions brilliant time had ,1
 it s not my first time in the leonard the ambience was loud and noisy we called the reception 3 times because there was to much noise in the above room because of the floor the room bathroom was very old you need to have a new furniture also the most upset thing was when we wanted to have a late check out for 1 of the room at least for an hour they didn t approve it was very upsetting thank you,0
 i had an unpleasant incident in this hotel some money from my wallet have dissapeared when i left it in the hotel room the hotel s manager considered that is normal for hotel s guests to be stolen i had been left with a bitter taste after this hotel accommodation and of course with the manager s apologies i recommend to the future guests to take care of their personal things in this hotel ,0
 firstly it was very warm 21 degrees on 30 march and the airco was still on wintertime apparently the airco is centralized and can t be managed per room so it was very hot in the room but the manager guillaume meant well and organised a fan in our room which gave some relieve secondly we went out one day by 1 pm so the room still needed to be cleaned when we came back at night the room was not cleaned at all when we complained and the receptionist came up to our room he was very unprofessional looking annoyed gazing at us as we have never travelled before not knowing what to say and to do no apology and not service minded at all he could only get us clean towers and even wanted me to go down to get them when i checked out the next morning the receptionist was aware of the complaint tried to help explaining that after 1 pm there is no one for housecleaning anymore but could not do anything the manager guillaume was called but he could not offer us anything in return considering this is a 4 star hotel which you pay the service for i expect the room to be cleaned even after 1 pm if they do not offer this service it should be mentioned at the website and at the reception furthermore the receptionist from the night shift should be proper trained to give proper service also what is the point of having airco mentioned if this can t be organised per room if you would like to have guests return to your property you should be able to give a discount after this discomfort but even that could not be done so if you are looking at the rating for this hotel it is not up to the 4 star standards it is also noisy being next to the staircase and staying at the first floor the breakfast is poor boiling eggs not a success you better go across the street to the patisserie cheaper and more tasteful also one morning the wifi did not function and since i am travelling for work this also did not help not coming back to this hotel again it is overrated ,0
 double delux was a 3 4 bed one side squashed against the window so not adequate for 2 adults fold up luggage rack provided bedroom too small to actually put it up not enough space for toiletries in bathroom misleading pictures for hotel do not show how small most of the rooms are very poor value for money ,0
 poor service,0
 everything,1
 very friendly and helpful staff ,1
 the hotel is falling to pieces i was in 501 i was not told it was a disabled room the carpet needs replacing very quickly filthy and coming up at the bathroom tread i put the chain on the door and tested it the frame came away the shower and bathroom were very old and dirty and battered the disabled shower was vintage there was almost no water pressure the soap dish fell to the floor as soon as i touched it the toiled roll holder fell to the floor as soon as i touched it the toilet was filthy and had not been properly cleaned for a very long time never never again ,0
 the location was perfect and charming just a few minutes to metro and st michel lot of nice restaurants nearby and good shopping chances,1
 the staff were lovely and extremely friendly my daughter and i felt very comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed our stay i would definitely use this hotel again and would recommend it to all my friends and family ,1
 we ordered food it took an hour and a half to get out the food was absolutely non edible and we we re not happy with the service after spending nearly 900 during our stay the manager came and halved the bill 8people and only one person at the table had there meal we were still charged 27 for drinks even dow we were 1 hour late for our taxi and we were still being charged as our taxi waited out side and we told the manager this and still got charged even dow it was there staff that held us back we came back to the hotel after thr first night and ordered 332 in alcohol and when we went to get another vodka we were told no because it was past 12 00 so my aunt had to practically beg for a vodka as she dosent drink anything else i didnt understand why as we were spending money in there hotel also i payed for my room on arrival and i was told i owed the full amount plus more before i left i was so embarrassed and it was said in front of the whole place the lady handed me a recipt and tryed to show me what i owed and i had already added 50 to my account that covered my bill i was made to feel so small it was totally uncalled for i ve stayed in park plazas before and never had such a bad experience ever also i stood at the reception standing my cornor as i knew i didnt owe 295 that she tryed to take the bathroom was rediculous and the shower soaked the whole bathroom when you used it and the carpet in our room was soaking wet when we arrived i honestly do not complain and its my first time to write a review but i felt it was appropriate ,0
 room smelled stale it was tiny old and in need of serious renovation bathroom was tiny and falling to pieces wasn t worth 50 a night let alone the rip off over 250 a night i was charged told staff how disgusting the room was they offered me a free drink will never use again,0
 comfy bed good hot shower good wifi excellent location for olympia and the hammersmith area happy to walk about this area on my own ,1
 room size we booked two rooms for one night and both were tiny one room was in the basement and the other room 105 was very small that you can t even move around the bed i have never seen anything like this in my whole life i asked the staff to change the room and they said they only have one available room that was the same size we ve spent more than two hours following a 4 hour long journey in the reception trying to cancel our booking but after numerous calls between the reception reservation centre and booking com they said they can t ensure any refund before the morning so we stayed that night at the hotel anyway and haven t got any response from them it was a horrible experience the mobile signal was also very poor ,0
 although not in the old county hall building as we believed the hotel was very clean and the bathroom and shower were very good ,1
 we loved everything from the minute we got out of our taxi on arrival to the minute we got back in a taxi on departure the hotel is amazing perfect for the o2 the staff were superb and made us feel that we welcome at every available chance so much so we are booking to stay again at the end of the month ,1
 staff extremely helpful room changed and upgraded to our complete satisfaction even left wine chocolates fruit and a card for a birthday ,1
 it is very new so in great shape but also it does seem well cared for it is a very nice hotel with everything you could wish for really but at a price great choice at breakfast i highly recommend the lamb sausages delicious i will definitely go back as it is so very convenient for o2 and it is nice ,1
 the fact that underground station kancaster is clised and you have to walk a mile to the next underground station rooms small with no noise reduction so you hear all the noise from the pub downstairs the hotel is generally very noisy giving you hard time to rest,0
 the location was perfect and so beautiful only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really ,1
 close to underground excellent service breakfast superb ,1
 the breakfast was the best i have had at a hotel the bed was very comfy usually don t like the pillows at hotel but these were very comfortable ,1
 location to queens club friendly helpful staff good shower good selection breakfast ,1
 style over comfort air conditioning didn t work i was moved to another room where the a c still wouldn t stay on a cool setting shower and bathroom fittings broken a dizzying array of lights on the roof walls lamps and even on the wall under the bed i gave up trying to find a combination that was workable the hotel is a maze with confusing signage staff in the evening were abrupt and bossy all in all unpleasant ,0
 the room was lovely clean and the beds were very comfortable it was also great to have the garden ,1
 swimming pool good sound insulation in rooms ,1
 staff are amazing ,1
 old tired hotel which lacked the basics rooms are way badly designed especially when they are so small uncomfortable beds and toilet shoved into the corner of the bathroom so that it couldn t be used properly,0
 building work around hotel makes transiting to from canary wharf difficult hotel very tired and windows filthy restaurants mostly appear closed staff in general seem very inexperienced and not interested bed was extremely firm and therefore too painful to sleep on give this one a miss ,0
 perfect location very close to a tube station and entrance to the park updated rooms great staff beautiful hotel,1
 1 unfriendly staff the white faced lady at the reception ugh 2 extremely tiny room 3 no value for this price ,0
 perfect location close to all transports nice and clean hotel friendly staff and a really nice garden the area was nice and quiet ,1
 where to begin run don t walk away from this property i paid for a single deluxe room which i had read was ridiculously small fine for me since i am knowledgeable on the european hotel standards being much different than american ones i was offered a room so small and claustrophobic that you could not raise your arms to the side without touching the wall bathroom and shower were so small and there was not even a soap holder to hold your soap i had to open the shower door and place my soap and wash rag on the sink i hit my knee several times on the side table just to maneuver into the bed the icing on the cake though is the substandard a c at this property what i discovered was that you have to place your room key in the wall to turn on the lights and for the air conditioning to kick in room was so hot that you could not sleep when i told them at the desk they did switch me to a better upgraded room and they were very accommodating simple amenities like fresh ice needed to be requested at the front desk i will say that property is in a safe location though somewhat confusing to find because a lot of the hotel properties look alike management needs to honestly portray the rooms as they are as i feel very deceived since my original choice was the size of a dorm room with a view of an air duct for any business travelers who are only staying one night this hotel may be acceptable though for anyone wanting to enjoy your vacation and get a decent nights sleep this place is not for you ,0
 staff very friendly room was a bit small but very clean and so comfortable location were just nice 6 walking to the lancaster gate station or bus stop or to paddington station super nice neighborhood ,1
 room was good and had enough hanging space for your clothes,1
 lot of noise from other rooms rooms are very small not well cleaned outdated furniture very limited hotel facilities weak concierge it does not look that it is belong to an international chain air condition was not working ,0
 bad as per 4 stars,0
 stayed in annex not main hotel which was very poor not made clear in advert very disappointed indeed ,0
 heating didn t work in the room no ceiling light in the room furniture and decor very dated,0
 upgraded to a deluxe double from superior or were we as it was extremely small unable to upgrade further which was disappointing bathroom was a tiny en suite which was a joke stairs inside room to the bed room was unbearably hot air conditioning didnt work staff arguing in the bar fire alarm set off staff unsure what to do would not recommend this hotel ,0
 polite helpful staff immaculate rooms and fantastic location views of houses of parliament and millennium eye from our window would definitely stay there again ,1
 staff was excellent,1
 poor cleaning service very few staffs,0
 clean as a whistle ,1
 travelling to london was stressful as i had never driven into london before however it was not as difficult as i had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of 45 however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport the hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience i would recommend the last floor 14th the views were fantastic from the balcony the staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a 10 minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive i can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good the sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip the london eye parliarment big ben london dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses all in all i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone ,1
 very clean very good breakfast very close to earls court station,1
 after being shown to our room we discovered the bed was broken we complained and told there is only one more room in the place in the basement this wasn t great but we didn t have a choice so accepted it then discovered that half the sockets on the room didn t work this if we r honest was more annoying than a problem then after a few drinks and a meal in london we get back to the hotel into bed only to find out that the underground runs under our room that will be us awake till 1 2am then at 7am the front desk phones us to say that s our wake up call which is fine except we didn t ask for a bloody wake up call no apology no nothing not one manager spoke to us about our disappointing stay after we complained numerous times would stay again ,0
 very comfortable beds staff helpful and professional central for the eventim apollo and tube bus stations excellent choice at breakfast ,1
 the hotel was clean and the room was well knitted out shower brilliant the staff were lovely ,1
 the indian at the helpdesk he is useless and the room s carpet so worn old hotel not good value u can go to course hotel sane street recommended ,0
 far 2 expensive for the room for 250 pounds i at the least expect a shower and bath only a shower in the room,0
 single room is half a room with a full view to a wall not really worth the 115 gbp half at the most you will hear the three elevators constantly bed is not even you will need to be careful not to fall while sleeping internet costs 7 gbp per each device ,0
 the room was tiny okay most of them are so in london and very noisy i could hear people walking behind the door all night long as if it was in my room the shower in the bathroom was clogged when i tried to complain nobody at the reception paid any attention though the staff at the restaurant was very friendly and breakfast was nice ,0
 the comfort of the hotel and the upgrade on arrival ,1
 on business i have stayed in many hotels so feel able to review constructively the rooms were the smallest i have stayed in although clean the carpets were dirty and stained and no kettle was available although tea and coffee facilities were in place when is asked for a kettle i was told there was not enough available then advised to leave my room and go to the bar on ground floor and ask for hot water if this hotel was a 50 a night stay totally fine but for 110 a night not acceptable the breakfast buffet was very basic and again not worth the additional cost plenty of nice cafes in the area ,0
 i paid the taxes in cash but they still charged my credit card i am still awaiting for the refund until now we werent allowed to check in at 1230noon even though i ve explained we will check out early morning 4am the reception lady was not nice at all in telling us check in at 3pm only when we came back at 3pm to check in another receptionist was on duty cathy was more pleasant and nicer quite a long walk to from train station this is not a hotel set up if you forget the codes to the main gate and room at night no one will open the gate for you so you ll probably spend the night outside we were given 3 towels for 4 people booking for 4 people ,0
 worst hotel i have ever stayed in my entire life it has the standard of a low class hostel rooms are tiny there is no even space where to put the suitcase the walls are dirty the floor old and uncleared it s really cold all the time and no insonorisation so there is no privacy whatsoever if you want to stay in your room during the day it s even worst cause you can hear the housekeepers talking and the doors being slapped so if you want to relax or work on your laptop forget about it the tv is on the side of the bed so i don t understand how you wan use you don t been have space to use the chair they have put so you can face the tv so what was the point of putting tv anyway the worst is that they ask you a prepaid 50 pounds and when you get into the room there is no minibar when i asked for what reason they said it is in the case i damage the room but the room is already damaged and in a terrible state the sink in the bathroom get stuck whenever you wash your hands there are plenty of hotels nearby and even ibis is far better so avoid as you can especially for the price you are paying ,0
 very old furniture and smelly carpet needs a heavy renovation wooden stairs are too dangerous ,0
 staff very friendly and helpful room excellent and clean,1
 very friendly staff very good location clean nice rooms very good restorant,1
 the beds are amazing so comfy breakfast was amazing the rooms where very very nice and the staff were extremely nice helpful and professional definitely going back ,1
 the location was perfect the bar area was nice but it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drinks order ,1
 a no fuss business hotel good location for my business related work awesome breakfast buffet warm and welcoming staff ,1
 in the morning the doors were banging everywhere i couldn t sleep the mattress underneath the sheets was stained the bathroom was not very clean ,0
 a warm welcome and friendly staff very comfortable accommodation and excellent bathroom lovely bar area excellent breakfast,1
 beautiful hotel with lots of history staff friendly ,1
 location,1
 clean friendly staff and breakfast was excellent,1
 the building is beautiful with so many wonderful period features the staff friendly and efficient and once the tubes had closed for the night it was wonderfully quiet on the lower ground floor super convenient for queensway tube station too i d definitely go back ,1
 words cannot express the amazingness that is this hotel from the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out the service has been by far the best i have ever received at a hotel the room was beautiful bathroom is gorgeous the hotel is just breathtaking my husband and i were set to elope in the city but due to the rain they let us use the library for our vows and let us take professional pictures around the hotel they treated us like royalty and we cannot wait to return ,1
 staff were unhelpful location is in a filthy dirty and dangerous area filled with drug dealers didn t get the room i paid for wouldn t refund us or change us to a better and safer hotel ,0
 good location very helpful staff rooms were spacious well worth the money very clean overall fantastic place to stay,1
 staff at check in were not very pleasant a bit grumpy,0
 lift got stuck fire alarm went off on a sunday morning at 6am ,0
 staff reception and assistance,1
 superior double room was tiny difficult to get in and out of the room steps down with a suitcase also no room to walk around the bed bathroom also tiny bath with no screen so when showering the entire bathroom was a big puddle the two lifts are small and one was out of action so the working one was very busy we had a train to catch so gave up waiting and struggled with our suitcase down the stairs ,0
 cleaning of the rooms is soo bad never seen this before they dont even wipe the water stains from the vanity and sink mixer my hair was left there the mattress is so bad my back still hurts housekeeping started cleaning the room next door at 8 am on a saturday leaving the door open while using the vacuum how nice is that ,0
 the hotel was lovely the staff were excellent really helpful friendly and approachable,1
 staff very friendly room was great air conditioning was a bonus as it was hot the day we stayed ,1
 great designer hotel and personnel tasty breakfast attentive reception stuff ,1
 the room cleanliness we had to ask everyday for the room to be refreshed and the actual cleaning was disappointing i would not consider the room to be of superior size even for london,0
 i had ordered a room to the backyard because i need a silent room for sleeping the room i got was also so compact that i couldn t stand up without knocking the head in the ceiling and the window was also in the ceilinng the room was absolutely not worth the money for that price i think they could have a room service for simple breakfast delivered from the new coffee shop at the corner ,0
 room was smallest i have ever stayed in and wasn t ready when we checked in at 4pm the room wasn t cleaned properly the first day no clean towels dirty cups left no tea coffee left the second day it wasn t even cleaned at all and the maid had dreadful bo ,0
 room was great spacious and had everything we asked for ,1
 staff were all very friendly and professional ,1
 drinks amazing and service from staff,1
 under construction stayed on 6th floor and there was no elevator therected was a mess in front of the window and room was very dirty don t stay untill it is renovated ,0
 the think size bed was very small and the room dirty,0
 clean room comfortable beds and friendly staff great breakfast ,1
 room,0
 buyer beware bait and switch they tried to switch my reservation to another hotel charge me the same rate but the hotel they tried to move me to was a lesser hotel that would normally charge half the price i saw them doing this to other travelers too ,0
 the rooms were dirty and the bed uncomfortable so much so i attempted sleeping on the floor in the middle of the night exposed wires in the bathroom as well as water dripping down a light in the bath room i wouldn t recommend anyone to stay here ,0
 location of the hotel friendly and helpful staff large and modern rooms despite waterloo station next door no noise ,1
 i have stayed at the pullman a number of times and always enjoy the experience staff are very friendly and attentive i tried the hotel breakfast for the first time during this visit and really enjoyed it great selection and quality with the nearby restaurants cinema park and quick access to the rest of paris on the metro it remains a great base to enjoy paris from ,1
 we had a suite it was lovely ,1
 absolutely beautiful building gorgeous room lovely bathroom felt really special ,1
 it was freezing cold temp in my room was 18degrees which i could see on the aircon panel it was impossible to heat up the room after hours of sitting in sweaters in bed with aircon set up to max heating it was 19 5 degrees this is unacceptable i complained and was promised a heater but noone brought it to my room my colleagues had another room and it was the same i also got mail that i can t get breakfast and can pay 10eur for cereal and order it to my room what a pleasure to sit in this freezing room and eat cold breakfast i definitely do not recommend to anyone ,0
 bed was wonderful breakfast eggs were a watery disaster the shower in the deluxe double was a drain in the floor shared with the loo the bathroom tile grout needed serious scrubbing gross and when i needed change for a smaller money denomination was told that was not possible by a blonde trainee but very quiet room with great view and close to paddington and harrods also the rest of the in house staff went the extra mile,1
 the real small room we got ,0
 the bed was extremely comfortable staff were very friendly breakfast was lovely a great amount to choose from stayed mainly for il divo concert the o2 was a two minute walk ,1
 hotel has character and clean with comfortable bed good location for access to the tube ,1
 lovely hotel staff where very nice and helpful would definitely recommend and stay there again,1
 room is too small,0
 seeing london eye just a stones throw from my hotel ,1
 i don t believe the room was in par with the price the room it s self was ok however the bed was too small my feet hung over the edge and i m only 5ft5 n my partner is over 6ft our room was situated on the ground floor next to the public toilets which kept us up most of the night with people going to the toilets and the cleaners filling up there buckets in the morning there was also no view and we couldn t open the window as it looked out onto the vents for the kitchen,0
 the was the noisiest hotel i have ever stayed in the walls are paper thin you could here everything in the rooms next door opposite and above could even here others going to the bathroom and on one night another couple across the hall getting to and from hotel with traffic was a nightmare on 2 occasions the taxi driver refused to take us to the hotel due to congestion ,0
 fantastic hotel fantastic location friendly relaxed atmosphere,1
 the location is fantastic covent garden literally around the corner right next door to the lion king and mumma mia so slap bang in theatre land couldn t be better we went with a group of 18 to celebrate our daughter s 18th birthday from the initial booking until we left the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful we received several emails to confirm everything prior to our arrival and the reservations staff were very helpful in arranging all the necessary rooms for a complicated group the bar manager organised a private room for us to have drinks before we left for dinner we went to 100 wardour street which i would also recommend for dinner dancing club ideal for parties at no extra charge with a lovely waiter who looked after us perfectly the doormen were super helpful in ensuring we got all our 18 year olds into four taxis making everything run smoothly and stress free all in all one aldwych is now our favourite london hotel and that is really down to the staff and location they also have a gluten free restaurant which is great for me and very unusual so no problems with gluten free options thank you so much for making our daughter s big day so lovely ,1
 the put my pregnant girlfriend and i in a single room with a single bed then when we said it was a double bed they told me i didn t know what a double bed was and that was the normal double room checking the photos on here it wasn t and they agreed to move us to the room we had paid for it seemed like a chore to move us but they made sure we slept in the room that was facing the road and had a club on our level next door worst stay i ve ever had in a hotel ,0
 location rooms friendliness of staff,1
 lack of communication asked if restaurant was told no then found out there was one one 2 days before trip ended room was no room to swing a cat ,0
 the property is centrally located very close to kensington park ,1
 staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean ,1
 the location the hotel itself and the staff are great,1
 reservation made via booking com with usual personal details submitted online and secured via the company credit card i was then asked for photographic id during the check in process when the receptionist was questioned on the need for id she was unable to give me a reasoned argument and then suggested that it was just part of the process they had to follow a little concerning given the amount of personal data exchanged by simply checking in to that hotel i was then told that payment was required on arrival as the booking was secured via booking com which was not a problem but i was then informed that i couldn t use my personal card because pre authorisation had already been made via the company card and which was taken prior to me even arriving at the hotel in addition after declining the 50 pre authorisation per night i was abruptly told that i could not use the mini bar my entire experience of the hotel was tainted within 15 20mins of arrival it is disappointing that the hotel cannot replicate their local competitors customer experience perhaps less of a security grilling and more a warm welcome would be more appropriate ,0
 the hotel charged us twice once with card we checked in with and again with the final card we wanted to use for payment what s worse is that hotel doesn t want to refund us with one payment even though we presented statement evidence ,0
 most everything the aircon is to noice and few more thing s i was not happy with ,0
 great location,1
 the single bed was really small even for a child had forgotten a necklace which was never found back free wifi at the lobby is useless not even suited for mail check the same goes for their business corner useless i was never able to change my airplane ticket using these facilities ,0
 amazing value for money incredibly central beautifully modern comfortable hotel unlike other hotels i have stayed in in paris which would charge the same if not more the air conditioning was very much appreciated on hot parisian days ,1
 rooms dated smelt of smoke plug sockets damaged couldn t get into 2 of rooms as they were not ready people in our group could not get changed for the evening we had a family party near by at 5pm when we came back at 10pm for the room keys was greeted by a rude male on reception manager took over and we received complimentary drinks ,0
 the room was tiny and gloomy and bore no resemblance to the website there was a construction site at the end of the street not mentioned on the website and we were kept awake by trucks in the early hours of the morning we d booked for two nights but left after one having had such a poor night s sleep this was a business trip and i couldn t afford another sleepless night the hotel manager was unsympathetic and rude insisting that i pay for the second night even though we didn t stay and had to find and pay for another room for the night ,0
 the staff were all friendly and accommodating the bedding is very clean and the bathroom is well equipped if a little small the breakfast is excellent,1
 nothing as we waited well over an hour for our room to be prepared then we got to the room to see a dirty bathroom and it was freezing cold so we asked for the twin room instead which was very uncomfortable,0
 on check in nobody gave me the option for breakfast booked a room without window but had a broken window reported this at 3am as it was freezing and a chap tried to fix it but couldn t and then left ,0
 very warm welcome clean and comfortable rooms close to kings cross and euston stations i would recommend this hotel ,1
 very unconformable very annoying,0
 very comfortable and clean hotel staff were very friendly and helpful great location beautiful view ,1
 spacious room with a brilliant view from the floor to ceiling windows super friendly staff nothing was too much trouble for them the hotel was in the heart of bercy village amazing restaurants and bakeries right near metro too ,1
 noisy reception next to room breakfast was ok,0
 location to olympia,1
 the single room was the smallest i have ever stayed in and i travel to japan a lot you could not even walk around the bed to reach the telephone as the pointless wardrobe actually hit the bed corner when i checked into my room there was another persons bag still in it i called reception to inform them i had just flown from australia and had an urgent meeting so had no time to wait for them to sort the problem out after 5 10 mins i had to call again as no one had arrived ,0
 the room is not easy to access ,0
 breakfast was good value nice lication,1
 the room tilted concave in the centre of the room which meant the bed tilted towards the door if we laid from the side of the bed our heads would be higher than our feet bedroom was okay old world charm in the room we were provided tea coffee but no bottle waters free or to purchase bathroom was okay shower was tub shower it was difficult getting in and out because the height of the tub basic bedside tables and a desk but limited room hotel had stacked the desk with a load of magazines and a pamphlet to donate to children in africa the front desk staff were cold and unwelcoming however the room staff was very kind ,0
 helpfulness of the staff and the little extras they provided for our childrens birthdays like free ice cream birthday cake drinks sweets and balloons ,1
 bedrooms need revamped room failed to meet expectations service and availability of food at breakfast fell well short of the minimum requirements value for money very poor ,0
 everything was wrong with this hotel very unpleasant ,0
 i booked a double room for 2 person but when i reached on that day they gave us 2 single room due to some maintenance problem of them yet still changed us to other property with double room ,0
 club room type was really nice thanks to the staff for upgrading our booking after no room available of our own pick at our arrival really quiet area two different tube stations to choose from at a 5 7min walk distance friendly and helpful staff ,1
 causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible ,0
 when we arrived we mentioned it was our daughters 3rd bday and they upgraded us to the penthouse immediately just because and when we got to the room there was a birthday message on the window a card and balloons in the room it made our weekend this penthouse has the best views of london i have ever seen best room we ve ever stayed in by far sadly our 3 year old got sick and we had to stay an extra night and the hotel were able to move us into another room straight away sadly she was sick on the covers and we asked for new sheets whilst apologising the staff were more than understanding and kind to us and we can t thank the hotel enough the staff were incomparable ,1
 loved it easy to get to the o2 i will certainly be back if i go to another concert the room was comfortable and so was the bed the staff were all very friendly and helpful ,1
 room lobay floor plan and room very cold,0
 out dated accommodation appeared quite grubby,0
 staff called my room to confirm my name at 3am twice ,0
 we loved to be in the heart of london our room was very quite ,1
 we ordered a room with view of eiffel tower at 373 euros but the room is small and we had completely no view of the tower inside the room the tower can only be seen at the balcony and we only managed to see the tower 5 mins every half hour because it s too cold in winter to stay at the balcony the upstairs are having party and it was very noisy it is the worst part of our paris trip ,0
 location quality ,1
 further back from hyde park than expected,1
 beautiful hotel clean tidy breakfast although extra was outstanding complimentary extras were a lovely touch ,1
 beautiful room we went for honeymoon and birthday staff was very friendly willing to help with travel information storage of baggage and tourist attractions hotel was in a beautiful location wonderful view of the parisian architecture stayed in the smaller room which was still quite spacious with beautiful wooden beams very cozy and romantic ,1
 new comfortable and clean room,1
 the double bed consisted of two beds pushed together which slid apart the whole night the room was cold and tiny and the shower had no curtain so the bathroom became soaked when one tried to have a shower it was also a lovely day and we weren t allowed out onto the balcony because they were re oiling the decking only good points were that staff were friendly and breakfast was included ,0
 service,0
 clean friendly and a high standard in the room bed was very comfy food tasted great even the buffet breakfast ,1
 so much potential with the shopping mall right on its doorstep missing a trick why no windows really dark,0
 exellent location ,1
 bad attitude of foreign staff lack of service,0
 don t order taxi through reception asked for a taxi for 4 sent car that was only suitable for 3 unmarked car and driver did not even know how to get to leicester square got out and hailed a black cab which also turned out to be cheaper staff very abrupt bordering on rude food expensive and not good quality ,0
 everything,0
 when we arrived at the room there were three men sitting on the bed apparently adding new channels to the tv no warning from reception the aircon unit made such a bad noise we had to turn it off and so the room was boiling the banging from the cleaning room door opening and closing all of the time was really annoying,0
 comfortable room with good views ,1
 location was great we walked there from victoria and very close to covent garden decor quite lovely beds and pillows very comfy showers spacious baths deep good amount of storage and in room facilities in room breakfast was promptly delivered and beautifully presented ,1
 it was dirty the toilet had big exposure to the outside because there was a big window in it we encountered a rat in the breakfast area while having breakfast and the bread basket was already with someone else ,0
 breakfast was superb,1
 i did not have time to use the hotel facilities for a one night stay however the bar service and staff in the lobby area was excellent ,1
 we were going to the o2 for a gig and the intercontinental was ideally situated with it being right next door to the arena the covered walkway to the o2 was an added bonus and hotel room to venue in under 10 minutes was well worth the extra cost seeing that there was no queuing for transport had we gone to a hotel further out and the added cost thereafter which would have made a cheaper hotel in the docklands on oar on price to what we paid at the intercontinental but without the hassle the room we had was a superior king room suite excellent bed was comfortable room was spacious bathroom was superb after the gig we went to the top floor sky bar fir drinks with a lovely view of the docklands skykine only one complaint drinks were very expensive 12 year old single malt and a malibu and diet coke didn t bring much change back out of 25 00 ouch breakfast in the morning was exceptional everything you could think of english continental plus other items english breakfast was cooked well croissants and pastries all fresh we will be using this hotel for future gigs at the o2 but will book an extra night in irder to take advantage of the pool spa and gym which we missed out on this time highly recommended ,1
 good location clean facilities helpful staff,1
 liked everything very comfortable hotel extremely friendly staff comfortable room breakfast is excellent 10 15 minutes walk to trafalgar square ,1
 horrendous evening meal room with no window staff didn t seem to be bothered about food completely different standard compared to previous hiltons ,0
 the noise in the corridor and the fact someone twice in my room in the morning while im sleeping,0
 extremely noisey at night doors constantly banging,0
 nice hotel room was beautiful and bed very comfortable did not expect big rooms in paris so size was really ok with 2 windows bathroom modern and new with a great shower staff was wonderfull since reservation they sent me an email prior to my arrival asking if they could help me in anyway and also asking if i had any special needs such as extra beds i had a last minute health problem in the family and had to arrive one day earlier and stay for 1 night less audrey was wonderful and managed to receive me before and dealt herself with booking to change my reservation i sent a note to her when i was entering my flight from cannes to paris and when i left the airplane she had already sorted everything out they even charged me a lower rate as on the day i arrived the room costed a little less in this same day saturday june 25 i went out with friends and arrived really hungry at the hotel at 1 30am and the guy from reception can t believe i forgot his name maybe hadesmi managed to open the restaurant and get to my room a nice aspargus risoto bread yougurt and a warm smile even thought riom service finishes at midnight really had a very nice experience at monhotel and recomend it ,1
 very small rooms a long dark and narrow hall no facilities no room service no minibar i very much doubt it is a 4 stars hotel ,0
 rooms are very very small no place to unpack your things and rooms are not clean ,0
 great location,1
 size of rooms,0
 the price extortionate cost through booking com i saw similar rooms going for 100 less after paying hotel room was too hot even with aircon on full terrible pillows shower pressure was abysmal had to resort to having a bath instead first and last time will be using booking com ,0
 reception staff cleaning off room breakfast staff lack of help doorman not helpful,0
 in booking com it says they provide extras bed when we were there they said we are not responsible about whatever writen in booking com stuff was unhelpful shower was bad water will go out during shower bed uncomfortable breakfast very poor,0
 the male deputy reception manager rafael had an appalling attitude deeply upset me and offended me to the point i was annoyed i would not use hilton again because of his lack of empathy and disregard for a clients requirements rooms are tiny also and shower was dirty i was told the hotel doesn t book through booking com and any requests made via the site are not noted or actioned internet would not work on any device i had either and once again the manager was not interested and said he couldn t help this was the worst hotel experience i have had in six months ,0
 breakfast was over cooked and dried out staff not particularly friendly the room was shabby the lift was out of order as was the toilets overall incredibly disappointing,0
 the staff was unfriendly and wifi was poor the porter boys were courteous reception desk was rude ,0
 broken iron room too hot air con noisey one tea bag no milk,0
 really good staff great breakfast and the bathroom was probably the best i ve seen in a hotel of this standard lovely to have a separate bath and shower which was really big ,1
 reception clerk mr redzoan is a liar and wouldn t take responsibility for his actions before the hotel s reservation centre i enquired about the possibility of changing my reservation but clearly it wasn t worth it so i decided to keep it as it was mr redzoan knew this he was standing in front of me with booking com on the phone when we all agreed to keep the reservation as it was still they considered it changed and charged me more than 600 on my credit card without my authorization and that was for one night at the reception they simply said contact our reservation centre tomorrow monday the reservation centre never replied my email fortunately booking com did the right thing and reimbursed me i hope they got their money back from this hotel and i hope they penalized the hotel be careful don t trust this hotel ,0
 quiet luxurious room more than we could have wished for superb service delicious cooked breakfast ,1
 really poor customer service overall not a nice hotel for your money,0
 l odeur the smelt it is smelling like sweadge or waste water every where the smelt is there even in the breakfast room in the basement he fitting room in the basement open only at 8 am and it is so small no coffee machine in the room the breakfast low cost products,0
 bad location pimlico not westminster very small room poor view all i could see was the side of another building may as well been on the ground floor staff stressed not a relaxing hotel at all queuing for breakfast at least 25 mins waiting 30 minutes to book in hotel,0
 late checkout and they even arrange champagne and flowers for our anniversary,1
 very small uncomfortable rooms no space for breakfast if you haven t booked,0
 very far from being a 4 stars hotel every thing except the location is very bad i can also say poor very high rate for nothing every single part in the hotel needs renovation the furniture is very old it was really a bad experience,0
 noise from aircon in the room that didn t even work rang staff and asked for a fan at least as boiling room yet they never sent the fan nor rang to apologise for lack of one not even a bottle of water in the room will not recommend or stay there again,0
 the staff was very rude they didn t held their end of the bargain with them everything was black and white ,0
 we were upgraded which was fantastic breakfast was very good very close to the london eye and big ben,1
 change in parking policy after booking the ability to park on site is why is booked the hotel and if the clarification had been made before i had booked i would have gone somewhere else the hotel and booking com didn t really care and were very unhelpful as they d already received the money ,0
 booked 2 executive suites and when we got to our rooms one was a suite and one had been downgraded to executive double we hadn t been informed by reception at check in so i thought i booked the wrong rooms i checked my booking and confirmed that i had booked the suites so went back down to reception to be told we had been downgraded due to a leak in the other suite no one called us to make us aware or give the option to cancel or refund and no one told us at check in we spoke with the manager who gave us an extra room and said he would look after us because it was a special occasion birthday nothing happened as far as this goes the executive lounge that we had acces to was dirty and felt inferior to the main communal areas ,0
 all the staff were friendly ,1
 too small rooms nothing like a four star no bathroom accecories which should be in a 4 star quite expensive no proper cleaning of the room dishes like cups and glasses aweful ac no cooling ,0
 no service at all the bathroom stinked and the room was cold,0
 swimming pool was one of best hotel pools i have been in staff were very friendly and attentive food was excellent and the view from breakfast also impressive ,1
 housekeeping room in the middle of the floor and they made a lot of noise bad internet connection rud staff,0
 great restaurant wonderful atmosphere and excellent location ,1
 very beautiful hotel,1
 the standard of the rooms and cleaniness was shocking i felt i was stuck in the early 90s other than the reception area the hotel was awful,0
 as soon as i stepped through the door a member of staff took my bags off my hands and gave me a ticket this was so that we could go grab something to eat whilst they hold our bags and wait for our room to be ready the room was amazing also ,1
 the desk assigned us a dirty room after they assigned a new room with tobacco smell the third room seems as if everyone has used it the definitive room has blood stains in the duvet the maids do not change the bed linen every day and you need to demand it incredible for a 4 star hotel in one of the principal european cities ,0
 staff was rude and unhelpful there concern was not for the comfort of the guest but how much money they could make for the hotel ,0
 loved everything amazing massage beautiful pool just lovely i will definitely be back ,1
 conveniently placed near tube and bus stations and earl s court high street very quiet since it s in a back lane nice view from the fifth floor ,1
 there was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small they start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint the toiletdoor is right by the bed rood staff in the reception both checking in and out ,0
 the ambience,1
 many things didn t work in our room as soon as we arrived asked front desk to have them fixed we were promised right away after 3 days still broken we were given an email address to write to about our problems but more than 3 weeks later no reply i wouldn t stay in this hotel again if they paid me also pickpockets right outside front door of hotel but hotel doesn t tell you to beware nor do they chase them off they tried to steal my purse broke the handle but luckily i had a tight hold on it very poor experience at pullman this hotel is only good for the view but i d recommend you stay somewhere else visit the eiffel tower in person front desk man who checked us in was very rude ,0
 nice and comfy bed nice bathroom great location a stone throw from kensington gardens ,1
 rooms are nicely decorated and bed was comfy nothing bad to say about the hotel ,1
 comfortable bed ,1
 every thing,0
 asked for a room with a view could have been any view and i wouldn t have known windows were extremely filthy and couldn t see a thing iron or trouser press didn t work heating refused to work tv had no reception and the shower was terrible seen more water from a light rain shower lift was like something out of the twilight zone and terrified my wife overall it was an over exaggerated luxury hotel ,0
 general condition of furniture is tired and needs refurbishing the shower on the morning ofcheck out was cold and staff not very helpful in getting it resolved,0
 tv reception quality was awful some of the electronics in the room just failed every time you tried to use them some of the staff members were unhelpful and patronising no bath robe in my room as standard so i had to call down to reception for one no obvious way of calling reception so i had to do it from my mobile after google ing the number ,0
 very dirty scuffed walls hair everywhere,0
 the breakfast and the garden are superior,1
 the food room and the two bars and restaurant ,1
 cleanliness staff service ,0
 i booked a junior suite and was upgraded to penthouse i stayed only one night 2 nights later i was back in london and booked the penthouse suite this time for the asking price the view alone was worth it london eye room i was honoured to be upgraded and may now always book their top suite rooms appart from that the staff were splendid the food super and bar very adiquate i grew up in london and never seen a view like this and a sunset like that i also own one of the most renowned sunset bars in the world and this came very close thank you for the amazing experiance ,1
 beds are amazingly comfy,1
 the hotel is very dated the whole hotel is dirty the rooms are gloomy we had to move room once as the first room smelt really bad the second room was not much better but we just had to get on with it as they would not refund us our money so we could go somewhere else the staff are rude and not bothered in customer service the breakfast is 16 for dry bacon and dry beans i would never stay here again and don t recommend anyone too there are much cheaper better hotels wish i would of read the review first i am not a person to complain about silly things but this really is a joke ,0
 the staff is not polite and cannot even take the pain of answering to a good morning the rooms are ridiculously small and dirty the bathroom is simply a joke 1m this hotel is not worth even 1 star,0
 no windows in the my room very old and chip furniture unpolite front desk stuff very poor breakfast,0
 the room was too small and badly designed e g wardrobe doors not able to open fully without getting stuck on the bed the room was very small for one person as there were two of us it made for an unpleasant stay we did refuse the first room as it was even smaller but the second room was only a little better the breakfast room was also small and very overcrowded ,0
 no open windows open door to accommodation to be greeted by five steps also does not overlook hyde park as advertised,0
 the noise walls are made of paper small no room to swing a cat ,0
 extremely central location and staff wer brilliant,1
 loved it here the convention i was attending was at the same hotel and upon arrival i was made up to hear that i d been picked as guest of the day upgrading my room with free breakfast very welcoming and lovely hotel had a great weekend ,1

 i am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place i made my booking via booking com we stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 july upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel it turned out that this was not the room we booked i had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings the room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it i intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day so i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to not the best way to begin your holiday so we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time the room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window we were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city in the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell and it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife i have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail the next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,0
 the bed was very comfy the view from the window spot on the kitchenette was adequate with cups bowls and cutlery ,1
 the rooms were very comfy shower was amazing the food was incredible and the staff were extremely nice,1
 seemed like a newly renovated or just new hotel great facilities in the rooms ,1
 lovely staff clean perfect setting,1
 breakfast is fantastic good quality and variety,1
 i had reserved online through booking com two rooms a double room for my parents and a single room for a friend of theirs i had booked both rooms as refundable on purpose if anything came up in the four months prior to their stay reading more reviews on the hotel in different portals i got worried about feedback on the size of the rooms and decided to go and take a look myself as i wanted my parents to be as comfortable as possible the lady at reception was friendly and showed me two rooms the size of the double room was ok but the single room felt really claustrophobic besides there was nothing warm or welcoming abt the place and i absolutely did not want my parents to stay there when i got home i discovered that i had made a mistake and only the double room was fully refundable while the single room was on a non refundable rate i called booking com right away and asked for advice they were very friendly and told me that most hotels agree to returning the money nonetheless which is in their discretion especially if there is still 4months to resell the room and the booking had just been made a few days ago i phoned the hotel straight away and they told me they would not be willing to let me off the hook i then walked by another day in the hope to have a better dialogue in person and the answer remained the same i did find a hotel nearby the cranley hotel bina gardens for about the same price which was absolutely delightful with tasteful big rooms where my parents had a wonderful stay i can only recommend to anyone looking for a room to look elsewhere it s unbelievable how different a package you can get for the same price ,0
 from the staff customer service to cleanliness to location and amenities everything was perfect we got upgraded for our anniversary which was a very nice touch choose this hotel and you won t be disappointed,1
 staff very friendly location was very good for me ,1
 the hotel is very tired looking inside and the initial staff were unhelpful and rude ,0
 location,1
 poor breakfast too little rooms for a too high price,0
 very small rooms hardly suitable for tall people,0
 everything i had the worst experience ever with my best friend really sad that the management does not really care for all the problems that is going on ,0
 poor internet connection executive room was very small this hotel is like a 3 starts hotel even less ,0
 everything was wonderful but it was just a little out of the way for us,1
 true victorian design ,1
 staff were inattentive and rude no sitcom in room poor breakfast felt like a poor budget hotel for a premium price,0
 comfortable stay location perfect for the south bank and a short walk to trafalgar sq houses of parliament big ben etc ,1
 very friendly and helpful staff spotlessly clean with modern luxurious fixtures comfortable bed well cooked breakfast with good choice ,1
 excellent breakfast clean bathroom and good amenities in bathroom nice comfy bed with lovely covers and pillows friendly helpful staff throughout the hotel,1
 expensive hotel rude staff but the location is perfect,0
 when we arrived we were told we had been upgraded to a double room room i had booked a twin room as i was travelling with a work colleague to a conference for work the curtains in the room were filthy and hanging off the wall and we were right next to the lift and we could hear it all night ,0
 we had an unfortunate situation my mother in law fell at the london eye area and fracture her hip had a surgery at st thomas hospital it was very close walking distance to the hospital and it was perfect the park plaza hotel was the perfect selection we enjoy a lot our stay despite that situation,1
 heating in room wouldn t turn down so red hot all night also the sink was a disgrace all smashed an unhygienic photo attached reported to staff and nothing done about it completed end of stay survey too,0
 good quiet location and very helpful friendly staff ,1
 the location is fantastic about 10 minutes walk to the waterloo station and london eye the studio double room is made up of 2 smaller rooms interconnected by a mini kitchenette there are kitchenware and microwave for use one room consist of a queen size bed and a sofa bed in the other suitable for family of 4 there is a public laundry room for those who would like their laundry to be done ,1
 georgia who gave us a tour of the hotel was brilliant very friendly and made our stay fab from start to end,1
 scruffy run down approach to hotel room was very spartan in decoration definitely no frills air conditioning is just a fan totally ineffective and couldn t open windows due to traffic noise so room was extremely hot and stuffy spot of fresh blood on one of our pillows just one small bottle of water in room barely adequate toiletries in bathroom 17 50 for breakfast is outrageous overall impression is penny pinching meanness,0
 overpriced for what it is and i think it s to much for this hotel to have four stars one other thing during my stay one day they forgot to clean my room although i put the the sign of please make up my room on the door in the morning and when i came back in the evening the sign was still on the door and they didn t clean the room so where were the housekeeping and their supervisors to check after them this what they do in four stars hotels ,0
 the attention of staff at reception was great having staff like that at the front of house is a bonus for any business very helpful and welcoming any questions or requests were attended to which is value to all customers again a bonus to the hotel great staff don t forget to give them the applause for the good job the do ,1
 location,1
 smart tv,1
 bed uncomfortable noisy air conditioning unhelpful staff ,0
 everything,0
 the bathroom was gorgeous loved that they had a speaker in the bathroom that was connected to the television,1
 staff were brilliant,1
 one of the best design hotels i ve stayed in wonderful staffs 20 mins walk to the lourve and centre pompidou ,1
 hotel was clean and staff very friendly and helpful it was located only 5min walk from hammersmith underground station so very handy for travelling into central london we flew into stansted which was about 50mins train journey to liverpool street then a further 30mins to hammersmith on underground the hotel was also close to a shopping centre and places to eat however the restaurants in the hotel looked very nice our room looked like it had recently been decorated and the rest of hotel was under going renovation during our stay would definitely recommend for anyone visiting london ,1
 no wifi in the room wifi in the lobby was very slow and impossible to do anything even to read e mails the charge for wifi in the room was 7gbp for 1 device 9 for 2 devices and 12 for 3 devices when asked if i could disconnect one device and connect the next i was told that this was not allowed once i used the code for one device it was unusable by another since i had to have internet in my room business traveler i paid the 12 gbps for 24 hours but even then internet was so slow that i decided to go to bed complaining about it was a total waste of time breakfast was decent but limited for cold meats for example they only had ham and salami i asked for turkey since i don t eat pork and they didn t have it no boiled eggs either only scrambled finally there was a serious mix up with my reservation but there was absolutely no service from the staff i ended up being charged about almost 100 euros extra for the exact same dates that i had originally booked my room through booking i asked for the manager but he refused to help me they told me to talk to booking which told me to talk to the hotel there was a fake kindness anything else i can do for you that resulted in no service anything i asked them to do they wouldn t do it but kept asking if there was anything else they can do for me overall the staff was so inflexible that were the equivalent of machines no human consideration whatsoever for anything you might have asked ,0
 our room was on the 5th floor with a view very clean and comfortable also quiet ,1
 clean location staff,1
 no water at all when needed even to flush loo due boilerwork no offer of compensation or change of accommodation found nibbled biscuit on floor delux double very basic with view of scaffolding no response from hotel despite 2 emails to manager very disappointing experience ,0
 i like this hotel i like staff hotel very friendly,1
 a great hotel all members of staff really friendly and happy to assist breakfast selection exceptional room well cleaned and supplied with bottled waters fresh fruit and tea coffee would recommend for business or leisure ,1
 the rooms were clean and comfortable the breakfast is outstanding and an excellent value the staff was very helpful and accommodating the lobby bar and sitting room are absolutely beautiful and very interesting ,1
 room smelled like a sewer,0
 superior room tiny room bed bathroom smells like cleaning products dated,0
 bedroom hair in sink plug hole peanuts under bed plain to see beds had never been pulled out and cleaned found socks in cupboard staff did not care a bit asked them to clean room when we went out but never did it maid knocking on door telling us to check out early so she could clean the room breakfast a joke took 10 mins to get bacon and sas by that time we had eaten dont go there ,0
 was at the pizza hut conference the evening meal was appalling 4 people out of 12 could not eat as their dietary require vegetarian lactose intolerant etc apparently we had informed you but this is only anicdotal my food was ok except the starter which was wired also how can you justify charging 19 10 for a pint of stella and a vodka and coke 2 50 for a dash of pepsi ,0
 closeness to the o2 our reason for coming to london,1
 excellent location very friendly staff with perfect attitude i definitely come back again nearby 4 closed secure parking with 36 per day ,1
 everything see above,0
 they did not allow to use hotel facilities asked for extra money,0
 i had booked a suite and requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for my boyfriends birthday and got a fabulous big suite with amazing views of the london eye big ben the houses of parliament and also they provided a complimentary bottle of red wine and a card which was a lovely touch bathroom was lovely with a great large walk in shower the hotel bar was also great which serves food until late if you fancy a late bite with a few drinks breakfast was also great with a lovely variety of dishes and a perfect start to 3 busy days definitely would stay here again as it made the mini break extra special ,1
 the way that they accuse you of stealing a tv remote when it was not even in your room when you booked in and charge your credit card for it if they treat there customers as badly as they have treated e they will be out of business pretty soon ,0
 loved the view and the space,1
 nearly everything ,1
 friendly staff great location ,1
 gloomy old smily sheets carried bags from stairs no left got rash all over my face when i walk up next morning,0
 the staff were excellent the room was small but comfortable and clean the buffet breakfast was very nice and great value for money ,1
 poor welcome on check in from front of house lady no personality no smile no effort room cramped bed uncomfortable lots of noise from below room and coming through aircon vents affected a good night sleep room stuffy due to no opening windows only air con raucous atmosphere in restaurant at dinner meant no romantic dinner for the wife and i food was poor ,0

 this hotel is not what was described in their advertised pictures the hotel looks like a deserted place the room s floor and in fact through thr hotel s floor are all wood plank the room feels like a blunker and wooden enclosure equipment like tv is dusty like no one maintaining it and cleaning it house fly in the room personally i don t recommend this hotel ,0
 staff were very friendly good breakfasts the building is full of character ,1
 the room was so small you can barely fit 2 suitcases down the sink hangs over the toilet because the bathroom was so small air conditioning broken and constant ringing noise coming from it tv you couldnt hear due to settings and noise from outside stereo that had not been reset and an alarm went off at 5am from a previous guest stains on carpet on the walls on the bed sheets and one towel and rubbish left over from previous guest overall a rubbish hotel ,0

 good location attentive and polite staff ,1
 great location for us as we were attending the radio 2 concert in hyde park lovely building and very clean with welcoming polite staff,1
 the bed was one of the comfiest beds i have ever stayed in ,1
 the single room was too small you couldn t plug in your chargers or appliances as the plugs were hidden at the back of a fitted unit next to bed i performed contornists moves to plug in the fan there was also a glass top that overhung the unit which caught on your leg getting in and out of bed the breakfast room was too small for the number of people using it,0
 air con was broken on arrival at 10 pm and a very warm evening although i was upgraded the room was poor no ironing facility in the room and the phone did not work to call down to reception to get an iron the bathroom was not clean overall cheap but very dated good location and the staff were polite,0

 the bathroom was terrible the sink was literally at the level of my knees and i m 5 5 tall the toilet was incredibly old and there was only a shower i met a friend who was also staying at the hotel her room was smaller but was completely updated with a full normal bathroom my room booked as a deluxe double had no refrigerator the bathroom was terrible it was located at street level where anyone walking by could see into the room so i had to keep the drapes closed upon arrival to my room i noticed the air conditioner was blowing warm air i went to the front desk to let the manager know and hopefully send someone to investigate i was told they would bring me a fan it was hot and humid in the room i asked if they could move me to a room even a smaller room with working air conditioning and i was told no because i had already used the bathroom in the room i was in i guess they expect a guest to hold their water after a long flight and an hour ride by taxi from heathrow just in case they need to change rooms while discussing this with the gentleman at the front desk another guest began to express the same complaint his air conditioning was not working he wanted to be moved to a different room and also was told no he had the opportunity to check out and go to a different hotel i was stuck with this hot humid room because i had paid for the room back in march through booking com they offered no compensation not even a breakfast the next morning after a miserably hot night with a fan the air conditioning quit working completely the windows could not be opened to get fresh air i was stuck for the duration of my stay in this room that i had paid over 200 00 a night for i noticed as i walked barefoot in the room that the bottom of feet were now black from the dirty carpet after that revelation i wore socks in that sweat box they called a deluxe double disgusting ,0
 what didnt we like most things to start with beds were by far the most uncomfortable bed i have ever slept in it felt as if it was falling apart and for that reason very noisey both myself and colleague shared a twin room 302 heating was broken freezing cold night only 3 working plugs in the room how are business people meant to work carpets were really dirty also which is very off putting huge draft through the window made our night totally horrific it was freezing made sense why there was a portable heater in the room which was useless pillows were falling apart i had to sleep my head on a blanket we were also awoken to the bin men right outside our window at 6 am for a solid 40 minutes for 10 cheaper i could have stayed at the millenium hotel just down the road which is by far much more superior and also much better value for money its not even a cheap hotel to warrant having such bad qualities ,0
 dirty no air conditioning rude staff shabby decor noisy smelled dirty unhelpful reception ,0
 the old furniture,0
 excellent stay staff were very attentive we rang front desk for harder pillows member of staff was at the door within 5 minutes couldn t fault the place ,1
 there were all sorts of problems with this room the water took at least 15 minutes to get warm every morning the tv iron were broken on arriving and the staff were all quick to respond but slow to resolve any issues the room itself is basic and quite small i d only stay here again if i had no other options ,0
 the room was not at all as depicted by the images it looked wonderful on the pictures river view wide ground to ceiling french doors balcony open and airy reality was a cell with a port hole that would not stay open unless propped with a pen the night was for my husbands birthday linked to seeing guns and roses and so was a treat room service did not answer on three occasions we rang reception who said they would pass on our message and room service would revert to us this did not happen the price of overnight parking was charged at 16 but on booking com stated 12 this was reviewed and amended i was upset and embarrassed that the special occasion was ruined by poor description of room as i would not have booked if it had been described as it truly was and other services on offer were not actually provided the trip had been planned for six months and turned out not to be the perfect experience that i had wished for my husband i felt let down by false advertising,0
 location is great close to the city and you can take bus to everywhere as the bus stop is very close to the hotel ,1
 every thing,0
 the receptionist was very rude and abrupt the room was a disable room with a horrible shower and rust around the bottom of the chair in the bathroom etc the bathroom was very dirty ,0
 the hotel needs an upgrade as bathroom was very dated and not clean beds are very uncomfortable and the sofa bed is just terrible all theee of us had backache after only one night sleep there 4star for this hotel is definitely overrating definitely not worth the money paid ,0
 the staff were lovely and the bed was huge very accommodating and not so far from the city centre,1
 very loud not great food pretentious people bed very uncomfortable lots of mistakes wouldn t stay there again will complain to booking com,0
 beautiful room overlooking river great size and lovely bathroom ask for highest floor available if you have requested a reiner view both restaurants and bars lovely with great views breakfast worth the money ,1
 friendly helpful staff lovely room couldn t have worked out any better,1
 there was a refurbishment going on at this hotel that wasn t advertised we couldn t even get access due to ladders the hotel needs a lot of work our room was tiny no where to put our suitcase without blocking the door poor d cor light was broken tap in bathroom was broken and bathroom generally poor single duvet in double duvet cover and bed not even made well polyester pillows rubbish and no extras supplied were supposed to stay 2 nights but checked out after one and didn t get a refund even though we alerted them soon after checking in 100 a night absolute rubbish value for money better off checking into a premier inn ,0
 too small room no flexibility on checkout,0
 friendly and helpful staff,1
 the staff are very rude before i booked i asked if i could have a massage booked they told me yes this is the only reason i booked a spa with a hotel when getting there i wasn t shown where anything is i called the spa repeatedly for an hour no answer i then had reception get the spa to call me to which the man said the therapist has no time for treatments i said i need a massage just got off a 14 hour flight to which his response was unfortunately not my problem i sat alone in that room for 24 hours annoyed and in pain disgusting service for 5 have contacted the hotel since and they like to ignore my emails ,0
 the friendly staff at the bar front desk concierge houskeeping they were all excellent very professional ,1
 breakfast was delicious the staff were so attentive to our needs the heated floor was divine ,1
 great character with very polite staff fantastic entrance hall ,1
 a very nice new hotel with the biggest benefit being its close location to the o2 in fact it is connected via a hallway directly to the o2 as well a large car park but not free unlike so many london hotels it feels very open and spacious we were given a corner room with a brilliant view of both the o2 and the thames also in room coffee machine was better than normal staff very friendly and helpful ,1
 room was very clean with great facilities for my son including the sofa bed 12 noon checkout was also helpful ,1
 we stayed at this hotel as we were going to a show at the o2 perfect as the venue was only a short walk away about 10 min and there was a covered walkway from the hotel to the o2 staff were exceptional and were always smiling nothing was too much trouble will stay again without a doubt,1
 good location near the key attractions for the family london eye shrek adventure etc the italian restaurant was very good excellent margarita pizza and cheese cake ,1
 location very good just around corner from queensway station and lovely olde worlde deco in hotel,1
 excellent welcome from friendly and efficient staff ,1
 on arrival at 16 00 in the afternoon the room was still not ready for my checkin i booked an excutive suite which actually turnd out to be a normal room with a sofa i was told that the fotos in booking do nt always correspond to the room the executive suites are situated on the executive floor next to the exective lounge however you are not elegible to use the lounge unless you pay a surcharge of 30 00 did nt feel welcome ,0
 lovely hotel from start to finish very clean comfortable and a good night sleep the staffs can t do enough for you well worth the money cant fault anything 10 10,1
 it is really old poor infrastructure the carpet is dirty in now days no free wifi is unbelievable the cost is just ridiculous ,0

 brilliant stay ignore the negative reviews rooms are small but very stylish and clean ,1
 no plans to stay again,0
 really comfortable room with good sound insulation friendly helpful staff great breakfast good location for tube apollo theatre and local restaurants we ate in the hotel restaurant which was nice ,1
 interior of the room very poor condition cracked floor tiles in the bathroom furniture extremely tatty liquid splats up the walls and a fruit pip was left on the breakfast area was poor tables partly clear my daughters bowl had dried on porridge and coffee and tea cups stained floor and windows had food marks on them hotel generally very tired and i won t be returning very disappointing,0
 the room was very big spacious the bath tub was large enough for two people i love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains the park location was amazing,1
 room and en suite very well set out and very clean with great shower hairdryers beside mirrors large and comfortable single beds and no feather pillows good staff attitude helpful and friendly yet respectful which made for a relaxed stay very convenient for the hammersmith apollo and the piccadilly line ,1
 double booking stillawaiting a response from booking com unhelpful staff poor breakfast over priced,0
 doors slamming view from room 12 was lovely of skip from some sort of building work basically not happy,0
 the saga starts at check in although they had charged my credit card for the entire stay prior my arrival which is ok as i chose non refundable booking option they tried to force me to sign an old traditional payment slip on top when i refused they said they would not let me in to my room although they took my money for it after half an hour of nerve recking quarrel i managed to get into my room then comes the part where it becomes an issue for the trading standards office the hotel is listed as a 5 star hotel but it is no more than a b b the pictures of the rooms i booked deluxe double have nothing to do with the actual one i had to stay in when challenged the front desk i was told the pictures on the site were of executive doubles and they get complaints often with no regret ,0
 the staff were extremely friendly and very helpful ,1
 the whole hotel needed refurbishment and was dismal the mattress and pillows were like rocks bedroom walls were thin and other guests were noisy we couldn t sleep the shower had inadequate power we complained and were offered a discount if we stayed again so they did try to make amends but i won t be staying again ,0
 supposed to be a deluxe double room it was not two singles zipped together no mini bar as offered not even tea or coffee making facilities in the room walls had paint missing or bubbling off wall socket hanging off wall the so called pe acceptane of the payment card was taken right away and 150 pounds more than agreed price by book com,0

 comfortable welcoming great location room with free soft drinks was helpful ,1
 the toilet smelled of a fresh number 2 when we arrived and the bowl wasn t clean the room was on the road and very noisy wifi was not included in a 4 star hotel which i found strange the staff were rude,0
 when we arrived the receptionist rejected us because we are booked 2 connecting room for 4 people but we are came with 5 adults 1 child and 1 baby actually i m not the person who booked this hotel my secretary did it for me the receptionost told to us that we can t add an extrabed so we have to add 1 more room or we can found another hotel hello it s 9 30 pm and you told us to find another hotel actually we really don t mind if we have to add 1 more room but the receptionist is already rejected us before asking if we okey to add 1 more room or not i read in the booking policies that we can add an extrabed but the receptionist said that we can t this hotel is really not recommended ,0
 i have nothing to complain about ,0
 entrance hall and bar area kept its original features,1
 it was desperately in need of refurbishment,0
 great location close to tube station and short walk to dominion theatre which we were visiting that night ,1
 the hot and cold alternating temperature the noise from other rooms the really noisy fridge in the room that groans all night the tiny uncomfortable beds trying to find the hotel from the station ,0
 except for one member of concierge the staff were unfriendly and not very helpful the heat inside the hotel was very stuffy could nt open a window as they were jammed closed fridge was nt working so nothing stayed cool ,0
 the hotel design is great comfy stay and great location,1
 the staff are not brilliant precisely they were not clear if i had the breakfast included i went to the breakfast area and they told they thought it was not included in my room so i said it was fine and was about to leave but then they made a call to check and told me that everything was fine not precising what that everything was i asked are you sure and they said yes i thought it was included and had breakfast then when i did the check out they told me i had to pay the breakfast that everything they checked was that i had a credit card so they could guarantee i would pay later but they forgot to mention that i explained the situation at the reception deck and they said they were sorry for the misunderstanding but i had to pay anyway 12 pounds for a quite bad and limited breakfast i will not recommend at all ,0
 location was good,1
 nice atmosphere comfortable bed quiet and restful,1
 nothing,0
 it was very luxurious the staff were really friendly and the door man made you feel very special would definitely recommend it it was great location too and easy to get into london by underground ,1
 rooms and bathrooms,0
 everything amazing the 18th floor sky bar is a must for anyone staying at the hotel the room the staff the facilities everything this hotel is amazing ,1
 cost treatment by staff quality of room poor breakfast quality,0
 i couldn t actually like anything as my partner checked in and was told we had been moved to a sister hotel down the road the entrance was more like a budget hostel the room was so tiny the bed was against the wall so we had to climb over each other to get out after a sleepless night we selected the table in the basement breakfast room with the least damp coming through the wall absolutely disgusted at our treatment ,0
 great location for west end and covent garden excellent welcoming staff and very comfortable i feel at home when i come here ,1
 poor or no ventilation window into day light arc filld with vent duct and noise from air cond unit they should not be allowed to sell rooms like number 006 ,0
 great location rooms were nice and quiet staff were friendly and couldn t have done any more to make me happy ,1
 the fact that we were not informed that we were paying good money to stay on a building site there was and still is until august they hope a major refurbishment taking place were you aware of that the dirt noise inconvenience and general chaos is totally unacceptable the entrance to the hotel is now hidden down a side street and we only found it thanks to the maitre d of a nearby restaurant there is only one working lift servicing 8 floors which is rated to carry four people but only if they are super slim and have no luggage with them in addition to which it was quite evident that the housekeeping staff were jamming the doors open from time to time for their own convenience the room was properly serviced and cleaned only once during our stay and on one occasion it took three phone calls over a 1 hour period to obtain a missing second bath towel and a bath mat why they had been taken away in the first place remains a mystery ,0
 the room was not clean everywhere was dust on the furniture,0
 the bedroom suite was luxurious quiet and comfortable and the bathroom with it s twin sinks and sit down shower was absolutely wonderful i couldn t fault it and i am extremely fussy ,1
 the room was not the one advertised on booking com when we complained to reception about this they did nothing our room was right next to the underground train track and the noise levels was awful this also was not mentioned in the booking com ad again the staff on reception did nothing about getting us another room some of the staff had poor english and knew nothing about local area we spent 4 weeks in europe staying at all sorts of hotels and this one was by far the worst we had come across ,0
 i left my glasses in the room and was told they couldn t find it i put it on bedside table before breakfast then checked out staff not very helpful and no compensation offered poor customer service ,0
 the location is perfect you can even walk there from gare du nord the lobby bar restaurant is good for business meetings i had a luxury room which was well proportioned by parisian standards ,1
 its a froughtster hotel when you arrive they charge you per car park per day 35 i stayed in 80 countries a round the world and never has being charged for car park same breakfast in this hotel charged extra30 staff demanded tips demanded ,0
 the staff made us feel very welcome upon our arrival and we only had to wait 10minites for our room to be ready the room was lovely and quiet facing the courtyard the facilities in the room were great and we especially liked the big shower ,1
 accomadation staff service poor quality of room,0
 nearly everything was wrong room very poor half eaten food on a try outside our room door as we went in drilling fire alarm kept going off shower barley any water very very poor allround,0
 hotel portrayed to be 4 and luxurious upon arrival staff very rude and wanting dates of birth for what reason long wait to book in room was supposed to be upgraded to luxurious it was one of the smallest rooms if have ever stayed in only 3 4 bed and up against a window this was the worst hotel i have ever booked in london i thought i would pay a bit more rather than staying in a premier in next time i will be back in the premier inn,0
 the atmosphere and the architecture of the building comfortable room nice bathroom with a great shower ,1
 the room was clean tidy and comfortable though rather small the shower was great nice size tv ,1
 bed really comfy staff very attentive one gave us a tour of the ballroom as we were looking through the window as she walked past lovely decor and really comfortable will definitely stay again,1
 looker in room not working table in room broken careless from the staff overall condition very bad it can not be a 4 star hotel,0
 first of all there was a mouse in my room how is that for 5 star hotel then the breakfast was rather poor some things barely edible and clearly far from fresh my room wasn t clean when i checked in even though at 11pm i had to wait for half an hour for the room to be prepared ,0
 the hassel we gone through before check in was not good at all we waited 3 4 hours only gor check in despite we have booked everything before hand ,0
 location of the hotel is fantastic the hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful the room was massive particularly considering its location in london the breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around london ,1
 bed very comfy,1
 the bedsheets stinks housekeeping service was very poor starting from the cleanliness of the room to the hygiene of bathroom s towels the receptionists have the worst attitude and when i ordered eggs for breakfast they said they ran out of salt pepper ,0
 the staff was absolutely inattentive i was there during the flood and in spite of being june it was very cold i asked why the heating was not working and they answered it had been already put only on cooling cause it was june but they will ask no one ever answered and i did freeze in my bedroom for 4 nights ,0
 really dirty floor rug bad toilet vad flush ,0
 poor quality room not worth what was paid ,0
 central position very close to tube station elegant building in a quiet area good breakfast,1
 good location good staff very comfortable ,1
 wifi didn t work no ar conditioner in the room no value for money,0
 the staff were wonderful and like all hotels sometimes too busy but service was excellent ,1
 comfortable room bed and bathroom spacious wardrobe room robes and slippers friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfast location is perfect as well ,1
 great staff,1
 this hotel would have been nice 30 years ago but has been in steady decline ever since the furnishings and rooms are dated and tired the staff unfriendly and unwilling lack of attention to detail e g the back doors connecting to paddington station were locked early in the morning meaning that guests had to walk out the front of the hotel and around to access the hotel this defeated the purpose of staying close to the station overall disappointing and dissatisfying ,0
 almost everything except the room size bed and bathroom ,0
 customer service very poor uncomfortable bed dirty bathroom neighbours next door was very loud and rude ,0
 the staff were great and the hotel was very clean,1
 room very small even no space for our luggage bath room small with no ventilation,0
 poor value for money very dated room some problems on check in ,0
 food was not good at all have to pay room service for water,0
 elemis products and it was v clean comfy and central location ,1
 lovely setting very nice polite staff rooms nice an comfy direct link to o2 is fab,1
 excellent location and good value for money,1
 the rooms are very narrow the toilet is in a different location than the bath area and no sink with the toilet to wash your hands they don t provide tooth paste and brush set as complementary gesture like other hotels ,0
 the walls are wafer thin when you want to catch up with the news at night your next door neighbour will come knocking on your door house keeping is quite sloppy for the rates they are charging ,0
 the service was bad and i found a mouse in the room,0
 really good location staff very helpful ,1
 the room wasn t available when we arrived once we did check into our room the shower flooded door knob broke off,0
 hotel is incredibly tired and needs refurbishment the hall stunk of old cigarette smoke on a non smoking floor basic toiletries e g shower cap body lotion not provided i left my room one day at 9am and returned at 4pm to find that the room had still not been serviced ,0
 friendly staff spacious room good location good restaurant ,1
 excellent in wvery way,1
 hotel in great location 4th visit to hotel ,1
 room dreadful,0
 ac was hot around 25 5 26 c degree unable to adjust lower bed room was facing the dining room only one upper floor different easily seen thru while the lights on we can watch them eating too cups mugs were not cleaned on the 1st day no serious attention to guests request almost late to airport the small taxi came while we ordered a mini van ,0
 tiny facility bed surrounded by walls tiny shower bad smell in bathroom not clean we found a broken glass and dirty kleenex behind the bed ,0
 my shirt got covered in the hand cream in the downstairs toilets it squirted all over my top as that s the way the dispenser sends it the hotel said it was not their fault and would not knock anything off my bill ralph lauren top damaged ,0
 the location of the hotel is ok,0
 employees,0
 dark room too warm with an early train to europe i was offered a packed breakfast this was not ready and took far too long making me late the staff were most unhelpful the breakfast consisted of an apple an orange a dry roll and a childs fruit drink if that is your standard i hope i never find myself in a hilton hotel ever again again certainly the worst and most expensive hotel in a 20 day rail journey from london to china,0
 very quiet comfortable room good value for money comfortable room good location near tube station for exploring london,1
 the staff could not have been more obliging i arrived direct from australia was seriously unwell they are definitely worth more than 5 5 for sevice ,1
 i got absolutely nothing to complain about this hotel booked a club room big space very clean room great location the staff there is very friendly and helpful ,1
 very discourteous staff except people at the front desk rooms too small beds uncomfortable housekeeping and service staff rude,0
 evrything,0
 the whole hotel was unbelievable every single staff member treated us like we were celebrities will be returning many times to this hotel ,1
 everything to old worst bed shower over bath always dangerous here particularly so because the shower curtain yes really is to long so you risk standing on it and slipping breakfast canned fruit is so close to the toaster it s hot coffee terrible but that s a british thing interesting no english staff made me wonder what they will do after brexit closes the door cause it appears the brits not interested in hospitality ,0
 the staff at breakfast stood around leaning on wall staring at you eating it was a small room felt uncomfortable the shower gel had been topped up with water from previous guests the gel was on bottom water on top bathroom too small no shower curtain everything got wet television badly positioned couldnt see anything unless you stood up luggage room unsafe was given key to take it down ourselves and had access to anyone s case that was in there on returning it was a different person who without question just handed us the key to get our luggage not very security conscious cleaning staff bringing the new towels etc outside rooms ready for later from 7 am not quiet bags of sheets towels etc left opened on stairs for anyone to trip on there was a note in room not to eat in room due to expensive furnishings getting ruined it was cheap mdf flat pack and wooden floor white sheets and a thick throw i ve stayed in 5 hotels that have never asked this if anything it s encouraged in room service there missing a trick ,0
 the italian restaurant coz there is party on weekend music will be very loud people will be loud until late nite the noise it s under renovation there was drilling hammering as early as 8 30 very loud and we weren t being notified warned about it at all they could have told us or slipped a note through our door told us when we checked in even email us disappointed we stayed for a week the renovation work goes on the whole week stay away if you want some quiet moments the toilet door it opens outward and there is nothing you can keep it opened it bangs loud if you miss to hold it the room make up service there is none do not disturb sign for you to hook none such kind of light to switch on the staff ran into our room with his her key while we were still sleeping at 0800 and he she banged the door shut without saying a word that could be a very bad embarrassing scenario ,0
 great location 5 mins walk to the london eye,1
 horrible bathroom,0
 the room was so small for two people my husband and i had to pivot around the room very dark insufficient light no storage for suitcases bathroom so small no place where to put cosmetics mine were on the window sill ,0
 fab location lovely rooms most of the staff were very helpful would definitely stay again ,1
 excellent ,1
 great place nice staff thank you for housekeeping too room was cleaned every day to perfection ,1
 the hotel is conveniently located a one minute walk from the station but far enough away from the main road to ensure no noise at night being opposite hyde park was also an advantage there are plenty of services located nearby shops restaurants atms we wanted olde english d cor and we got it ,1
 i was accompanying my daughter for an audition and she had forgot to print something off that she required the reception staff let her use their computer and printer and saved the day ,1
 the best hotel in london the staff were very accomodating wifi is ok ,1
 i have been staying in many bw hotels and this is probably the worst i was the last one to check in and i got the last room available 009 which is facing the road hendon way the room is not very well insulated so you hear cars passing by every seconds super noisy staff aneil tried to help us moving to a different room but at the end he could not do anything electrical issue apparently i have been waiting almost for an hour from 00 45am to 1 45am despite aneil s kindness no solution has been provided also no hear plugs were available in the morning alberto duty manager apologised again and he offered me breakfast which i did not want or 20 discount of 98 which i think it is not enough if you are staying in for 7hours with no sleep if you really want to stay at this bw please avoid rooms facing the road ,0
 the hotel charged the payment twice on the card we checked in with and then another card we used when checked out with final bill contacted hotel a few times but hotel is reluctant to refund us even though we showed our bank statements this has caused us time and hassles to try and sort out this unnecessary issue which caused by hotel lack of efficiency and good service by hotel is out of line will be seeking legal advice if necessary ,0
 everything was perfect especially the italian restaurant where the food was outstanding everyone were extremely nice and helpful and i mean everyone ,1
 location staff,1
 unable to get an answer from the hotel telephone to revise my reservation and so forfeiting my payment but in particular with using booking com who did not help in resolving the issue which was in minutes of making the reservation through booking com who reserved two rooms under different conditions as advertised maybe a very small part of this was my error but still not acceptable ,0
 location and price,1
 the bed was amazing and the room was well worth the money loved the surprise cake for my partner that was put in the room prior to us arriving can t fault this hotel ,1
 friendly staff great breakfast,1
 we arrived at 8 30am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in london great although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however not sure they should have charged us extra given the view i think if you are going to charge an extra 30 pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view but we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from us ,1
 it is a beautiful hotel full of old charm and character beds comfortable showers hot wifi works well plus you receive a complimentary handy phone to use during your stay this can be taken with you around london and can be used for internet and local calls for free hotel vey close to underground stations and plenty of restaurants and shops around the corner on queensway to grab a bite to eat would highly recommend this hotel ,1
 everything,0
 we went there with tired and cod but the staff in the reception processed very slow and insists to advertise and flattery me a updated room for extra fees the air condition always makes weird noises and can t be shut down suffer it a lot,0
 immaculate hotel although not finished staff were very helpful and happy avery perfect place to stay,1
 the blond young receptionist on arrival was not a welcoming one the shower is small we had a triple room for two people which was already not big so not sure about the standard room london is overpriced as always ,0
 the room was so so small and not clean i requested an extra blanket and there was no respond from the reception or the room service ,0
 every thing,0
 everything,0
 small room not so pleasent staff room had a weird smell didn t smell fresh had to look at 2 other rooms because the first room we was in was so small it s ridiculous ,0
 pretty good hotel and a very convenient location to commute from heathrow and to the centre of london friendly staff and comfortable bed i have been there many times in the past years also with my family and we all like it there ,1
 too old building the steps of the upper level sound too much because of the floor material wood i stay at room 017,0
 i booked this hotel but i was told to stay shaftesbury metoloporis which is 5 mins walk from the hotel because their hot water was not working they arranged complementary taxi and breakfast for us but the reason i booked shaftsbury premier london paddington is because it s closer to the station even the room charge is more expensive than shaftesbury metolopolis the deluxe double room was extremely small hall way is super narrow and there are steps and doors that make us very hard to walk with luggage a green light on the ceiling bothered us whole night moreover when i was checking out at metolopolis i saw the guests are told to stay other hotels because this hotel now has a hot water problem i felt so weird ,0
 cleanliness comfort,1
 they changed the room at first registration and rooms were awful i will never stay at that hotel again,0
 facilities we stayed there as a group and the hotel doesn t have lift so we carry our big bags all the way to our room by stairs in second floor and i asked the reception if they can help us and her answer just no ,0
 beds were really comfy lovely cake left for birthday treat without charge fabulous views children welcome at certain times in spa pool which was fab lovely to be able to get straight into hotel after concert at o2 great stay will be going back ,1
 rude staff room not ready at 3 30 pm request early check in and late check out not accept ,0
 dirty uncomfortable furniture ,0
 everything room was compact not value for money no sufficient coffee making facility there was no milk for coffee when we asked they just brought one small tub promised to give more which never appeared ,0
 1st room was 8th floor tiny lift to room disgusting decor peeling wall paper and stains on bedding and carpet asked to move rooms and were given a room just as awful was told we had to pay more for a better room when we had already paid 206 for one night ,0
 not good attitude and respect,0
 staff was too rude when i have asked about the internet he even told me if i do not like i can write my complaints to internet blogs ,0
 staff didn t want to listen everything was at a extra cost rip off hotel ,0
 friendly staff breakfast very good lots of choice very quiet and comfy room,1
 the lobby and communal rooms are beautiful and provide a fantastic environment to chill out in ,1
 very small room ,0
 service and history ,1
 looked like a room from the 1970s dim and dismal decor old utility furniture filthy windows looked out onto a service shaft extremely poor value for mopney i stay every few weeks in london usually closer to west end either charing cross or horseguards all are about the same price and infinitely nicer places to stay tv was tiny and no remote housekeeping brought us a spare ,0
 the elevator was broken and no other choices services were not good,0
 great amenities and very clean room good base for us to visit all the tourist sites nothing exceptional about this place but great value for the price if you compare to other accommodation in paris ,1
 no lift and no offer of compensation for trekking up 3 flights of stairs with luggage room key card then didn t work when we got to room at night even though not been kept by mobile phone breakfast staff were rude didn t acknowledge us until we asked to be sat down didn t listen to our order so brought coffee not tea cooked breakfast was cheap food that had sat for a long time and was one of worst hotel breakfasts id ever had put us off hiltons,0
 the location was wonderful although our cab driver had a hard time finding it the bed was pretty hard other than that it was great loved the heated bathroom floor ,1
 when we checked in the first room was smelly then it took an hour before the hotel can allocate another room for us and when we finally checked into the family room there weren t enough big towels for 4 pax in the room the hotel staff said they ran out of big towels mmmm,0
 no ac no mirror no shelf in shower closet much too small ,0
 wonderful full breakfast and friendly staff ,1
 booked a superior room but was allocated a club room no explanation given,0
 location was fantastic and the staff team were attentive and helpful,1
 room was so awful smallest i ve ever stayed in 200 for the pleasure,0
 room building worrk,0
 the restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger good breakfast with fresh orange juice wifi in all hotel,1
 very comfy clean and modern room friendly forward polite pleasant and professional staff always on hand and happy to help,1
 staff very helpful,1
 really nice building but lots of building work going off but only outside so not a problem good size rooms fairly modern good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram wifi worked perfectly and quickly ,1
 comfortable bed and the hotel worked with me to ensure i had a shower and ease of access to my room staff were helpful room service prompt and food adequate but not exciting ,1
 booked to stay at this hotel because it has air conditioning for a long bank holiday weekend on both of the days of our stay it wasn t working our room for most of the day and night was nearly 30 degrees its fair to say we did not have a good weekend in london ,0
 view from the room was amazing and the staff were very helpful and friendly,1
 convenient for the tube ,1
 staff and location,1
 roomy clean good location friendy staff,1
 great location great buffet great staff decent price we highly recommended the grande royale ,1
 clean rooms very friendly staff nice breakfast,1
 i was expecting better,0
 the staff said they can book us a taxi if told in advance thennwhen we chose to utilise this service i was told no they don t book taxis the hotel is horribly overpriced for the state it was in we got a broken chipped glass with our breakfast and they forgot our toast we waited30 mins for toast and then it came and was the wrong type we asked for white but got brown very old fashioned hotel worn out furniture and dusty toilet seat in the bathroom we will never stay there again,0
 everything is poor,0
 cyn ann on reception was such a star helped me sort tickets for gig i d forgotten to print at home all staff very friendly great stay thank you,1
 the extremely friendly and helpful staff the great location the cozy room ,1
 excellent deluxe room,1
 the impressions made by the website arrival into the lobby public areas set you up for high expectations unfortunately it falls flat once you head upstairs the corridors are dark dusty despite a hoover being left in the corridor with the cables all over the floor causing a porential trip hazzard further disappointed in the bedroom a small box with a platform bed surrounded on 3 sides by walls glass up one end no space to walk around so you have to clamber up over the bed the way it is set up there is only one bedside light no windows to open you have to keep the blinds curtains down for privacy causing more of a claustrophobic feeling the shower unit is more like a steam room as soon as you take a shower causing the toilet paper towels to become damp cold water dripping from the roof on top of this the room had not been dusted properly with dust on the glass shelves mirror the room was not at all inviting or enticing to stay in no matter how much gadgetry there is oh check your docking station when cleaning the room so that the ipad is charged enough to operate the room facilities ,0
 good and convenient location staff service was good money worth ,1
 lovey staff very attentive ,1
 very friendly and accommodating staff ,1
 the hotel is dirty and furniture garbage old fashioned the service is not good at all the reception is very badly treated the prices are very expensive room,0
 the rooms are tiny and although they have done their best to try and manoeuvre around that s it s just way to claustrophobic there is no where to hang clothes or put bags no where to sit and relax and absolutely no window in the room or the bathroom moreover the bedding was not up to a good standard all that was provided was a very thin 1 pills and sheets that felt plasticy furthermore the bar closes very early i believe 10 30 pm for soho so if you want any tea coffee or alcoholic beverage you have to go to soho to get it just not good enough,0
 good location charming edwardian style building and decor good breakfast for 12 if you booked it the night before instead of the quoted 15 ,1
 the room suited my children perfectly and made sure we had a relaxing night sleep staff were so welcoming to us all especially my children my son was greeted with birthday gifts in our room which he was over the moon about can t rate this hotel highly enough ,1
 good location,1
 i loved everything from the great location to the excellent staff and facilities and the outstanding restaurant would definitely recommend this hotel ,1
 the net curtains were filthy there were mice in the wall and window box and i couldn t wait to get out of there staff would not do me a packed lunch instead of breakfast really unhelpful would not stay there again ,0
 very grubby room dirty stained carpet old dirty light switches noise from upstairs all night and next door rooms no shower curtain or screen in the bathroom broken loo seat broken hot tap,0
 location sofa bed microwave cutlery staff kids play area washing machine at the basement was all helpful as we were travelling with toddlers and stayed 4 nights size of studio king room was great for family of 2 2 young kids ,1
 breakfast facilities were awful general standard lower than i would expect,0
 i got some clothes washed and it cost 65 for 3 shirts my card stopped working on a regular basis ,0
 this is definitely not a four star hotel dirty toilet stained carpet brown peeling wallpaper v narrow beds heating stayed on all night at 27 degrees no air con the bedroom window wouldn t open we eventually had to call housekeeping at 01 00hrs to open it but still no air came in an unattended suitcase left on landing despite me telephoning down for it to be looked at security threat overnight parking is 21 00 no reduction for residents you pay the same as man on the street crowded breakfast dining room with tatty seats rusty windows unfriendly staff unappetising food fatty undercooked bacon over ripe fruit general poor selection of food and display unfriendly staff treated us as inconvenience rather than guests dirty breakfast table leisure facilities which are not as good as they appear in photos shut at 16 00hrs we had not be informed that this would happen when we booked we has specifically booked hotel for spa facility however looking at the murky state of the pool we probably wouldn t have risked entering that or any spa facility they provided for risk of infection we upgraded to an excutive room with the promise of a view and was given a view of a rubbish dump in one direction and a building site in the other photos can be provided but they are not pleasant to look at i did bring all these points up with manager both at the beginning and end of our stay and received a very basic apology i got the feeling that manager felt if i didn t like it bad luck there was no offer of a part refund to compensate for our unpleasant stay i doubt if anything will change it was a very very disappointing stay and i would not stay there again ,0
 needs a drastic update rooms very tired not very clean no free wifi in rooms ,0
 the location is wonderful if you like to spend time in the latin quarter which i do great restaurants in the area close to notre dame cathedral plenty of rer metro stops in case you don t want to walk or would like to get over to the eiffel tower or champs elysee i am on my first around the globe trip which means i ve been on the road for while so the laundromat right on the next block also gave me the opportunity to run a load of laundry for 6 euros rather than the ridiculous fee a hotel would charge ,1
 clean modern decent size rooms with awesome bathroom ,1
 the hotel was esquisite and staff was extremely pleasant and helpful we very much enjoyed the substantial buffet breakfast it is less than a block from the russell square tube station ,1
 i knew it was a small room but it was really no more than a cupboard i am only 1 63m and i could just about touch both sides of the room also i could hardly turn around in the shower it was also far too hot and even with a fan provided by reception i had a poor nights sleep ,0
 rooms are so small and when we asked the staff to change the room the answer is that we do not have anything to do ,0
 the price plus the attitude of the staff i landed in the night around 1am and guy asked me to prepay for first night the machine didn t work the first time and he immediately said that he can t give me the room though the issue was with his machine card worked in the 2nd attempt though but he created panic and asked immediately to leave very horrible experience ,0
 the room and ensure were disgusting,0
 location and quality of facilities,1
 noisy hotel walls made of paper breakfast 6 10am not much left after 8am only one lift working,0
 staff were all very attentive and polite special thanks to bar staff for treating us so well ,1
 too noisy and unhelpful staff would not stay again if i wanted a good night s sleep ,0
 dirty and too expensive for what it was ,0
 breakfast,1
 the first room they gave us had a small double bed which had wall against it top bottom and side only suitable for 1 person you would have to climb over each other to get out we were moved to a better room the air conditioning kept turning off automatically it was the hottest night of the year we had friends staying in another room and they had the same problem with the air conditioning,0
 awful misrepresentation of their fitness room room was smaller than 3 square metres and only has 2 cross trainers ,0
 reception wasn t good place i didn t like their responding the lobby was quite small there were no television in there anybody doesn t help you to carry your luggage and show your way the escalator was horrible it was like an service escalator only two persons can enter in it esclator doesn t go to your level you have to climb the stairs with your luggage coridor of flat was very narrow there was no refrigerator in your room if you want anything your room they don t bring you there is no room service they say you come and take yourself the tv shows only french channels the breakfast was insufficient i didn t understand how this hotel rated 8 2 points l defently don t suggeste this hotel for staying,0
 excellent location for seeing a show,1
 one particular member of staff a trainee lady is rude inconsistant with information and dismisive i also dont like the fact that when you book a smoking room they try and charge you extra ,0
 the decoration was shabby cigarette butts left outside the window sill rubbish in street outside stingy with toiletries had to ask for shower gel staff not particularly welcoming overpriced for what you get ,0
 all staff were friendly and helpful in all parts of the hotel we had to change our plans to eat out and switch to the hotel restaurant this was sorted with ease the hotel restaurant wasn t the most atmospheric but the food was lovely as was the service room very well eqipped and comfortable scrambled eggs at breakfast were actually the texture of creamy scrambled eggs almost unheard of for hotel breakfasts great location for south and central london,1
 breakfast offers a very good choice if food location of hotel was great good restaurant s next door,1
 book a room that comes with access to the club lounge the club lounge offers a continental breakfast free water soda wine and beer throughout the day and sandwiches and fruit during the afternoon the coffee machine makes the best lattes along with a variety of other types of coffees and hot chocolate this lounge really made the stay for us ,1
 very bad smell in hallway lots of little moths in room and wifi did not work in our area of the hotel worked fine in others ,0
 very very poor and old room and the hotel charged me twice and i didn t get the refund till now,0
 although i don t think the room was worth what i paid it was a very basic cheap looking room and definitely wasn t worth 200 a night ,0
 staff very nice hotel quite clean,1
 every thing exept the staff,0
 staff always helpful,1
 we liked the bar and the food in the bar the staff were very helpful when we arrived late and we ate in the bar area ,1
 excellent staff service couldn t be more helpful room was very clean with amazingly comfortable bed breakfast buffet was incredible wide range of cooked and uncooked food excellent hotel ,1
 receptionist from italy sorry i forgot her name she s very nice to us saying welcome to london and to the property she also upgraded our room with a fantastic view of the big ben and londoneye during our 4 nights stay ,1
 the location was excellent and staff very helpful ,1
 the room was smelly and filthy with mould in the bathroom we arrived after dark and couldn t see the filth because of the appalling lighting until morning we will not go again ,0
 comfortable beds,1
 the location is great very friendly helpfull staff,1
 the location was terrible i expected more from the novotel brand i was very disappointed we booked and paid for 3 nights and left after one i have never felt so unsafe in my life ,0
 great hotel chain ideal situation for access to city very helpful staff even after the stay ,1
 almost everything when arrived at reception 2 working women non of them event told me hello welcome one minute please ignore me for a few minutes until one of them was ready to take care of me nice gym room but not included and even not possible to charge the room nice spa but not included and even not possible to charge the room free wifi but only 20 minutes breakfast not inclued i saw it and it was very poor did even not want to have it in extra also need to be refreshed too hot room with only vent or heating run away ,0
 i asked to only pre authorize my credit card as i was going to pay whole accommodation and extras on cash they said ok but they finally charged my card as they said by mistake i requested to have my shirts ironned but they told me that they do not offer this facility and that i should do it by myself as i had an iron and ironboard in my room despite the fact that inside the room they had a laundry list including a price for ironing shirts for a 4 hotel they had no bathrobes slippers bathroom amenities only shampoo shower gel and soap felt that i should use them very carefully as they would have not replace them if run out in the room food is average 4 00 sterling for room service charge are they serious better say i don t want to offer this service do not order reception staff did not give any information upon check in e g available restaurants breakfast hours e t c i even had to ask for directions to my room ,0
 great location friendly staff gave us an upgrade which included s free breakfast ,1
 clean rooms quiet location but close to stations,1
 being upgraded due to air con problem,1
 lie,0
 great location,1
 room size was very small the bed cover was full of dust small tv bathroom and toilet were in two different rooms their resteraunt is not open 24 7 and when we ordered from a resteraunt to deliver at the hotel they charged us 20 euros ,0
 the room was a good size with sofa and it was clean and comfortable the breakfast buffet which was included in the room rate offered lots of choice including cooked or fruit cereal etc ,1
 the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble the location of the hotel is perfect for visiting london s attractions and there are plenty of places to eat nearby ,1
 the room was clean toiletries were stocked,1
 a room without a window thus more a box on a noisy corridor with noisy airconditioning system and a horrible white light fixture is it too much trouble for the reception staff to address their customers rather than mumbling instructions credit card sign here and all of the above for 190 pounds night ,0
 central location,1
 amazing big room exellent viewing very clean and the restaurant is nice,1
 bathroom extractor fan didn t work only half the bathroom lights worked only one tv channel worked shower head didnt work reported faults but nothing was done on our return from a wedding on the 2nd night found no faults had been rectified complained to be told maintenance didn t report to work that day was offered an alternative room but being it was midnight it was hardly practicable ,0
 comfy bed great location great restaurant,1
 i had changed rooms three times also on the 18 th march i ordereed pizza waited an hour to be told sorry we run out of pizza so then had to wait another hour to make another jewzl,0
 very handy for the underground,1
 the filth,0
 comfortable bed with clean linnen water boiler in room shower in good order fresh towels the room was ready and we could check in some hours earlier than ordinary check in time thank you ,1
 location staff very helpful room was small but otherwise very good hotel has great atmosphere ,1
 the room was very cold whatever you do please stay away from room 004 it stunks in this room and the heater does not work properly after several hours of no heating the bathroom floor started getting warm the staffs did not come up to check the faulty heater and it seems that they were trying to fix it from the reception it appeared that they knew about this problem they said that they were fully booked and no other rooms were available but i belived it was a lie as it stated that more rooms were available for booking online ,0
 how accommodating the hotel staff were and would bend over backwards to get anything for you ,1
 stained cracked bath and bathroom very tired and jaded indifferent staff overpaid for parking lifts broken roof tiles in bathroom broken and miss fitting clock radio broken a travelodge would have been much better in terms of cleanliness and decor,0
 the location was phenomenal the accommodations were amazing as well ,1
 all hotel facilities used were excellent wide choice for breakfast staff courteous and helpful,1
 staff mostly from oversees were very engaging and accommodating i liked how efficient and organised the staff were in queuing and sitting people for breakfast it was a perfect example of everyone knowing what they were doing i liked the housekeeping service they followed instruction well and appropriately and were discreet and accommodating reception staff were warm,1
 no bar no breakfast no dinner not what you would expect from a member of accor very sub standard,0
 very dark and quiet room perfect for sleep big and nice bathroom ,1
 the whole hotel was poor do not book this hotel ,0
 value for money,1
 comfortable room great location quiet ,1
 really nice smart hotel everything was spotless the staff were lovely the room was perfect we got a free upgrade on arrival the restaurants they have were amazing will definately be returning ,1
 the bed was really comfortable facilities was great location was perfect enjoyed our weekend ,1
 the rooms are old and noisy there was no fridge in my room the bathroom is old i don t think the standard is of a 4 stars hotel probably a 2 stars i will not go back,0
 we were very happy with the room the bed was very comfortable staff were helpful next to the o2 was perfect as we went to see david haye fight ,1
 the breakfast was the best buffet breakfast we have had everything hot and plenty of choice it was great to have water and fruit in the room a nice touch the bedding was lovely duvet really snuggly the pull out mirror in the bathroom really useful ,1
 staff at reception seemed to lack training very slow i had prepaid for my accommodation and did not take anything from the bar fridge yet they had charged me for a drink i did not take i had to request they amend the account i also needed a sewing kit none in room had to request one be sent to the room went downstairs for breakfast and as we didn t want the buffet had to sit in the open area to eat not good on the second morning at about 4 40am everyone was told over the pa system to evacuate the hotel there we were standing out in the street in the drizzle with absolutely no instruction from any hotel staff as to where to stand or what was going on we had to ask the firefighters what was happening ,0
 the quick access through the hotel to the o2 arena were back in our hotel room within 10 minutes of the concert finishing,1
 by far the worst experience i ever had in a hotel i booked this hotel convinced that it was a great deal for the location and the quantity of stars which most of the time equal comfort and relaxation big mistake i was welcomed by an unfriendly and full of attitude staff i had to order three times in order to get a quick breakfast juice and a toast just because it was late 11am and they were getting ready the tables for lunch together with my friend we arrived quite late in the room after a whole day of tourism the room was stuffy smelling of sweat small and with an insect on the bed we complained and they gave us another room bigger but with no heat because they said the ac was broken the linen was rough and unaired and the room seemed like a 3 hotel room than a 5 we were really cold over the night and i personally had the worst sleep in a long time in the morning we tried to ask for some towels and water but we were attended by a staff that were hanging up the phone before even us finishing the sentence over all i would definitely not recommend this hotel ,0
 the rooms were very very small ,0
 excellent hotel came for a concert at the o2 but nothing else seemed to really be around this location,1
 friendly staff and great views over canary wharf and river thames,1
 we ve stayed here before and enjoyed it just as much a second time excellent location near jardins du luxembourg friendly staff tea and coffee in room is a bonus for paris ,1
 upgraded room,1
 queky floor boards,0
 everything was amazing ,1
 fantastic friendly and helpful staff ,1
 best thing about this hotel is the bed it s an absolute dream staff are amazing friendly and very helpful 2nd time staying absolutely love it ,1
 they wouldn t let my boyfriend in the room because he didn t have id they also charged 50 fee on the day i went but not when i payed i wasted 3 hours of my time preparing for a great night and i had to leave by the end of it i was very disappointed,0
 newly renovated rooms are nice airy and fresh bathroom and shower were great good food in hotel restaurant ,1
 breakfast room excellent,1
 a lot of the accomodation is in separate building across the road with no reception the room i was shown to had not been cleaned and bed unmade so taken to basement room where generator right outside window and noisy all night ,0
 service was terrible asked for extra towel reply got was could not get one until 11pm even after which did not get one the kitchen was closed so breakfast was a box with basically freezed food and nothing in it they should have taken with breakfast option from their booking if so ,0
 perfect staff,1
 i have booked a deluxe double room at this hotel and what i got was a dark room in the basement with virtually no window see pictures for prove i never been to a hotel with no window in the bedroom before i asked at the reception for a different room but they refused to give me one for a 4 star hotel this is an absolute impudence so if you still plan to stay at this hotel make sure in advance that you are getting a room 1st floor or above and not in the basement ,0
 freezing room and despite frequent requests for staff to turn up heating it remained freezing no extra blankets provided despite requests the original room was so small i would hardly have been able to turn round in it staff did upgrade me to a larger room on request,0
 location and room,1
 not a suite more or less just a small room toilet on different level old and grubby more decor net curtains a disgrace grey and never been washed ,0
 room was small but very adequate liked the nice touch of having some fruit in the room ,1
 excellent hotel with exceptional staff ,1
 room wasn t smelling pleasant small customary things like complimentary sugar coffee packet wasn t there in the room at such high tariff breakfast should have been included ,0
 location close to hyde park makes it a perfect spot for running staff is always ready to help and show great care this fully refurbished with modern comfort whilst they keep the historical london touch at reception great choice,1
 staff were friendly and very helpful very impressed that we were afforded an upgrade which was appreciated as we had booked months in advance buffet breakfast more than adequate and restaurant foyer in evening provided seating and food for guests wanting a smaller meal also staying in hotel conceirage secured baggage during the day of departure while we were out ,1
 comfy room with reasonable extras needed a shower cap tho as shower didn t lower control was on bath tap ,1
 nice breakfast marvelous stayed there at my london trip for three days with free breakfast lucky me romantic architecture at the breakfast room ,1
 i stayed at the hotel for 4 nights this is definitely an exceptional hotel the staff is amazing no other words to describe their hospitality outstanding room indulging bathroom and amenities location is beautiful nearby kensington palace and kensington park definitely i ll come again,1
 the shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the 2nd evening of our 2 night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon the room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the 3 occasions we complained about the shower we were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted this was never done i was also given a discount card and told i could use this for a 5 discount on the hotel bar and restaurants when i purchased a rum and ginger at the bar i was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full 9 90 for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly 10 ,0
 complimentary water in the room ,1
 ideal location quiet and very comfy beds and excellent air con during heatwave,1
 the enormous garden is a rare treat in london,1
 limited space and work space facility temperamental air con lack of natural light ,0
 the rooms are unwelcoming the bathroom was at least clean and fairly modern the reception lulls you into a false sence of security and appears the the rest of the accommodation will be as tranquil it wasn t the breakfast continental choice was mediocre at best tables very cramped and you almost feel your sitting on top of other guests ,0
 the bed was fine breakfast so much choice and well presented the chef went out of his way to provide me with two fried eggs for breakfast ,1
 the room is very tiny even the guest can t move and very poor facilities such as a closet,0
 the staff were excellent and couldn t do enough for you the bed was very comfortable and room size was excellent ,1
 it seems that the hotel allocates unrefurbished rooms to booking com travellers following our complaint about the poor state of the room and the fact that the rooms pictured on the internet looked very nice in comparison we were offered to upgrade to much nicer rooms which match those advertised on the internet and on bookong com extremely disappointing ,0
 bed exceptionally comfortable bathroom was beautiful great shower pool and fitness facilities were a brilliant perk after hectic travelling ,1
 good location clean hotel room sheets bathroom renovated hotel ,1
 the room and room facilities were very good location to event attending really suited us breakfast provision was excellent very clean nice decor,1
 1 very disappointed with the signposting to the property we drove around and up down the a40 until we had to stop and call for directions into the entrance even then we were told by the receptionist to drive to the small street which i gather meant a side street even then the signposts were so small it was difficult to enter at the right place 2 the floors in the room were laminate and not carpet which were very noisy 3 whilst in the shower 2 people entered our room they were issued with the same room keys as us room 213 thankfully we were in the room as they entered however we had valuables with us and had we already gone out as was the reason for our stay it could ve been a different storey as there was no safe in the room 4 no towel rail apart from 2 hooks in the shower not impressed at all ,0
 super been before would go again,1
 the restaurant was phenomenal the belgian restaurant was sensational a little pricey but worth the money ,1
 the room 88 was too hot no windows to open for any air no air conditioning either there was a water cooler however room temperature was soaring high and there was damp smell in the room,0
 staff really helpful clean and tidy,1
 hotel rooms too small and basic not at all like it was advertised on the web meals very poor had to send breakfast back on two days as only barely warm fire alarm went off both nights no explanation from staff or phone call to advise why would not recommend this hotel,0
 oldish bath door demolished curtains terrible room cupboard terrible too too expensive ,0
 the apartment generally,0
 bathroom wasn t clean sky sports 1 didn t work room needed maintenance,0
 my major problem with this hotel was that the wifi in my room only worked in a small corner close to the door this meant i had to work at the desk and type emails and do my business and then take my laptop and stand in the small corner until all my emails sent and updates were done reception suggested i move to another room but that room was smaller with no work desk and really not what i paid for i specifically chose this hotel because it has a gym nowhere on their website or in the hotel it shows that the gym is out of order but only when i changed and actually went to the gym there was a notice on the door both these issues gave me such a bad impression of hilton euston london ,0
 good breakfast,1
 staff very friendly rooms spotless very comfy bed,1
 fantastic hotel in a great central location for oxford street and covent garden the staff were very efficient and helpful lovely size twin room very clean ,1
 quiet slept well,1
 marvellous staff,1
 excellent location near hyde park queensway little shops and restaurants rail stations hotel itself nice and quaint ,1
 the view was amazing staff were wonderful,1
 not as in photos at all the owners own several hotels on the same street we ended up a good walk away up 3 flights of narrow and steep stairs despite asking for a disabled room for my mother they house homeless people and down and outs in the same building the rooms on this site are only in one building comprising of 5 rooms the chances of you getting what you think you are getting is extremely low it was vile there were mice dishes and cutlery still had stale food on them a cupboard fell on my head a double mattress on a single bed base still charged for a double the shower was rusty and had soap on the screen and the tiles one towel had a mysterious brown skid mark no plug for the sink dirty wall everything covered in dust hairs on all of the sheets and 4 of our pillows only one pillow per person no clean towels one in a dusty bag at the bottom of the wardrobe clearly not washed windows wouldn t open no vent for the shower so fire alarm went off though there was no alarm on our floor could hear it downstairs the staff came in and out of our room without knocking we couldn t lock the room to stop them from the inside windows were dirty and wouldn t open told to clean it all myself by extremely rude staff the owner said if the beds were made then he didn t care about the other issues smelled of cigarettes drunks lay in the street and filled the park outside go round the corner and find another place for a similar price there are a few and save the upset and distress we have had never ever been treated like such a degraded animal no thought even given to our children forced to stay in such a disgrace if we could ve we d have left as soon as we arrived ,0
 i had a terrible experience and have since tried several times to contact the manager who has failed on each time to get back in touch with me on my first night i was woken up at 1 45 in the morning by a loud alarm going off outside my room i had to phone reception to inform them to turn it off it came on again later on in the night and completely disrupted my sleep i woke up late and tired and was so upset by the previous nights events i didn t want to eat breakfast so went out to a cafe instead on route to my meeting the following morning i was due to travel back to devon and was very upset to find no hot water whatsoever in the shower none one in the hotel explained or apologised to me and i later overheard the receptionist say that someone was going to come and fix it later that day i would like a part refund but this hotel isn t responding please help ,0
 staff,0
 there was heavy construction works going on in the hotel from the early hours of friday all throughout the day and from ver early on monday morning this was very disrupting to us as it woke us up very early and was a source of constant irritation this should have been communicated before we booked as we would not have stayed here had we known we found this very disturbing the staff were clearly under huge pressure as they were receiving multiple complaints from staff and as a result not giving the customers good service ,0
 there was no water for two days and no staff to tell us when the problem was going to be resolved ,0
 everything went pretty bad horrible old and smelling hotel ugly rooms and high rates the m nager on duty has no respect for the guests overall 2 stars hotel absolutely not 5 ,0
 bed was great air conditioning was great,1
 very poor service not helpful at all ,0
 i was very un happy with the stay as we gilt mislaid and paid for a deluxe room and there was not one thing deluxe about it was just the same as any standard premier inn,0
 nice hotel in a great location next to luxembourg gardens and the pantheon and 5 mins walk to center of saint michel the hotel also has lovely little balconies overlooking the rooftops so i recommend you get a room on the top floors ,1
 this was supposed to be a 4 star hotel but this was one of my worst experiences ever the room appliances shower etc were totally outdated smelly some things not working the room i was assigned was missing a tv a hanger for the tv was there but the tv was missing i changed then to another room the room had not even place for a chair and was missing basics that even a hostel has as a hook to hang something or a lights switch near bed or a light close to the bed the shared shower had only cold water the tap was falling down and this had nothing to do with me not knowing how to use it rude excuse from the reception internet too slow to check even and email very bad breakfast for a 4 start hotel no real juice very few choices i was offered to pay an extra on top of the extra breakfast cost to get something warm the plugs are old and unlike other international hotels do not fit eu plugs without an uk adapter personal at the reception has bad manners and is not trained avoid this place by all means ,0
 friendly staff comfortable room sparkling clean bathroom stayed for one night on business and feel this is great value for money not the lap of luxury but had everything you need ,1
 everything was amazing staff were excellent and very helpful food was also amazing the view from the room was gorgeous especially at the night ,1
 it was great for us the room was petite and perfect for us its location was great you ve got two station on the next road with a lot of eateries will definitely go back again ,1
 unexpected birthday cake with wine and singing staff at breakfast for my husbands birthday lovely all staff were very friendly polite and smiley ,1
 it wasn t clean at all rooms too small not a 4 stars standard ,0
 location best bed great night sleep,1
 the pool was closed the reception was very slow and unfriendly on both check in and check out the concierge was closed from 6 30pm when we called reception from the room the phone was just left to ring we saw reception also ignoring calls when we were checking out the escalators didn t work the phone chargers in reception didn t work the room was damp with paint coming off the walls the walls were thin and we could hear next door even though they weren t noisy ,0
 perfect location for our morning spent at the british museum ,1
 good location and convenience to approach airport shuttle bus the tourist shuttlebus and shopping mall ,1
 the reception they are very friendly and welcoming,1
 the receptionist wasn t particularly welcoming and was very stern didn t smile however got past that my main disappointment throughout my stay was there was a huge building sight right outside my window which started making loud noises from as early as 5am which i hadn t been told about when i checked in had i of known this i would of purchased a room with no window or on the other side of the building so i actually got some sleep ready for my meeting early the following morning also a member of staff opened my door at 7am and came in waking me up with no apology just quickly slamming the door behind him her hopefully you can offer me something to compensate my not so good stay at your hotel i would really appreciate if this is a possibility ,0
 as guests of the day we were upgraded and given complimentary breakfast ,1
 staff very bad,0
 i was disappointed with many things starting with the lobby tiny reception no lobby to the breakfast area which seats up to 15 people only and seats are cramped with no room to circulate comfortably to the elevator there is 1 small elevator only which does not fit three people with their suitcases when you get out of the elevator on the room floor level it is very dark and the lights do not switch on right away you actually have to walk in the dark for a good few steps which is a risk hazard especially that there is a steep spiral stairs to your right and someone can easily trip over it in the dark not enough light in the room either very small closet i was staying in the superior double room so i was expecting better room was not cleaned properly dirty tea cups were not changed friendly staff though,0
 this hotel was in an excellent location just a minute or two to charles de gaulle metro station from where you could catch a train to any location in paris rooms were beautiful and staff were super friendly and helpful and all spoke excellent english would highly recommend this hotel ,1
 i was slightly apprehensive to come to this place due to some reviews as i always read reviews before i go somewhere due to excitement and curiosity anyway the staff at the front where very friendly and so was every other staff member that i came into contact with the room was beautiful i had asked for a smoking room as my other half smokes but when i went into the room it turned out it was non smoking so i called reception to point out this error they then told me i had been upgraded to an executive room which was fantastic to find out who can complain at being upgraded for free not me that s for sure lol overall me and my boyfriend enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this place ,1
 if you are looking for sightseeing this is the place to stay as everything is close to this hotel the couch became a double bed while we had a king size double bed as well when we walked in everyone was open and started complimenting me and my friends ,1
 the service,0
 the lounge room,1
 best staff i have ever met thank you all ,1
 the location is definitely the main selling point,1
 had to wait 50 mins past check in time for room despite other guests after us getting theirs breakfast wait was awful and tables very crammed noise from heating fan in room very loud ,0
 the ac didn t work at all we suffered for 3 nights then changed rooms breakfast was the same boring thing everyday ,0
 i stayed for one day but they charged for 2 nights in spite of repeated requests staffs in the reception were hostile kindly requesting you to remove that hotel from your list ,0
 very good hotel and nice position very helpfull staff,1
 there were a number of reasons we are giving this review as negative firstly somewhere very close to our room 559 was either a service lift or some sliding doors that were in use all day the noise felt like it was in our room and was impossible to ignore i spoke to the receptionist and she did offer us a move but we were exhibiting at the olympia for four days and simply did not have time morning or night or the energy to change rooms the bathroom was very tatty in places the door had clearly been very wet and was spreading badly at the base areas of tiling etc had been filled and generally it was not what you would expect the queues for breakfast in the mornings were long and the restaurant staff one in particular rather stern for what is obviously a hotel servicing many hundreds of guests attending shows at the exhibition centre all needing breakfast at around the same time this is very poor wi fi connection very poor blocked toilets next to restaurant one day husband reported it and they were still blocked the next day sorry its so long but this was a real disappointment ,0
 the beds were so comfy did not want to get up also the pillows were the best i have slept on in a hotel for along time staff very helpful and polite ,1
 the bed was terrible was like a elephant sleeped there before us they change the bedroom but was the same old crap springy bed needs a huge makeover and new beds in all rooms cheers,0
 the bed amazing the staff gets you what you want calm place,1
 very un friendly staff,0
 the quietness facilities and comfort of the room were great,1
 need to pay wifi that have to be free needed to ask 3 times to have some heat in the room far away from center old hotel old rooms,0
 very clean and tidy staff good location very good,1
 good location good food area nice room friendly staff,1
 breakfast was excellent gym was handy ,1
 anything positive got overshadowed by the bedbugs unacceptable that this type of hotel has bedbugs we have bedbug bites i had one small bite in my hand i thought maybe a mosquito or something the second night when i got home i had a lot more i didn t know what it was and the doctor confirmed bedbugs and explained the bites can show a day after or so my sister and i got it since we slept on the bed my other sisters that slept on the sofa didn t get bitten this is just unacceptable we tried to reach the hotel and they hang up on us very unprofessional ,0
 everything it s is the best hotel i ve ever been to ,1
 ideally close to paddington station,1
 cleanliness awful there were two pair of dirty underwear behind a desk chair obviously housekeeping dies the bare minimum i was revolted bed no mattress pad gross itchy sheets because of my discovery of the underwear when i moved the chair to the desk i was obviously creepiest out fir the rest if my stay staff unfriendly and unhelpful ,0
 the pre show meal in the peninsula restaurant was fantastic the view from the room up the thames was great all staff were very friendly,1
 smooth check in clean room excellent facilities cracking breakfast lovely staff can t fault it perfect for a gig at hammersmith apollo ,1
 for the room lighting not enough very dark carpet too old and quite dirty too smelly door looks loose not secure socket not enough,0
 our room was on the second floor clean quite and very comfy bed the shower was powerful and amazing can t comment on food cause we didn t eat in the hotel location was central next to paddington station and the underground we do recommend the hotel and may use it again in the future ,1
 the garden is really super ,1
 bed was very comfy rooms clean with coffee tea making facilities and ironing board iron ,1
 rooms tired and old plus breakfast beong 16 50 and 14 to park was a rip off ,0
 bed was lovely and comfortable we had an amazing view from the 14th floor the location was brilliant as we went to a show at the o2 arena we had our 5 year old son with us and the staff were brilliant and very friendly would definitely go back again ,1
 extra charged for museum pass and laundry wash 1 the 2 days museum pass sold by the front desk to me for 55 cash i found out and asked a refund for 17 the extra charge when i checked out yesterday 2 i sent 3 polo shirts and 2 cotton pants for laundry it charged for 81 it had 23 over the price that was told by the front desk but it was counted 3 cotton pants on the bill and each pants was charged 13 the charge was wrong because each cotton pants s price is 10 told by the front desk the shower s temperature was very hot and hurt my son at night on 6 25 1 even though i turned the holder to the end of the right side i reported 2 times to the front desk then the staff came to the room for adjusting 2 when he came and turned the holder to end of the right side the temperature suddenly down to cold but the water temperature never turn hot after the adjusted even though turn the holder to the end of left side ,0
 all the staff were polite and welcoming and arranged taxis do my destination as required you never felt second best excellent hotel and staff,1
 amazingly clean well done to the cleaners and maids staff on the whole were so friendly,1
 lights in the room didnt work and they did not fix the problem despite my complain bathroom sink also didnt drain water properly and it took me two complaints to have them do something,0
 terrible room layout which involved enduring a sink in the hallway and a toilet in the shower or was that a shower in the toilet either way it was dirty tiny and horrible the bed was very small yet when i got out of bed i hit my knees on the wall and this was an expensive suite really how does this place get four stars even in manhattan it would only get two in a word terrible ,0
 the above,0
 the room was dirty the bed was against a window on the ground floor of a main road so was very noisy and drafty ,0
 loads of noise from other people in hotel rooms partying in room till 2 am with kids screaming really not good for 180 per night then never got asked if we enjoyed our stay wonder why ,0
 staff friendly and helpful,1
 thought it would be a real treat to stay there but it wasnt excellent location but a tired looking place needs updating and a good clean the lifts were scruffy and curtains were hanging off the rail in reception not a good welcome the toilet in the room was without windows or fan so you could just smell the loo the whole time heating not working so a small portable radiator was placed there just disappointed i would never stay there again cost a lot of money spend your money elsewhere,0
 location and super friendly and helpful staff,1
 room too hot and can t adjust down prevents a good night sleep bed itself was extremely uncomfortable room needs to be painted and cleaned smelt like an ex smoking room horrible smell to walk into too few staff for number of guests in hotel long waiting time to be attended to phone call from room left unanswered indefinitely ,0
 perfect location for visiting the o2 great views comfortable and quiet rooms staff friendly and very helpful ,1
 tiny room very dark and dirty soap dish limited space to get out of bed ,0
 the room we were initially allocated did not match the room purchased however we were subsequently upgraded to a junior suite by a very helpful customers service manager laurine a late check out and a complimentary bottle of champagne were arranged to mark a significant wedding anniversary the room was very comfortable the staff very pleasant and the location excellent will definitely return ,1
 everything,1
 very friendly helpful staff interesting atmospheric interior room bathroom small but clean ,1
 excellent customer service a 5 hotel with a relaxed atmosphere which is not at all pretentious as some 5 hotels can be friendly helpful efficient staff made our stay memorable ,1
 comfortable and roomy ,1
 the room was well laid out and the bed and bed linen top notch slept so well i felt comfortable in every part of the hotel well done intercontinental o2 ,1
 we checked in two nights 1 on the first night there was machinery sounds next door so i complained to front desk which it stopped then i woke up 3 4am due to the sound again which i walked down to front desk to ask about this sound the staff said it was water pipe sounds due to heavy usage in the morning and couldn t be turned off as my daughter was sleeping in the room i requested to change room in the morning without interrupting my schedule of that day the staff promised they would move our bags to another room while we just need to leave the room key at front desk and go out for our planned activity the hotel should do the move by 12pm however we came back in the afternoon around 3pm there was nothing being done our packed bags were in the same room we reported and waited more than half an hour to switch to another room there were no body responsible and follow through my case which really upset me 2 there was fire alarm rang out loud on 6 1 around11am no explanation given if this was a testing the hotel should put up notice to inform guests if this was due to other problem the hotel should follow up with announcement to clarify the situation ,0
 poor facilities and room breakfast was pretty bad,0
 rooms very small if one body have a seat another one have to be stand or seat on the bed air conditioner does not work the room is like a oven lift does not work guest have to use fire stairs ,0
 the check in was smooth and the staff were very courteous esp ms serena we were given a room upgrade and complimentary breakfast too breakfast was excellent overall a very satisfying experience ,1
 rude staff and poor room presentation,0
 i was unwell whilst staying here and the staff were most unhelpful there was constant vacuuming going on outside my room there were no do not disturb tags so i called reception asking not to be disturbed but despite this housekeeping knocked on my door when i was trying to rest the restaurant only serves cold food one particular member of staff at reception was very unhelpful i got more assistance getting medical attention i needed from staff in a local restaurant than i did at the hotel ,0
 the bedrooms where of a very good standard of both d cor and comfort ,1
 check in did not work properly no contact person at the property did not get an invoice yet even though i contacted the property multiple times and asked about it,0
 very clean room,1
 the nibbles in the room if one was hungry as breakfast isn t offered ,0
 relaxing elegant bar lounge areas great location great choice at breakfast,1
 almost everything,0
 didn t eat in the hotel just there for sleeping,1
 rooms very small photos don t tell the truth can t even walk around the bed rooms to hot air condition limited range,0
 refurbished bedrooms are spacey and stylish the bed was very comfortable would have happily stayed a week ,1
 the nice rooms tv fast wireless the great bathroom,1
 fantastic location comfortable and good size room quiet despite being in the centre of london,1
 1 the room was very dirty because many drust in the room not clean or change the sheet bed 2 the carpet was not clean water leak on the floor and carpet 3 the room was very dusty i ran my finger across the base of the lamp by the bed just to check since everything seemed so dirty and sure enough the lamp had a layer of dust on it 4 someone try to open my luggage in my room i think they try to open it and try to change the number but something was wrong so they can t open it but i think very bad and so scare when you know that someone try to open your luggage poor experience of this hotel ,0
 we absolutely loved it it is the best holiday we have stayed in in the uk it was great in terms of the pleasantness of the staff the staff bent over to accommodate all of our needs they were polite and friendly ,1
 warm welcome as soon as you enter staff are friendly and helpful was offered an upgrade before we traveled via email but was ok with what we had chosen the room had a view of the shard and the view was beautiful at night time we didn t have breakfast at the hotel we took breakfast with us there is a microwave and a fridge brilliant location for big ben and the london eye and is a five minute walk from waterloo train station cant wait to return ,1
 lovely new refurbished rooms very clean and warm and quiet very friendly staff good location ,1
 on arrival the hotel looked fantastic better than i expected but that s where it ended we arrived just after 2pm and we re told our room was not ready and to come back in an hour at around 3 15 we returned and the room was ready we finally found our room which had a tiny number as the light up number outside our room was not connected wires on show the bed had two lovely towel swans on but was made a total mess with only one pillow each all the surfaces has cup rings and smears from previous guests the carpet was wet in various places where i m guessing the cleaner has stood a bucket the bathroom was filthy a dirty cloth used to clean the toilet the shower had mould along the edges it had clearly been repainted recently and there was paint all over the shower head the toiletries next to the sink had clearly been used and there was toothpaste from a previous guest down the frosted glass doors the sofa in the room which was originally yellow now with disgusting brown stains had some red cushions on with what looked like mud on the view was directly into flats next to the hotel even though our room was not cheap as it was new year s eve i knew the hotel was fully booked and we wouldn t be moved the following day we went shopping and returned to the room which had been cleaned a dirty cloth had been used to wipe the tv which now was smeared and stank the bed had been remade in a fashion pillows just thrown on also the cups spoons for tea making we re both dirty for a second time and we also noticed there was an issue with the plug socket next to the bed which worked when it fancied on the morning of our check out we were woken by workmen drilling outside the door hovering up dust disappointed is an understatement,0
 having to pay 10 parking 25 on event days i would expect actual parking spaces not try squeeze your car into a tight gap next to a wall or another car i had asked for a bath as i have really bad sciatica and wanted to be able to relax also had asked for a balcony as the room i was given didn t even have a window i could open the light on the wall was broken dirty mirrors the bed wasn t clean the bathroom wasn t clean i ve stayed here previously before booked 20mins after 10pm before i arrived had asked for a bath balcony which i was given was disappointed was planning to come back not sure i will again ,0
 location was great and the building had alot of charm,1
 noise bad attitude of staff non welcoming no smiling talking badly about arabs and they dont have the right since not all arabs same ,0
 the given room was more like a renovated storage room it was a corner room with a weird layout and we needed to walk two steps up from the corridor room bed two beds are placed one feet apart from each other with one bed located just a feet away from the window because of the jogged wall at the end of the bed that one feet from the window is blocked by the bed with that few steps up going to the room and the duct for air conditioning the ceiling is very low we do not feel comfortable a sofa bed is placed three feet in front of the closet we do not understand the purpose of it we did not request for a sofa bed given that the room is already very cozy that is why we felt like it is a storage room more than anything area safety a random fake tourist asked for direction and two fake policemen came to ask for our passport just a block away from the hotel we said no and walked away we have heard this kind of scam for tourists at other countries before we also heard frequent police sirens around the area after eight we just feel unsafe we thought that we were in some bad areas in nyc or chicago breakfast the waitress did not replace the tea cup plate and spoon after use and she wiped them with the cloth which was just used to clean the table we were eye rolling ,0
 extremely badly maintained waited 14mn in the morning to get an elevator on the 11th floor never came i finally broke through the service area to get a service elevator in the middle of the maids ,0
 room very dated blind broken small room,0
 still waiting for the refund of my deposit which wasn t included on the email confirmation door man had an attitude when opening the door reception staff were not friendly facilities were average overpriced and not worth the money ,0
 clean if small room very helpful front of house staff convenient location and nice feel to the main entrance lounge areas comfortable bed ,1
 breakfast and room ,1
 i didn t like the unfriendly staff that do not offer help to any of obstacles you face during your stay i couldn t even get room service to mix banana and milk for my baby i m hugely disappointed,0
 the beds were extra comfy staff was very helpful,1
 no temperature control in the room vermin running around the bar area vermin running around the restaurant being charged to park your car breakfast,0
 had to wait 30 min for breakfast which was fifty quid,0
 the hotel was a 5 minute walk from blackfriars station beautiful hotel with an impressive entrance on arrival the staff were pleasant and friendly and we got a complimentary room upgrade rooms were fantastic with everything you need ideal for our romantic weekend away bar staff were excellent and very accomodating to our needs they had a facility to leave our case so we could enjoy our day in london without our case having to come with us also a 10 minute walk from covent garden which was ideal if you don t like the tube like my boyfriend doesn t ,1
 location room was lovely and staff were very nice hotel was clean and restaurant had reasonably priced menu security was good too as they asked for room card at night overall it is s lovely hotel and would recommend to friends and family visiting london ,1
 good location to explore the city and st germain we were only in paris for one night but would have been comfortable to stay here for more ,1
 good breakfast and friendly staff and very welcoming,1
 tiny little rooms and more important incredible poor customer service they do not respect privacy and move your things from one room to another without even asking ,0
 found the following issues with a compact double room bathroom was shared it was not mentioned in the room title as most other hotels do much clearer but only with a short sentence in the room description easy to overlook also because two photos on the four available in the room description were related to a bathroom although then the room contains none the staff was clearly aware of the possible issue as this is the first thing they reminded me immediately after having charged me with the price of our stay proposing also an expensive upgrade to a room without shared bathroom bad smell in the room room with a window on a trafficked road one must choose between fresh air or silence to sleep no kitchnette and no microwave but such facilities now seem to have been removed from the description of that room no refrigerator tea coffee making facilities the kettle had a so short electric cable that it could not lay on the table or on the floor ridiculous but it was even not working hopefully it was changed with a brand new one but only after having requested it cutlery and crockery were not present at first we received them only on the third day on four for our whole stay still after having requested them but it was then removed and didn t reappear on the fourth day on the hotel website a toaster ironing facilities and a hair dryer are also supposed to be present in such rooms not present either a complimentary water bottle on arrival was supposed to be provided we ve never heard of it free wifi it was so weak and instable in that room that navigating web pages was really frustrating waiting time and streaming anything audio or video nearly impossible flat screen tv oriented toward the ceiling which is not exactly the best for a good vision i don t understand how this hotel can be part of the booking com s preferred property programme ,0
 room service is not acceptable as a 4 star hotel soup is a disaster if can not do it as standard why still have it very disappointed all the staff seems very insufficently trained ,0
 booking com told me this hotel has car parking it has 22 spaces for a hotel of this size you have to be early very early to get a space i would never have paid a premium event day price for this hotel had i known booking com should be ashamed of themselves i do not trust booking com after this after my final trip this month i will no longer do business with booking com after event bar service in hotel aaawas terrible gave up after 20 minutes waiting ordered room service and received mediocre food still waited for drinks as room service forgot them ,0
 i went there with my wife and reached by 9 o clock in the morning i requested for early check in which was denied by the hotel staff very rudely the girls standing on the reception were very rude and smile was badly missing on there face i was promised for tea maker while booking on booking com but when i demanded for tea maker it was denied i paid for big room but room given was very small and was without view which was very distrubing and they did nt change it location is really good just in front of main staion internet speed was very fast with good wifi connectivity breakfast was also good we paid 15 dollar each for breakfast ,0
 guest svc manager francesco was very helpful with our questions on places to go and ways to get there room bed was extremely comfortable and good sized bathroom was also a good sized bathroom with a long bath and a cute apex duck a very cute and novel idea ,1
 old carpets old furniture old bathrooms staff not very friendly and welcoming very expensive for what you get ,0
 comfy bed,1
 the building facade gave a complete misrepresentation of the property inside three floors with narrow staircase and no lift what staff there were not overly helpful and showed little enthusiasm the breakfast room was minute and basically in the cellar with poor ventilation the kitchen was a small room in the cellar and the smell of the cooking was transposed throughout the building the juice fruit and milk containers we re placed tightly together on top of a cupboard along with coffee warming machine the breakfast was not attractive and everything was swimming in grease the bedroom on the third floor was in need of a good spring clean the nets were filthy the floor sloped from one corner to the opposite wall overall not worthy of 2 stars at the most definitely not 4 star as advertised,0
 the hotel is lovely as well are the staff nothing was to much trouble and we were even upgraded to a studio which was great surprise can t wait to stay again when we re next in london,1
 the staff were very helpful and polite,1
"budget hotel, a few minutes walk from zaandam station. it occupies floors 9-11 of a tower block building. several lifts to floors.  quite small room with no opening windows. good quality comfortable beds & quilts. bathroom compact but good shower & free shower gel/shampoo. only 2 bath towels & no daily cleaning service.  2 women on reception could have been more helpful. arrived very early so put luggage in payable lockers. told to come back around 2:30pm. we returned at 2:10pm to be told check in is 3:30pm which we protested against. then told if you pay an early fee of €7.50 you can get into your room now!  mean & petty. we waited until 2:30pm i would advise staying here not in amsterdam, as it was so quiet at night & we had great sleep. zaandam is modern & has everything…",1
 location excellent staff very helpful ,1
 get access to swimming pool through restaurant or through street,0
 everything staff are extremely rude especially front desk never seen something like that before ever check in process is messy and not organized at all rooms are extremely small i mean small to the point we struggled with our baby cot and 2 pieces of luggage you can t imagine how miserable our stay was an finally the famous elevator with the lowest iq on earth and slower than a turtle and smaller than match box stay away from this hotel if you want to enjoy paris ,0
 staff are very rude and slow customer service is inexistent waiting time at check in was 1 hour waiting time for fixing the safe cash box was 45 minutes while the guests came to pick us up and waited in front of hotel in a car got locket out of the room twice because they annulled our room cards because we didn t pay for one bottle of water at the bar we told them to put the water in the room charge etc etc bad experiences never finished and every day was a challenge in dealing with the staff and management of this hotel who have zero clue about customer service location is also a disaster avoid this hotel if you can because there are plenty of other better hotels in london for sure at affordable prices ,0
 we travelled from australia and spent a total of 13 days at this hotel 6 in the beginning and seven at the end of the holiday we had trouble with house keeping in the first six days room not attended too after being out all day and so no tea to make a cuppa before bed when we went to book out after the first six days i asked the member of staff we dealt with would it be possible to have a river view for the seven days on our return but she curtly replied not on your deal the last seven days three of which had no house keeping at all until my husband spoke to a very nice gentleman on the desk would we stay here again no would we recommend this hotel no when along way from home one needs to be a guest in a hotel that appreciates their patrons ,0
 the staff were exceptionally attentive and genuinly friendly looking after us in a fantastic way the hotel is very centrally locatef to all the main attractions having 2 tube stations witjin 4 min walking distance there are plenty of shops and tasty restaurants all around the hotel ,1
 very tired hotel tatty furniture bath chipped noisy air con constant noise of over ground trains squeal constant noise from aircraft taking off from city airport extra charges for swimming pool and gym even the lifts were noisy and damaged this hotel requires a full refurbishment and consequently is no way a 4 star hotel ,0
 excellent facilities and good staff,1
 not convinced that teaspoons were replaced each day as they had a feint residual smell no double glazing so room a bit cold and moisture inside window overnight ridiculous price for breakfast originally 19 which i declined ,0
 excellent location good facilities ,1
 upon booking i let the receptionist know what i was booking the room for my 1 year anniversary with my partner when we arrived the room was decorated fit for a king and queen with towel swans petals and a very sweet personal card signed by the staff who set up the room of which i have kept and resides in my bedroom extremely touched and happy with my second visit to the plaza even happier than my first visit as a celebration for my 21st birthday ,1
 the design is really fun and fresh the beds were very comfortable most of the staff were lovely bathroom was big with a huge tub ,1
 rooms are very small and extremely dirty i felt very uncomfortable using the shower i ll never book here again ,0
 i booked a good room but when i arrive i was given the worst room in the hotel,0
 the room was in unfit state to rent ac not working tolet seat was insecure no contact number card to call reception wi fi did not work until staff re set system no price for mini bar no complimentary water winter wooly blanket on bed instead of duvet poor value for money decoration state below other hotels i forgot my family calendar and will see if hotel hold it for me ,0
 bed very compfy staff all smiling and welcoming,1
 quiet location nice staff especially jose and svietlana good breakfast what more a little bit small bathroom not a big problem for me,1
 the pool family room breakfast staff,1
 the location is fantastic right next to the park and very close to 2 tube stations staff were very friendly and helpful hotel was very historic grand and beautiful ,1
 beautiful building and room was an adequate size ,1
 excellent location beautiful hotel great breakfast ,1
 great location clean rooms and helpful staffs but tiny rooms like all hotels in london ,1
 the site states parking but when we got there there wasn t any the poor staff say it happens all the time and they have reported it but nothing gets changed we were very disappointed because i would of gone elsewhere i booked it because it said parking we had to park in another hotel and pay 20 not happy at all to mess around,0
 lovely food cocktails available in the bloom bar and restaurant,1
 location was excellent for london sights and theatre land rooms were well kitted out and bed was big and comfortable ,1
 low quality furnishings bedding poorly laid out bathroom tired d cor 3 star guest house experience not 4 star hotel,0
 parking charges we had two rooms and when we checked in we set off to our rooms to find one occupied and one unmade after return to reception and room swap we had an uncomfortable night down to poor aircon a complimentary breakfast was provided with an apology but this doesn t make up for our experience the hotel above l1 needs a good refurb in my opinion ,0
 better directions how to get to spa,0
 the rooms are very old and tired we paid for an upgrade and still had curtains filled with cigarette burns and furniture that was falling apart no hairdryer front desk said the last guestbprobably took it the corridors has bags of rubbish left in them ,0
 bad smell and even no water not only complementary but also in mini bar ,0
 the ambience of the hotel staff very helpful and polite breakfast was delicious a good choice of menu service excellent ,1
 friendly staff beautiful views tolietries good bartender great spa staff ,1
 found hair in my bath that was quite clearly not mine bath should have been cleaned properly wardrobe doors were precarious to say the least so i did not use it for fear of them falling out of the frame d cor was out dated and tied lots of road noise from the street below and i was on the 10th floor ,0
 elevator broke down for four days and the only way to go to my room in the fifth floor was by using the stairs ,0
 the bathroom was very nice the room well appointed ,1
 we stayed at the intercontinental for just the one night as we went to watch elo at the 02 we did not experience any difficulties on check in and our room was ready for the 3pm check in time the staff at the hotel were impeccable throughout and could not have done anymore to make our stay more enjoyable our room was spacious and immaculately clean with great views over the river thames coffee making facilities were first class the shower had the biggest shower head i have ever seen and we both enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep we ate in the hotel bar before the concert and can recommend the fish and chips again the bar staff were attentive and catered for all of our needs following the concert we visited the amazing bar on the 18th floor a beautiful place to relax and again floor to ceiling views overlooking the thames they even have an outside smoking area for smokers so it saves going downstairs 18 floors to have one my only slight complaint would be that there were insufficient bar staff on duty to cater for the numbers returning to the hotel after the concert and we had to wait about 20 minutes to get served a few extra bar staff would solve this especially when there is a popular event on at the 02 the drinks are pricey so if you are looking to pinch a penny to save a pound then this hotel is not for you personally i would rather pay a little bit extra as for me the experience outweighed the cost considerably the next morning we went for breakfast about 8 30am and did not experience any of the queues that some previous reviewers have mentioned a wonderful selection of pastries and everything you could wish for from an english breakfast before checking out we ventured for a swim in the indoor swimming pool you really must check this out during your stay as again it was a wonderful experience and the staff were a credit to the hotel ,1
 far to expensive for the room i was given,0
 the room size is around 4 sq metres the size of my bathroom a very uncomfortable bed impossible to open properly the cabinet as the room just doesn t fit any furniture if you open the door to the bathroom it feels like a prison cell the clean lady didn t bother to fill the empty bottles of shower gels and shampoo there is no temperature control in the room only the central heating which was acting up all the time or it impossible hot so i had to open the windows or it freezing the reception was useless it couldn t be a 4 star hotel ,0
 we loved the charlie and the chocolate factory tea it was the perfect girl s afternoon out during a celebratory weekend the staff was incredibly helpful and made us feel very welcome the concierge arranged for two fun tours that we thoroughly enjoyed the lobby bar was delightful our room was quiet and very comfortable the location couldn t be beat with a short walk to covent garden the theatres the thames and many restaurants we will definitely be back ,1
 construction going on all around the hotel so many paths closed had to pay extra to use hotel pool and spa which was a health hazard in itself stairs leading to changing rooms and pool were filthy pool tiles didn t look like they had ever been cleaned wood was rotted in the sauna floor had food and hair on it outside the shower outside sauna had a hot and a cold button had to press both at same time in order not to scald or freeze yourself pasta in pizzaria was microwaved staff were incredibly rude in all areas of the hotel at one point my aunt was asked to repeat if you understand now the wifi was incredibly slow and power points or lack there of were very dated like the decor in whole hotel the only part of this review i gave more than a sad face was the location i wouldn t even give the hotel a 2 ,0
 the rooms are of a very poor standard as a regular traveller for business this would be one of the worst rooms i have ever stayed in this was listed as a 4 star hotel and in my opinion it is no where close to this rating they have tried to redo the main bedroom to modernise them however this has obviously been done very cheaply and it shows the bathrooms however have not been touched and the taps were caroded and had green build up on them when you don t want to leave your toothbrush in the bathroom that says a lot about the quality and cleanliness very poor value for money ,0
 the room was small no where to put things bed was not comfortable room not clean dusty way over priced evening meal rip off and steak was poor confusion about the rate as it didn t include breakfast have stayed in far better for less in london,0
 firstly the walk from the tube station to the hotel is not described correctly as it is probably a 20min walk wheni got to the hotel i was informed that the hotel had a system error and that they did not receive my booking and subsequently cancelled my booking apparently they tried calling me 7 times that morning but could not get a hold of me as my cell number number was incorrect however they failed to use the south african dialed code staff and manager in particluar were rude and unhelpful had to sit in the hotel lobby for 3 hours trying to find alternate accomodation what was strange is that this occurred to other guests as well who used a booking agent to make their booking so was this just a way of the hotel trying not to pay commission to these agents by taking only direct booking ,0
 lovely building nice little extra touches flowers fruit wine chocolates etc ,1
 food friendly team a great bed you fueled 100 relaxed the other morning,1
 comfortable and nice staff,1
 i was charged extra for a breakfast that was already prepaid i was then told that this is done to everyone and then put back on to the card this is unprofessional and not needed when payment has already been made ,0
 we had a superior room everything we needed for our stay was available room was kept perfectly clean each day you can get a good quality quick buffet evening meal hotel well placed for the tube bus station and the eventim apollo where we were seeing a concert ,1
 we went for a concert at the apollo so the location was perfect ,1
 great facilities,1
 it s easy to get to from the train just a few minutes walk it is going though an upgrade at moment so not everything is assable,1
 i stay here whenever possible location by luxemborg gardens is awesome,1
 newly refurbished room,1
 dirty old fashioned tired and dated shower did not work and leaked over the floor no ventilation and uncontrollable central heating bed was dirty and too small i m 6ft and my feet were hanging over the end of the bed overall service poor a disgrace to be called a hilton as clearly does not meet the standards ,0
 the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in staff were so friendly and helpful enjoyed my stay thoroughly,1
 the rooms were beautiful the staff was top notch and the location was across from kensington park perfect for walking ,1
 easy access to the west end on foot friendly professional staff the building is beautiful with art deco features rooms of a good size ,1
 the hotel was lovely and staff really helpful,1
 amazing brand new junior suite perfect for our minimoon ,1
 air conditioning in the room was fantastic comfy bed and good pillows breakfast was splendid ,1
 concierges were excellent,1
 comfortable clean and quiet,1
 i was put in a nasty underground dungeon posing as a room with no ventilation and i was utterly claustrophobic it was like something out of a horror movie ,0
 room was too small i couldn t move in it ,0
 felt safe and at ease with the hotel,1
 worst experience i ve had ever while traveling could nt sleep due to the fact the i couldn t stretch my legs because the bed was small and between two walls do not book here ,0
 stains on table and floor long hair in bed not mine a bit run down ,0
 we lost a jacket in the room and despite numerous emails we recieved no response from staff ,0
 the hotel was beautiful it was very clean it was ideal in location the staff very friendly very helpful ,1
 kept getting woken up through out the night with noise could hear toilets being flushed through the day and night damaged time in the bathroom we made a complaint about the noise on the friday was told by a staff member that the manager would get back to us which never happened since we arrived home from our trip the staff have called us liars saying no complaints were made etc between the hotel and booking com our issues complaints are still not resolved if you are looking for a hassle free holiday i wouldn t recommend staying here ,0
 the hotel is quite convenient the room is clean location is ok and nothing to complain about ,1
 nice modern comfortable room lovely view heated towel racks were nice great location too ,1
 they need significantly more deposit if you pay in cash weird ,0
 room was very small view from window not pleasant shower cubical very small air conditioning too loud preventing a good nights sleep cost of room 219 00 was way too expensive ,0
 excellent location next to kensington gardens and a beautiful old building buffet breakfast was good and staff efficient when we had a problem with our room they upgraded us without our even having to ask the room and bathroom were very pleasant and all the staff were nice ,1
 there was no lunch or dinner,0
 the reception is very bad and dealing despicable liars,0
 location was great walking distance to lots of attractions hotel itself was immaculate comfy beds spotless bathroom with elemis toiletries couldn t fault anything ,1
 great location for o2 but also for the centre of london as the clipper river service stop is by the o2 a great way to get into the centre with views excellent service in the hotel from all staff we encountered very professional amazing breakfast ,1
 every thing else,0
 location excellent,1
 the staff at check in were terrible and messed up bookings we were asked which floor we wished to stay on and stated the top floor we entered the rooms and dropped our bags before heading out for the rest of the night unbeknown and not advised at check in the air conditioning was not working we returned to room temperatures of 27 5 deg when we complained in the morning we were flabbergasted to be told without apology that they new the air conditioning was not working such a shame as this spoilt the weekend,0
 the bathroom hadn t been cleaned properly the air con didn t work so room was hot the room and hotel looked tired the website advertised free wifi but we were told this would be 10 on arrival breakfast was cold service at breakfast was not very good with us having to ask for coffee and toast and not offered to us then they didn t know which table things were for not worth anywhere near the money we paid to stay ,0
 room very quiet considering it was adjacent to the railway and a busy road my room was very comfortable and well equipped and it s very handy having a gym on site very close to many london attractions and travel connections ,1
 hotel interior poor decor springs poking in your back from the materess smells of bleach bathroom old and chips everywhere needs modernization ,0
 pillows very comfortable tv easy to work view from room 1231 excellent very good breakfast nice to have own pot of tea and coffee great to have a bath supplied as well as shower ,1
 modern and fab cocktails ,1
 we were chosen as the guest of the day and so were given an executive suit for free the room was very spacious free fruits and wine were provided it was very clean two tv s coffee machine microwave fridge shower bath lovely view overlooking london overall lovely stay ,1
 everything,0
 the english breakfast is good and the junior suite is quite big and on the upper floor my parents and i had a really great time in london ,1
 room was very clean and the sofa bed made up on arrival very pleasant front of house staff allowed us to store our bags until we could check in as we were early requested extra duvet and pillows no problem liked the monopoly money the children could exchange for items nice touch ,1
 super noisy,0
 we were lucky enough to get a superb upgrade even without that we would have been impressed but that was a clincher what a view the photos say it all very convenient location definitely one of the best for access to central london ,1
 the hotel staff has made our anniversary celebration extra special big thank you ,1
 everything price no air con tired small outdated room staff rubbish stored outside our window,0
 the bad was awful a board screwed to the board is a joke at least in a premier inn you can have a decent nights sleep could not close the window as it was broke 13 quid for wifi is a rip off who charges for wifi nowadays anything to make a quick buck do not stay here it s very very average,0
 the hotel was covered with scaffold the air conditioning didn t work and it was impossible to open windows because of the work dust on the scaffold i refused to stay in the little first bedroom that they proposed me which was on the back side of the hotel it was all dark with black protective covers and no air con un trou rats they nicely proposed me an another room with more light on the street side but still far from confortable as it was mentioned on your booking site i would have like to be aware of the renovating work of the hotel so i would have not stay there as a french i believe it doesn t give a good image of french hotels for foreigners and i don t think it is what we need all at the moment i have been using booking hotel website for years but i don t know if i will use it in the future because booking agencies should be aware of everything about the hotels they sell ,0
 not value for money room cleaned far too late left us with no fresh things poor quality overall too expensive for what is was poor value,0
 the staff were extremely helpful particularly when sorting out problems ,1
 the staff were on hand 24 7 to help with travel directions using hotel facilities etc location is perfect 2 minute walk from subway and in a really nice area room was a little small but very clean,1
 the room was stunning did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door will definitely recommend ,1
 the bedroom was smelling of smoke ,0
 the bed is good comfort big size and sofa is good ,1
 it is 4 hotel but it is not look like even 2 staff which are cleaning rooms does not speak english i gave to laundry clothes they lost 2 items and insisted that they returned everything and argued with me that i miscalculated finally the laundry brought my missed items when i was catching a taxi and laundry costs unbelievable money if you are going to stay long time take by yourself to laundry coffee wasn t taste of coffee no variety of omelettes only two kind scrambled or boiled also hotel is under renovation and only one microscope lift is working only one person with one luggage may enter next visit definitely i will not choose that hotel what is this ,0
 loved the selection at breakfast,1
 liked the location and the style of hotel,1
 the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotless,1
 excellent service top location near tube and bus,1
 loved everything about the place ,1
 room too small overpriced it is a 2 star masquerading as 4 star breakfast fair tasteless coffee ,0
 the staff were not at all welcoming i would go so far as to say jaded if not unhappy at obe point seen arguing with a customer in front of customers the double bed i selected wasn t a double bed at all but two single beds zipped together and very poorly and uncomfortably at that so cheap such a bad sleep there were mice scurrying around all over the property in full view of customers from the main lobby to near the dining and bar areas to inside my room where i saw mice on two occasions during my stay the room itself had too much wear and tear with walls visibly stained marked and damaged and the toilets showing mould in the shower totally careless i asked for a non smoking room but the room i got reeked of smoke everywhere from the curtains to the toilet so bad i want a full refund ,0
 friendly staff nice rooms comfy bed though pillows aren t as comfy as they look there are two trams that leave from close to the hotel and one goes directly to central and both go to the main tourist hub oosterpark right on your door step,1
 overpriced no disabled room at hotel couldn t use the bathroom as bathroom was too narrow so couldn t wash shave etc had to use toilet close to reception not wheelchair friendly slow service in breakfast room ,0
 facilities,0
 i initially booked at earl s court and finally sent us to their paddington hotel because they have maintenance in some rooms no warning calls or email they pretend they could not reach me neither my colleague surprisingly they were nice enough to pay for the taxi to drive us to paddington but it seems to be usual practice to overbooke one hotel in order to fill in the other last but not least in paddington you have to cross the road to go to the breakfast room and it s noisy renovation works all night nearby ,0
 horrible design poor housekeeping just rubbish really,0
 excellent bedroom very large by london standards overlooking the courtyard pleasant staff good location for all the sights you can walk to st pauls and the thames quite easily nice area at night for atmospheric old style fleet street pubs ,1
 reception staff ,1
 the hotel is well situated to get around the city i travelled alone and had a single room which was just fine for me comfortable and clean a nice bar as well ,1
 i was put in a basement room with ghastly colours like a brothel and charged 35 for the stupidest breakfast there was a misunderstanding when the front desk said my booking didn t come with breakfast but she said go ahead and have it and i took it ahe meant on the house when i checked out they had charged me the sum i was so mad i told her and expected her to do something and she didn t even though she said she could see how it was misunderstood the place was dirty and old and it smelt of booze and old perfume i hated it ,0
 there was mould at the top of the shower cubicle and room was tatty,0
 not a 4star hotel inedible breakfast grumpy staff but could nt blame them really furniture windows carpets all falling apart location great for 02 but a lot of money to pay for this place ,0
 the room hotel is a no frills hotel very basic feels cramped dirty rooms need updating better for one person no room to open suitcases,0
 the customer service the over pricing and the attempt to charge unnecessary extras,0
 good clean comfortable hotel the staff are friendly and helpful they held onto our bags during our last day ,1
 low quality breakfast weak wifi signal very expensive,0
 heating not working only cold air coming out the vent absence of a proper customer support extreme staff turnover some tried to be friendly some extremely rude manager never reachable and not reliable only lots of lies and excuses had to change 3 rooms in 4 nights never a nice stay really a pity as if well kept the hotel would be ok and in a nice place change of manager might help,0
 location and staff,1
 customized attention very good beds,1
 the hotel was in a brilliant location the staff were very nice and welcoming and the rooms were quite comfortable and cosy would definitely recommend staying here when visiting paris ,1
 very noisy outside most of the night stains on chair in room poor waitress service at breakfast fruit bowl ran out hot food ran out at breakfast this made us late leaving and for return journey no one enquired if all was satisfactory very poor ,0
 everything gave us wrong bed over 3 times leaving us walking around the hotel with big luggages rude no service what so ever ,0
 loved everything about hotel facility s comfort views and staff but we weren t told about parking,1
 location was good and within easy walking distance of transport restaurant was ok and staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 all the staff were very helpful pleasant made our stay very memorable will definitely be going again soon good location excellent all the way round ,1
 amazing staff and impeccable structure not a single flaw special thanks to ben he could not have ben kinder and more attentive to our requests ,1
 standard rooms are very poor gaffer tape all over the ceiling broken toilet seat had to pay extra to upgrade room after complaining new room better but bed was very uncomfortable,0
 terrible parking they let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea i do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families ,0
 a very good excellent hotel expensive but well worth the experience,1
 check in was a painful experience after waiting 25 minutes we were given a room we went to the room and were met with somebody in our bed asleep we waited another 15 minutes and finally got a room with no air con on a hot evening staff member was incredible rude giving us the wrong room because i had a similar surname despite having one of the rarest surnames in the world ,0
 place for hotel not good the rooms not clean,0
 windows in room opened out to a brick wall the bed in the room was a pull down camp bed not comfortable hall ways in the building needed up dating carpets not clean water in the room had to be paid for this should be at least complimentary one a day ,0
 the staff were not friendly we were initially shown into a room for people with disabilities where the sink in the bathroom was blocked we did not request accessible room we asked to be moved the room we were then offered was on the third floor facing the train trucks so we could hear the trains passing every few minutes almost through the night we couldn t us the pool because children were only allowed from 11 30 am till 3 30 pm and we checked in at 5 pm and had to check out the next day at 11 am unfortunately the pool was a key reason for us to book the hotel in the first place overall i felt the hotel was a really bad value for money won t be going there again ,0
 my second night at hotel there was a crowded group of ppl partying making noise slamming doors i asked reception for help and they did not do their best to end this nonsense my room s heat was not working they did not take any action about my complaint the staff was careless i totally not recommend this hotel ,0
 ideal location for hammersmith apollo and tube stations clean room good bed and linen quick check in ,1
 fantastic staff beatriz was very professional fun and very efficient thanks,1
 the room was a perfect size and lovely layout and the breakfast was definatly worth paying extra for i actually forgot i was still in the country and thought i was at an all inclusive abroad with a very nice english breakfast and other things to go with it ,1
 lovely staff very helpful clean and functional ,1
 very comfy beds spacious room for 3 helpful staff ,1
 unfortunately this was not a good hotel experience and i can make the best out of pretty much any situation we arrived at 6pm to be told our room was not ready as they were still cleaning it having stayed at many many hotels all over the world i have never been told that i can t check in at 6pm the room was downstairs in a basement small pretty claustrophobic toilet seat hanging off and problems with plumbing so there was a loud noise every time the toilet sink or shower was used reception tried to charge us to leave our bags there whilst we went shopping the next day would have had a lot more to say if we had paid full price ,0
 overall good stay,1
 location was good ,1
 amazing staff very helpful great location the smartphone is very useful we loved the place and the staff for sure we will be coming again ,1
 room was like a shoebox not enough room to swing a cat,0

 clean comfortable room excellent bed and pillows excellent breakfast very quiet in a busy city ,1
 spa room and breakfast all first class,1
 the staff were very helpful and friendly the hotel is close to transport links local facilities and is within easy walking distance of much of paris we walked every day and discovered some beautiful areas not on the main tourist trails the paris of the parisians ,1
 very ruth and unreliable staff yana and her manager especially never settle to go to their basement rooms which they initially gave us with windows level overlooking to their indoor pool with no fresh air and constant noise loud music and screaming people until 2 00am from the bar every night of our stay 5nights when you have small child it was extremely difficult we were required to check in with receptionist every time when going back to our rooms if not our keys were not working location is in bad neighborhood too far from the city we had to walk over 15 min one way to get to the subway bus will take you forever we asked for hotel private taxi to go to silverstone grand prix he never returned to pick us up in the rain and after waiting for 2 hours we had to look for another way to come back to the hotel about 100 miles away and of course our keys didn t work at 1 00am so the hotel decides when you could enter your well paid rooms we ll never go back to this place again ,0
 the room was compact but bright and nicely decorated staff very friendly and helpful peaceful street but very close to earl s court tube would stay there again,1
 construction sound,0

 it was clean tidy and the staff were excellent ,1
 the staff were amazing ,1
 having spent 25 years staying in london hotels i have never had a mouse in my bedroom whilst eventually i got a new room the first offer was to put a towel at my door to stop them coming in the hotel admitted with works next door they had a mouse problem with the back rooms not what i expect from a hotel of this qulality,0
 the room was freezing because my heating was broken no one came up to fix it which was a huge shame and i ended up waking up with a bad cold and sore throat mini bar also wasn t stocked ,0

 unfriendly staff at the reception and the surrounding is bad ,0
 no bad experience but room was depressing very old wallpaper peeling off walls holes in table cover by side of bed lots of stairs to climb we were right at the top and no elevators bed was uncomfortable and room was cold staff bought up a heater said that heat would only come on when it was determined by a certain temperature outside and did not say what that was ,0
 poor service awful food tiny toom and very small bed ,0
 awesome hotel direct on my preferred list of london hotels to stay at ,1
 fire alarm went off at 6am and woke us up no toothbrush toothpaste in the bathroom ,0
 breakfast was average had to organise parking separately ,0
 we were put in a basement room with no windows it was probably one of the worst nights sleep i have ever had if you stay at this hotel do not get a basement room it is horrible ,0

 so lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying one person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands it came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately the hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room they also let us have a late check out for free of charge thats all of the compensation we had in my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think the managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it the hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too it anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms,0
 hotel clean and modern with a nice breakfast it is situated in a good place for transport into the city centre ,1
 cleanliness of rooms very poor staff and cleaners not speaking good english hotel is very tired and needs a refurb,0
 studio rooms provide excellent space to live in this hotel ,1
 lack of equipment in the room like a place to put the suitcase an armchair old furniture scratched with dusty moldings fridge not clean moldy and sticky glas door of the bathroom with finger marks paint no temperature regulation for the heating system small plastic shower tub with deficient shower head too expensive for that level of service ,0
 great location staff were very friendly and attentive ,1
 the customer relationship ,1
 after a long day shopping we decided to have a drink in the bar but not for long 2 mice running about ,0
 for emptying minibar i paied 9 euros extra charge,0

 this hotel was excellent clean and comfortable,1
 comfy bed very quiet floor to ceiling windows made a small room light outlook onto county hall roundabout strangely great housekeeping v prompt perfect for a short stay,1
 this hotel was terrible avoid them this was the only place we regret staying at out of all the places we stayed on our 2 week trip they were unpleasant and overcharged us despite assuring us that we would be charged the advertised rate for the night we stayed and assuring us that a pre confirmed adjustment to staying 1 night was fine the hotel is poor quality and they are dishonest and unpleasant avoid this hotel ,0
 staff very helpful breakfast hot and tasty room very clean ,1
 the carpet was filthy the beds were uncomfortable and i don t know whose hair the hair dryer would dry the staff did not know where a laundry was in the neighborhood there is no way this was a 4 star hotel ,0
 location wise very accessible to public transport near hyde park kensington park the staff were all accommodating the hotel itself tells a lot of history breakfast buffet is excellent ,1
 i have never stayed in a room so small not worth the money at all ,0
 everything,0
 comfy bed good breakfast and nice shower,1

 already complained to the hotel and booking com and have yet to receive our money back ,0
 rooms was dated not particularly clean and with a very noisy air conditioning unit in the room when opening the windows because we were near the restaurant we had more noise from those units poor considering this was a deluxe room needed a complete refurbishment,0
 the entire staff had excellent customer service skills and were always willing to help out,1
 we were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple the rooms were too compact wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles,0

 staff extremely friendly and helpful,1
 location close to hammersmith apollo the bar and food were very nice and served until late ,1
 no cold water in the shower ,0
 basement room next to the lien room strong chemical smell,0
 in the center of london ,1
 the room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious ,1
 free wifi is useless only way to get a faster connection is to pay a cynical and devious attempt to get more money out of people ,0
 photos on the website do not match with the reality completely you got charged for the hotel extras upfront and if yoy don t use them then you get refund but it s taking few business days already no mini bar the terrace is not there no matter what room have you booked you just get random one with a view to parking lot ,0
 called as error with preapproval not lifting staff have not responded as promised and a week later the preapproval is still on credit card people staying should get written confirmation that preapproval lifted when checking out ,0
 room wasn t that niceb,0
 everything,0
 the bar staff were very rude not helpful in the slightest the room service was appalling i asked for two different items on the 24 hour food menu which they didn t have very limited food menu all they had was sandwiches which come in a packet no plate provided over all wouldn t recommend staying here ,0
 bed comforts and room heaters try noisy,0
 the staff the accommodation we were given a complimentary upgrade as it was my husband s birthday wonderful ,1
 mini bad in the room bo working muldy walls in the shower arrogant attitude at the concierge ,0
 receptionists were really friendly and helpful nice room and clean,1
 also the room carpet was full of stain and it smell dust did not sleep well for the 3 days we were there waking up all wet all night no air conditioning there was homeless people at the door of the hotel we have been travelling in europe for a month worst hotel we got ,0
 location friendly staff clean room,1
 the restaurant was amazing ,1
 customer service is atrocious it seems that their motto has become the customer is never right i will never return to this hotel,0
 given upgrade to better and bigger room staff extremely helpful and friendly,1
 very nice hotel immaculate excellent location good size room would definitely stay again ,1
 the service was absolutely exceptional and they were so welcoming and constant attention to your every need was worth a return trip for sure exceptional staff and willing to go overboard to make sure you feel like it is your home away from home they were kind enough to store our luggage for a side trip outside of london that we took prepare flowers for an event we attended and clean an outfit that another restaurant spilled on the bar staff especially jacamo and angelo were not only a delight but truly made our stay with their personalities and care it was nice to return to them after a day of site seeing or event attending always upbeat staff the structure itself and decor was so well done and enjoyed the colors and style very much so english and beautiful nice detail touches the ribbons on the table in the dining room and all the flowers were so well done a romantic and picturesque hotel worth staying at air conditioner was great ,1
 everything was just perfect my doughter and i were seeing take that at the o2 so it made sense to use this accommodation as previously we stayed at accommodation a little further away definately stay here again just to add we even had a room upgrade with lovely views of the river ,1
 tiny room horrible reception cheap and nasty appearance grumpy staff hostel like atmosphere vastly overpriced ,0
 was late for 30mins for check out and charged me 25 pounds the room is extremely small and there was flies ,0
 view if the air conditioning unit in room 254 ,0
 no heeting in the rooms they ask extra payment for english breackfast wich is stupid because all the food is in the same place the hearing in the room was not working they dont mension that the main floor is under rapair ,0
 rooms are very small carpets are dirty no fridge in room power cut no intent,0
 moved to an overspill suites room which was old poorly refurbished and noisy made up for apologetic free wine and room service excellent staff,0
 pretty much everything except the room this hotel has almost no public areas that are not demised as bar or restaurant so as a guest it is more like an airbnb room than a four star hotel as previously noted the bar manager prides himself on getting the bar cleared early post 10pm to set up for breakfast and the non bar areas consisting of plastic covered chairs is more like an nhs waiting room than an hotel the manager reached out to us after my last review but we also saw some american clients informing him that they were canceling all their remaining nights so we are perhaps not alone in our frustration the hotel is next to a pretty public park yet late at night it is quite possible to walk into the hotel and to the rooms without any supervision or interest from the reception staff the lift is currently broken and the hotel s entrance is full of the required replacement machinery and vans in a taxi it is illegal to stop outside the hotel during the day the manager promised us he would turn things around though i am skeptical that this will be the case my advice avoid this place it s too far from any tube station and for this price there are much better hotel options in london ,0
 my notes i wrote down during our 1 week honeymoon stay internet unstable thin mattresses pillows hard as rocks metal ceiling fan spun unevenly felt like it would come off and decapitate someone no iron or ironing board in room despite being listed called and got reply we have in reception there isn t room service you have to come get it it was broken arguing staff indifferent rude staff no ventilation anywhere very small breakfast cramped breakfast room small room bad layout bad lighting placement of lights different lightbulbs everywhere had to open window for fresh air which meant having to listen to the trains train station random loud pump electric noise had to switch room because of it corridor maze to rooms doesn t have fresh air thin walls phone called 3 times 2 times 3 30 am once 7 am doors are very difficult to unlock and open fire alarm right over bed blinks really bright no toothpaste no fridge in deluxe double room 2 drinking glass 2 cups kettle no cutlery doors don t autolock bed was very squeaky slightest movement resulted in loud noise we payed for a deluxe double room at a 4 star hotel seriously ,0
 service rooms are run down our room basin was not draining was not fixed till next day breakfast was a very poor quality the servers were very rood i have lot to say but terrible experience that s all i want to say ,0
 booked the penthouse great views but room in the small side considering the price,1
 i like the laundry room and the free wifi and the location about 3 min walk from the london eye and 5 min walk through the bridge to thr big bin if u are group of 3 make sure you take room number end with 18 like 1118 or 1218 these the one i had alot of room,1
 there were layers of dust ,0
 the location was the only good thing ,0
 the staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them the room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great ,1
 rooms were pretty neat and well maintained supermarket just 2 mins walk nice cafes nearby just next to arc de triomphe,1
 no late check out not even 30 mins no free wifi no good room cleaning every day food at the room was so not tasty and no good support by reception lady,0
 great location,1
 nothing one of the receptionist she did a racist comment regarding my accent and my country the housekeeping didnt like was a disaster enter in the room without knock the door a tall girl ,0
 the staff were very nice,1
 this is our 10th stay at this hotel which should tell you how much we enjoy staying here the room we had had just been upgraded so was lovely and clean as always i know the carpark is 1 50 an hour but it is london are already planning our next trip to this hotel ,1
 stayed for 2 nights on 5 12 6 12 wasn t happy with the room because it s was so hot 28 degree so stuffy and can t breath and we both find it very hard to sleep both night we have lost a lots of sleep we have complained and they did change the room for us but we experienced same thing no internet in 4 stats hotel that s ridicalous the reception staff he was in his senior age but he was very rude and no politeness now i know why this hotel kept on having promotion because it s quiet not value of money wait till novota hotel finish building this hotel will be quiet as funeral ,0
 everything was perfect the rooms were great,1
 location was good and local to tourist attractions ,1
 it was so bad that i slept with the light on and didn t go back for the second night ,0
 room was tiny with double bed up against the wall one side nothing like shown on the website hardly room to sit on the loo with loo roll sticking in your side woken early 6 45am by cleaner hitting radiators and pipes outside the room for nearly an hour worst 4 hotel i have ever stayed in same applied to my colleague complained at reception didn t even get offered a discount ,0
 room service lost our order and any record of our room so we were left waiting for food then had to call up for them to explain a further hour before it arrived the robes and bedspread were frayed and tatty view of the gardens more like a path the external wall and a tree no gardens to be seen ,0
 location is the best being close to the paddington station makes everything a lot easier the room is perfectly clean staffs were friendly and helpful great breakfast ,1
 beautiful 5 star hotel great location for the o2 you don t even get wet rooms for roomy and extremely well equipped willl always stay there as it s only 10 mins to centre of london by tube,1
 best place to see the flypast of bastille day stunning hotel,1
 the hotel was very small and didn t have many facilities hotel room was smallest i have stayed in especially when the cost wasn t particularly cheap ,0
 bigger bed thermostatic bath shower controls ,0
 room stunk of cigarettes fridge was ripped out bathroom smelt of sewage no wardrobes drawers ,0
 the suit was ridiculously small no large mirror in the bathroom one mirror in the room to far away from the plug socket to allow you to see your self and blow dry your hair the tv was in totally the wrong possition it was to the side and not directly in good view for both people in the room in general the room was a bad design the bathroom in particular ,0
 the room is incredibly small the distance between the foot of the bed and the wall is approximately 12 inches and if you want to reach the window or use the telephone without scrambling over the bed you have to squeeze through this narrow passage i had only a holdall and was able to deposit this in the aforementioned narrow space this would not be possible with a large suitcase and i am at a loss as to where one could deposit a large suitcase let alone more than one large suiitcase except in front of the door which would make it very difficult to open the door from outside at 156 i consider that the room was extremely overpriced ,0
 nice welcome at reception treated like individuals rather than just another customer lovely clean and comfortable room that was not too small not cheap but would recommend ,1
 the hotel was very dilapidated the decour was early 1980s and in very poor condition with threadbear carpets torn faded and worn wallpaper and furnishings that were all very cheap dark brown and genrally damaged life expired this is possibly the worst hotel i have ever stayed at and had it not been for the fact that i had already paid and was staying only for one night i would have walked away from it a more depressing place it is hard to imagine staying at and it is not worth anyting like the rates they charge i paid 140 for one night in my opinion i have stayed at far better hotels charging 50 per night i will never go back to this hotel and would reccomend it only to people who want to pay a premium price to stay in a tatty run down depressing old fashioned and quite frankly dreadful hotel ,0
 i would have liked the 2 beds i paid for instead of the 1 i got i would have liked my teammate not to have to sleep on the floor when we were competing at the o2 arena the next day ,0
 very well looked after by all staff made to feel welcome and staff were attentive and gave as much time as we needed ,1
 nothing the hotel was too over priced for the small room you go 560 for two days ,0
 very helpful front desk staff ,1

 my room wasn t cleaned for two days despite information to the reception three times after the third time i went for dinner when coming back they had literally thrown some towels on my bed thats what they called cleaning see photo attached if you don t believe it i couldn t trust my eyes seeing this in a four star hotel that is i then insisted on receiving another clean room in booth rooms the aircon was not working it was boiling hot water pressure was so low that water only comes out dribbling when i tried to order dinner to the room i was told i will receive a call back which i never did as it was already midnight when i returned from work i then went to bed hungry reception desk staff doesn t know the area i was sent in the wrong direction twice when asking for the way to the themse ,0

 the hotel is full of elegant character in the public areas and the bedrooms are clean sharp and modern a lovely unique hotel in a great location ,1
 nice staff and helpful,1
 the room was very small and due to the lay out bed up against window was quite claustrophobic as the person sleeping on the window side had to climb over the other to get out the carpet in the hall and room was visibly dirty the access to the room was terrible aside from getting the lift to the correct floor we had to walk along several hallways and open doors with suitcases this was very awkward the bathroom and location were good apart from this i would not stay there again for the price it was very disappointing ,0
 the staff are extremely rude shortly after i checked out of this hotel i received a phone call from reception accusing me of stealing there pillows the breakfast was very poor quality there was not a kettle provided in our room to make a cup of tea so upon asking reception to solve this issue they told us to use the hot water from the coffee machine we attempted this and was completely disgusted with the results it looked like the water was taken from the river nile ,0
 the room was dirty it definitely wasn t cleaned i asked for a double room i got a twin room instead the shower was broken the room was freezing even if we put the heating on boost there were stains all over the throws cushions the lampshade was falling apart there were blood stains on the sheets ,0

 all staff were friendly and helpful ,1
 condescending rude unfriendly unhelpful and unwelcoming staff they make you feel like they were doing you a favour they deliberately gave me their worst room and were unwilling to change it the first night they are happy to toss you around until you get frustrated and quit ,0
 very friendly staff at reception and the bar facilities were very good and the rooms were clean and well maintained there was a problem with the heating when we returned in the evening of our first night but i would add that we were allocated a new room very quickly and given a voucher each for a drink at the bar to apologize,1
 very poor matress i had a back pain and couldnt sleep whole night ,0
 the reception guy at afternoon shift keep calling me about my baby my baby was 15 months and surely she was crying ,0
 my room was in a damp smelling basement under the reception area and below busy noisy stairs windowless and cramped no sleep hardly 4 star accommodation ,0

 this hotel staff and management go out of their way to deal with all issues that are raised if expectations are not met ,1
 the staff checking us in was rude and very un polite the breakfast was cold and tasted disgusting ,0

 there was no fridge available in the room also there was no warning on the vending machine in the room stating that once you take a drink out to have a look at the label you can not put it back the wifi had to be re set often as it didn t work very well more when asked for the use of a microwave the staff in other hotels even offered a microwave in the kitchen but a staff at concord mont was not friendly also the powerpoint for electricity was not near the bed side table ,0
 bad service spa was not open for 3 of thr days we stayed there staff is not helpful with finding other spas regret staying there ,0
 great hotel in terms of staff food and ambience in the communal areas fantastically located a few minutes walk to two tube stations seconds from kensington gardens and only 10min walk or 3min tube ride to paddington and trains to heathrow the west country and south wales the grande royale is also reasonably priced and comfortable for the area ,1

 everything from the bed to the staff rude gujaratis and goans a place happy to leave and not return nothing more to say rude people,0
 the hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really i surprised from them they should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in uk we like uk thanks,0

 the hotel is being renovated large areas are closed off and there is the associated noise and dirt associated with construction work the pool fitness area is only available at an extra cost and was quite dirty with evidence of a large amount work still needed the lifts were hopeless we stayed on the top floor and only 2 of the 3 went to all floor which meant getting from the lobby to the room could take 10 minutes the fire alarm was broken and sounded a number of times in the night ruining any hope of a restless night ,0
 location and cleanliness,1

 the location bad area if you want to explore the city and it s not safe,0
 how would you feel if during the summer months in london and nowadays they can get hot you get into your room and the air conditioning doesn t work and it struggles to move the temperature from 26 5 to 26 3 in two hours and it gets all stuffy and the windows don t open and when you speak to the front office or housekeeping they say that yes that is a problem but we can t solve it and then they rub it in by asking if they could do anything else we stayed 4 nights from the 8th to the 12th of july at this hotel at the end of our long travels our nights inside the hotel room made us believe we ll end our holiday on a new low but then the london weather smiled on us and became cooler for the last couple of days oh and yes they did move us from one room to another equally stuffy but the temperature did go down to 26 1 they did try to make with free breakfast vouchers for a couple of days but for you enjoy your breakfast you need to have slept well ,0
 everything else completly ruined our whole christmas family trip,0
 room size and facilities were great,1
 i would never go backi have enjoyed better staff in 2 star hotels it is tired and needs quite a lot of money spent on it having said that the dining staff and food were very good,0
 best sleep in ages in a hotel the style of the hotel was very welcoming also the staff were very good indeed to the customers especially luanna ,1
 the rooms are so small that you bump with almost everything its hard with no space,0
 there was a fair happening in the park across from the hotel the rides obscured our view of the eiffel tower the room was small and in need of renovation the hotel bar was horrible like something out of an old western movie staff were rude and unhelpful not worth the price tag ,0
 booked a double room got 4 singles the carpet was up in places and shabby i e the reception the room the 5th floor corridor the room itself was too hot there was a fan and an air conditioner in the room neither worked the window door would not open to let some air in i was awake from 4am i went downstairs to get water and had to pay a fiver for a bottle of water 4 pound for the bottle but the night porter had no access to change i never got back to sleep please do not describe this hotel as 4 stars i was in room 507 with a locked access door to the room next to me which meant i heard their conversations and arguements till 1am i never visited the bar pool or had breakfast so i cannot comment on them,0
 great room big and modern,1
 very warm welcome nice location,1

 the room was freezing cold the central heating wasn t working and got a cold as result they ve sent a technician to fix it without success i ve paid a lot of money for my accomadation but my experience was appalling to put it mildly ,0
 did not have breakfast,1
 breakfast was good,1
 the stay had been going pretty well we decided to go to disneyland on one of the first days we got to paris on our last day in the hotel the cleaners took the presents souvenirs that we both from disneyland we advise the reception about this straight away and the said they would ask the cleaner about it the next day and send me an email as we were leaving a few hours later i waited 3 days to hear something back from the hotel and received nothing i then took it upon myself to email them and they replied saying there is nothing they can do and that i have no proof they took anything i did not find this an acceptable or professional response i replied to their email and have still yet to hear back from them two weeks later i would not recommend this hotel as i find it uncomfortable to think that someone was going through my things took something that wasn t there s and to be told i ve no proof will definitely not be going back ,0
 the space where small the lifts was not working no window in the room no cupbourd for 2 people to unpack if they stay a week no one to help carry your 30kg suitcases down stairs and for the same amount for accomodation you get better service breakfast included staff to help you spacious rooms and working lifts in the hilton across the street if you email them with the concerns you get no response ,0
 fitness,0
 night shift staff team delay cooperation unfriendly lack of service mind dirty toilet wash basin was blocked by housekeeping and we got very delay solution so much trouble to our rest time room wallpaper and furniture should be maintenanced,0
 we stayed 3 person in a room but they didn t prepare it for 3 person only 2 bath towel 2 sets of toiletries no slipper in the room also on saturday 4 5 hours the water has gone in the hotel it was unbelievable nobody can tell me it is a real hilton it should be a fake property the bed in the room was uncomfortable where their springs are moving and looks like it is a not a standard hilton bed quality ,0
 being refused a drink in the bar because iwe hadn t booked a table for a drink tv didn t work in our room when we complained about the above no discount or refund was offered,0
 the location so close to the centre but beautifully quiet the efficiency of the whole operation including breakfast which is often the weak link in hotels the stylish decor within an old style exterior ,1
 location staff quite room single room but enough large price,1
 the reservations team were very inflexible and displayed very little customer service really disappointing for hospitality,0
 loud staff they were moving furniture late in the evening i called reception and they said it would stop it was an hour after until it did so it was 11pm at night i wanted an early night and didn t expect to be kept awake ,0
 very old smelly place definitely not worth its price rooms are decorated with old used furniture 80 i stayed in many 3 places around the same destination and they were much better compare to bedford bedford do not have electronic key to the rooms this place was not touch by any refurbishment for ages highly not recommended in this condition ,0
 room arrangement friendliness and helpfulness of staff and the location location location ,1
 the ac heater was not working and the weather was almost zero in paris bad cleaning bad service,0
 very nice room and comfy bed,1
 timeless elegance to this lovely hotel the staff made you feel special and on hand to help this was a very special treat for us and it was the right choice of hotel ,1
 the whole place is run down we got a big room at 7 floor where neither trouser press tea cooker was working armchair was very worn and lockers was loose internet did work intermittently so we checked our mails on a restaurant in canary wharf breakfast was the most tasteless i have experienced for long time i sent a jacket for cleaning it come back just pressed not clean the staff seems to be helpless or just fed up with the management they only said i am sorrry never fixed any problem i could also see the building had structural defects might be better they tear the whole crap down and built something new with new management the whole atmosphere reminded me of intourist hotels in soviet union this hotel is a disgrace for london ,0
 size of room unkempt decor warn flooring in bedroom web description not matching reality,0
 client service of this hotel is very poor staff not friendly absolutely not client oriented bathtub in room had several damages due presumably to shower appliance strikes on it room was very small as it was for 3 it had a sofa bed we never asked for that so we had real small beds and little space for circulation there are no do not disturb tags available for guests elevators are really slow and quite a lot of waiting needed there is a sign at the elevators where the hotel suggests that you should make reservations directly with them in order to have a better price ,0
 me and my boyfriend got engaged at the hotel and the staff were absolutely fantastic ,1
 location clear rooms,1
 the room was very comfortable with a lovely view room was very clean and well equipped the hotel was so convenient for the 02,1

 the room was not clean the towels were tiny poor value for money the staff were not sympathetic and language was poor in communications,0
 the grill restaurant was really really good and the staff was super attentive and friendly the hotel is less than a block away from the tube station there s a starbucks less than a block away and a grocery store by the tube ,1

 clean comfortable and in a great location,1
 beautiful building rooms were lovely food was brilliant all round a great hotel,1
 rooms were a really nice size excellent location nicely decorated the hotel reception staff were so friendly and helpful really appreciated this as it was our first time in paris would definitely stay here again ,1
 breakfast is a joke you have to wait 10 to 30 mns lifts are in the mornings blocked for several minutes aswell my room had no window i know now how prison feels value for money is very bad 200 gbp per night taxis are more expensive if the concierge calls them he asks them for a commission 2 taxi driver told me this when i asked he adds minimum 5 gbp up to 20 gbp for airport transfer by the way my room had a terrible smell the reason could be that there is no window so no fresh air at all ,0
 friendly staff location and decent rooms,1
 i didn t like how after i prepay my room and call twice to confirm i get put in a different hotrl that s nowhere near what i wanted and still paid for the better hotel,0
 i have found a mouse in my room and all what i got from manager sorry we will get expert opinion about that,0
 loved everything would deffo stay again luxury room and hotel and perfect location ,1
 the rooms were comfortable and clean breakfast was very good,1
 staff excellent location really good,1
 the air condition was not working in all rooms and the building traps the heat such that it cools down only a few hours after midnight ,0
 grumpy staff rubbish hairdryer and air con didn t work ,0

 room was very small no shower curtain no cold water in shower,0
 every thing staff room noisy they dont care about clinet,0
 everything,1

 location is great for covent garden and central london very friendly and helpful staff room was extremely clean and comfortable for where it is its great value there was even a charger lead in the room for my fone ,1
 the staff treated us like old friends and were helpful without being overbearing i took my car which was parked overnight without any problems ,1
 room location cigarette burn on toilet seat stains on bedding put in separate building across the road to reception noisy and no lift room at top very small,0
 the room was tastefully furnished and very quiet i particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold christmas period the windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in england with kensington gardens literally 1 minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park ,1
"hotel was fine, fairly clean, easy walking distance to train station. good shower and plenty of hot water, shower gel supplied in a dispenser. towels supplied and changed on request, room is cleaned every 5 days unless you pay €15. there was some dust on the floor and some dirt under rim of toilet, and the pillows were so horrendously thin  (and only one per person) we made temporary pillows out of clean clothes and towels. this made the otherwise perfectly clean and comfortable bed difficult to sleep on. overall not at all bad for the price and conveniently located a ten min train ride from the central area, but still with plenty of local eateries and places to go. staff deserve a special mention for being super friendly and helpful. ",1
 cooked breakfast was excellent and very tasy good variety also from the continental choices,1
 the staff were extremely welcoming complimentary upgrade on the room was a lovely bonus the bed was extremely comfortable ,1
 food was discusting cold uncooked and overpriced staff were rude and abnoxious wouldn t give our car keys back and followed us around after taking 100 euro for parking ,0
 bed and linen very comfy and high quality all room facilities excellent staff willing and happy ,1
 the customer service attutude the beds comfort wise awful the cost upmarket premier inn overall appalling,0
 we booked a double room and got given 2 single beds pushed together view out of the window was peoples back gardens and most nights they were having parties and were loud so it was hard to sleep the room was tiny and looked nothing like it did on the internet no where near as modern we stayed for 5 days 4 nights and the whole time we never had hot water in the shower except for on the last day got told a lot of misleading information and it wasn t in a very nice area definitely not worth the money ,0
 it was a very pleasant stay here the room we got was very clean and modern we had a little balcony 5th floor which was very nice you can darken the room very well the bathroom was spacious very rare for paris the elevator though was very very small but i think this is rather a detail the staff was very helpfull and friendly you can leave your luggage in the hotel as you checkout and you still want to discover paris we didn t took the breakfast at the hotel the hotel is located in a very good neighbourhood of paris the distance to the nearest metrostation is not close but nor far either you have a little supermarket in the neighbourhood this hotel is recommended ,1
 horrid tiny room awful massage bed that makes more noise than anything hotel has spent a fortune on all all the latest gagets but lacks comfort space over priced with little in return charged you for dirty laundry bag was kept waiting at reception at check in got told complimentry bar only to be charged on debit card when left requested balcony at booking having spent over 280 a night without even breakfast through my experience of having stayed in top nationwide hotels worldwide this is one of the most worst dont bother to complain the management put themselves right first you as a customer second ,0
 the managers attitude towards helping us with our requests her name was maria and she was no help what so ever her attitude was disgusting and she just kept walking off halfway through us trying to talk to her ,0
 this hotel was super close to two main underground lines it was also close to bus stops also around the corner was a tesco express and other shops to pick up essentials all staff was very friendly and readily accessible for any needed assistance ,1
 i usually stay at the novotel blackfriars which shames this hotel rooms are dated and standards are more like an ibis than a novotel personally i ve stayed in better premier inns ,0
 comfortable clean and quiet staff were very friendly and helpful ,1
 loved everything all perfect clean comfortable great sized room had everything we needed,1
 very comfortable room and bed lovely staff best hotel breakfast i ve ever had ,1
 breakfast was wonderful can t beat the location ,1
 very accommodating friendly staff,1
 we received a free upgrade to a junior suite staff were very polite and extremely nice to us ,1
 facilities were new and clean ,1
 cost 20 pound per day for parking at nearest car park ,1
 the space of the studio was great and facilities perfect for a small family ,1
 the staff were absolutely awful especially the hotel manager at check out he took my money off my card in a secluded place without me being present or getting my authorisation and refused to give me a break down of what i m paying for he inflated the price because i left two days early so i ended up paying the same amount as if i had stayed the full time i booked all in all everyone was very dishonest and they all kept contradicting themselves ,0
 toilet was separated from rest of bathroom in the tighest smallest closet like room there was a strong smell of old urine in the toilet stall and it did not go away this hotel is only feet away from the eiffel tower but the stay is not worth it the staff was not friendly either and lacked interest in wanting to help us tourists with any information we asked the bed was hard as a rock too so be prepared for the aches and pains ,0
 very little sleep as noise in the room corridor in the early hours bathroom stank toilet seat broken when this was mentioned at check out she didn t even acknowledge that we had a disturbed nights sleep service in the breakfast room was terrible we had to ask for tea cofee no alternatives offered hadda ask for toast very little care taken overall and we had to do all the leg work to get the basic breakfast requirements,0
 hotel is under reconstruction now and it is not mentioned on booking com no lift available now no a c and windows are closed due to work on the facade outside the price i paid for one night was definitely excessive due to the current conditions ,0
 the building is gorgeous the staff are super helpful and it is excellent value for money especially in london it s around the same price as a generic chain hotel but so much nicer they even took our bags to the room for us the bathroom was so nice and clean and bright i was staying with my boyfriend and even though we re only 20 they treated us as well as anyone else which isn t the case at every place also breakfast was great everything you expect from a buffet ,1
 noisy hotel guests drunk running wild breakfast was a shambles you are not the priority,0
 no kettle in room no safe no fridge,0
 1 the key was broken had to ask stuff to open with special tools till they fix the key they told me the time to come and fix they never come they fixed when i out but that s kinda uncomfortable and unsafe for me 2 the bath booth are kinda skeleton even it has cloths to cover you can see the whole naked if you re staying by yourself should be fine but friend awkward ,0
 5 flights of stairs to get to room with cases to carry and no lift the staff did not tell us this or ask if we could manage i felt the premier inn i stayed in the previous night was better value for money at half the price with an exceptional choice for breakfast i would not stay at the park ave again ,0
 bathroom,0
 the worse customer service experience i ve had in a hotel the a c was faulty and the front desk didn t only act completely uninterested in helping but even bothered by us never fixed the problem and weren t even slightly appologetic by it ,0
 extra charge of 45 on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception,0
 we didn t get the room we paid for for the first night even when we got a better room for the second night we couldn t open the window due to noise from an air conditioner outside the window the first night room was clastrophobic with frosted window when we open the window we got piping and air conditioners in front of our window with constant noise the room had no bath as was promised on the room photos on the hotel website generally there was a shirking contrast between website photos and the room it was very disappointing especially taking into account that we booked the room 4 months in advance ,0
 great service and facility,1
 overall service at stay at a brand hotel is totally unsatisfying ,0
 the room on the first night was awful blocked shower old creaky bed a broken tv very disappointing for price,0
 the room size and the bathroom,1
 the location is horrible and it took me 2 hours driving round in circles to reach the hotel and the interior design was not nice at all my room was not ready for the kids the sofa bed the breakfast restaurant was very unclean,0
 horrible experience ,0
 the room was lovely facilities were good easy to the tube to travel around london the views were good and the staff were really helpful and nice ,1
 location,1
 our room was made to feel welcome in since we were newlyweds from the night before ,1
 the bathroom was light pleasant and very clean the wardrobe space was good and there were tea making facilities the bed was comfortable ,1
 pleasant staff unique building ,1
 the rooms were absolutely tiny nothing like the pictures on the website you couldn t close the bathroom door without maneuvering around the toilet first and once you d taken all the cushions off the bed there was no room to walk around it would have been better of staying in a budget hotel ,0
 outstanding and very courteous staff great breakfast,1
 staff welcoming and friendly,1
 the lamp in our room didnt work the satellite cable used to go off and the tv was displayed with no source after change of sheets on our second day we returned to tea coffee stained sheets staff make you wait a long time even if they don t have any customers to deal with especially the ones that help around the kitchen found a fried egg with a hair on it right infront of the chef and she failed to detect it completely put me off breakfast that day the underground car park seemed very risky as no sufficient lighting also had some young teens running in past midnight which concerned me and my wife for 660 3 night stay i d expect a lot more compared to 740 i paid for flights and accommodation to sofitel dubai last summer this was a 1 star experience the uk needs to renovate the shoddy buildings it s a class below the rest of the world wouldn t recommend this hotel at all pay a bit more for something in the city novotel etc location is not the best it s about 15min walk from nearest underground and 3 min ferry ride and 9min walk to canary wharf station the area itself feels unsafe the hotel doesn t even offer water me and my wife would take our own bottles at breakfast as the two bottles are finished by the time we get to breakfast around 9am we had a queen guest room which we upgraded to a better view for 20per night as the others were taken absolute extortion room was relatively small the bathroom was a joke the tub and tiles had limescale and the sink was very low and really small had to wash my hands at the side of the tap because i couldn t lather them directly under it if you try to wash your face water spills everywhere they have a bar across our side of the room apparently they had a prom night for students loud music went on past midnight which could be easily heard through the glass like i was sleeping outside very narrow lift and corridors ,0
 the bed was extremely comfy and the jacuzzi and sauna are outstanding facilities,1
 from jennifer s courteous and professional welcome at check in to tamara s warm and friendly service in the clipper bar what a view everything about my stay was perfect the beautifully appointed rooms were extremely comfortable and quiet ,1
 service breakfast room location,0
 helpful staff when we had issue with booking com reservations not on their system easy access to underground,1
 the room was spacious and very comfortable the choice for the breakfast was amazing ,1
 lovely hotel staff were fantastic very helpful food was wonderful too ,1
 no facilities at all for the money value we are paying breakfast very poor no water in the room no mini bar ,0
 highly recommended,1
 it is a beautiful old hotel a bit worn down but with distinct charm ,1
 the hotel was situated in a convenient place and was very nice ,1
 i loved how the rooms were designed i can say it was the most hotel room i ever liked i was amazed by the bathroom floor as it was heated so your feet won t feel cold they provide for each room a cell phone with free internet national calls and international calls for selected countries near by most attractions friendly staff ,1
 we were two friends sharing a superior twin but were upgraded to a penthouse lovely views and meant we could also have separate sleeping space using the bed settee we did have faulty air con light bulb and the bath was very slow to drain but reported and apart from the bulb was resolved housekeeping very efficient to make up sofa and arrange opening of patio doors ,1
 very small room ,0
 the room was absolutely airless to the point of stifling although i had an extre night booked i decided to leave one night early as i couldn t stand another night of roasting in hell i had a single room one night facing a wall so changed to a double not much bigger still facing a wall and like an oven also they were very unbending about changing one night s accommodation for me to another although in money terms it wouldn t have changed anything for them and the room was available it would have made another loyal customer for them it is not great to shoot themselves in the foot by some silly rules that can be adjusted in special circumstances every customer counts and word of mouth is still the best or worst advert the hotel is called grand but in fact it is a very tired hotel and needs an update badly i would be spending my money somewhere else in the future,0
 the hotel staff very rude to me except ali and evening manager on the night i checked in will not recommend this hotel to anyone waste of money very very disappointed,0
 modern hotel the room is big the bathroom is big and good,1
 room and standards were awful first room had people s things in it when we got into it total incompetence and no effort to offer any discount if we wasn t so tired we wouldn t have stayed ,0
 fabulous building with character ,1
 the hotel is quite dated and in need of refreshing use of swimming towel and towels is an additional cost along with the wifi staff on reception were rude and unhelpful a staff member happily handed me an email address to complain rather deal with my concerns at the time ,0
 staff ripped us off with prices,0
 cold room no extra blankets no bathrobes all a bit mean for 189,0
 the breakfast was great so much to choose from and plenty to have to fill you up the room was perfect size and very clean no noise disturbance from other guest or the outside world the location for the hammersmith apollo was excellent a 5 minute walk at most ,1
 dated poorly maintained bedrooms need complete re fresh re decorating v poor for a so called 4 wouldn t recommend this hotel is of a 2 standard it must of been awarded the rating based on facilities which are at additional cost if used,0
 small but comfortable room very friendly and helpful staff,1
 this hotel is a desaster i have never seen a room bathroom so dirty disgusting ,0
 i can t believe i was charged for cleaning on my card ,0
 staff rudeness building work without prior notice tv remote not working and selective tv channels not available ,0
 1 welcome service for honeymoon was so touched 2 luxurious atmosphere at reception area 3 close from the tube station ,1
 on this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny the d cor was ok perhaps functional is an apt description there was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to earls court station was ideal ,1
 beds were fantastic rooms spacious location set back from street,1
 beautiful classy hotel a great price,1
 the room is a shoebox the moment our luggage was inside we could hardly access the bed the shower is half open as it is so tiny guess to give the impression of space so the whole bathroom is wet,0
 on this occasion i had a decent sized quiet room on the top floor the public rooms are very atmospheric with dark panelling stained glass and comfortable chairs ,1
 same as above ,0
 really friendly staff very family friendly,1
 room very nice great location lovely hotel ,1
 very bad room service since the dont have one you need to grab your own stuff from reception if u request to get smthg reception staff are very rude specially night shift ones,0
 the room was excellent and very comfortable the staff were very attentive and pleasant there was ample parking on site we were there for a concert at the o2 so the 5 minute walk was brilliant ,1
 unclean spit on hallway carpet bad breakfast don t waste your time waiting for elevator if you leave room 8 00 9 30am take stairs gym cost 4 pounds and 1 extra if you dare ask for a towel and it s only open 7am 10pm apparently not even 10 min early wifi is a nightmare with bitbuzz who btw won t give you a refund if you device doesn t connect ,0
 very rude and in helpful staff all of which are foreign and pretend to not understand english when faced with a problem possibly the only hotel in the world that doesn t have a spare duvet or pillow anywhere very loud air conditioning which made a dripping noise all night all in all the hotel is let down by the immigrants that where on duty i would never stay there again ,0
 everybody was so friendly ,1
 just 2 min from undergroud station nice and clean hotel ,1
 location,1
 fantastic location and superb service,1
 everything,1
 everything,0
 location,1
 from the minute of standing in front of the reception you made to feel valued all staff were great room fabulous breakfast was so good words cannot tell the storey fab hotel will go back,1
 bathroom smelled like a sewer rooms were very small and cramped pull out couch in the suite was very uncomfortable breakfast buffet was chaotic and poor quality,0
 courtesy of employees,1
 staff cleaness noise of the rooms next door too small rooms value for money,0
 bed and pillows were terrible toilet didn t flush on the second day of our stay we have to go down to lobby for toilet use a staff came to our room and simply said you have to wait for technician to come at 8am no sorry at all for the inconvenience i can t believe this is a 5 hotel it definitely doesn t up to that standard,0
 nothing paid 200 stg and got crap bed was pathetic very very conjugated it seemed like i was crawling through tunnels to get to the room,0
 so noisy you feel your self in underground train,0
 dirty windows unhelpful staff ,0
 staff seemed hard pressed and overworked felt like we were stuck away and multiple attempts still kept us from getting enough room for three to comfortably share one room promoting the location as being close to attractions that are over a mile away doesn t seem right ,0
 the check in process was very slow and made us run late for a booking we had made after the rooms didn t have air conditioning and was very hot we had one fan for 3 of us which didn t do a lot ,0
 hotel bar is really good great for a drink and chilling location was great connection with 3 tube lines staff was friendly house keeping staff was great rooms are very clean matresses are very comfortable ,1
 old fashion and not well maintained rooms ,0
 very comfortable in general,1
 comfy bed close to hyde park ,1
 no jug in room when given one it didn t work got another one tv did not work kept going blank no english channel to watch olympics staff didn t care stained carpet soap dish broke off wall only had one screw ,0
 i think booking com should have a way to investigate the self claimed standard of this kind of hotels who are claiming to be 3 4 or 5 star hotels as this hotel is being advertised as 4 star facility but i could not find a single star compatibility rooms without wifi and telephone very uncooperative staff poor and dirty old furniture ruined my holidays ,0
 the hotel is perfect ejem you trav s with kids,1
 perfect location for where i needed to be very central drinks in the bar were lovely ,1
 everything else,0
 the staff so so friendly and accomodating they went above and beyond to find room in the freezer for medications and the concierge helped us on a daily basis ,1
 the rooms are lovely we were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful as our stay was for my husbands 40th birthday this made it extra special,1
 the room key didn t work so we had to be taken to the room the hotel is dated and communal areas are scruffy and dirty and for 200 felt like a total rip off the bed linen was clean but honestly not up to todays standads of even a premier inn ,0
 two fire alarms during our stay one at saturday in the morning around 8am no explanations were given service sucks moreover the lobby stinks of cheap perfume ,0
 friendly welcoming staff who even provided complimentary bubbly for my daughters 18th delicious breakfast comfy beds ,1
 comfortable small hotel with a lived in atmosphere staff very helpful and all facilities you need especially for a place of this size ideally located for southwold would stay again ,1
 the hotel offered guest a cell wifi mobile app with map and gps ,1
 room shower bed duvet too thin whole interior of hotel please avoid keep your money rude staff ,0
 it is more like collage accommodation than a hotel my room a courtyard view was 1 5m from the next window sleeping with an open window in a poorly ventilated space was like sharing a room with another person it is totally over priced for what you get and the service is reactive it was a really bad experience i will not recommend the place to anyone the rating is probably obtained from tourists that might think it is a historical site but it is definitely not comfortable business accommodation the way it is represented on booking com make it as if it is on a garden with a old style charm but this is nothing like the perception they create with the photos ,0
 we paid for an upgrade and had to change rooms due to cleanliness and very poor state of decor and repair new room slightly better but bed very uncomfortable mattress was very old and discoloured no offer to help move our luggage to new room no apology from anyone re our problems ,0
 reception staff were so helpful they were amazing trying to help my husband get an early check in as he had been travelling over 24 hours and was shattered brilliant all staff friendly and helpful ,1
 very small room and construction going and noisy during the stay i asked quite room and they put us next club and pop and all the night music were loud not able to sleep they commit to transfer to another and no response ,0
 finding no car park when i had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying there was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way the staff were a bit abrupt not really listening i asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening i called reception they said one coming very soon i had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told some time later i had said i wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten i took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before the answer was no but we could have a fan i said no because i did not want to risk waiting ,0
 we had 2 rooms as we were taking my mother in law to the o2 for her 84th birthday treat the staff were wonderful making a real fuss of her they brought her out a selection of free cakes after our lunch and because the connecting walkway to the arena was not ready yet and she has mobility issues they laid on a complimentary taxi to and from the show on our return to the room she wasn t able to climb onto the beautiful big bed so they brought up a smaller bed for her and made it up within 10 minutes priceless ,1
 the room was really old not matching at all with the common areas downstairs the bed was not comfortable at all not a normally hilton hotel value for sure ,0
 the location in a quiet park with a great terrace the space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste the gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable it s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in amsterdam staff was very friendly and accommodating the restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat,1
 while the young lady who tended the front when i arrived was perfectly lovely she was the sole bright spot during my stay she readily and happily allowed me to leave my bag until check in time since i arrived at 11 a m one would have thought the bag would have made its way to my room when the room was ready it did not further the surly sour puss who was at the front when i returned couldn t locate my bag gave me haphazard direction to my room which was in the wing and required going to the second floor following nonexistent signs going up a small set of steps for a 3rd story room the room needed maitenance a good cleaning and the lighting was horrible the view was over an ugly rooftop lastly you are warned that no outside food and drink are allowed presumably to hold you hostage to their own restaurant and bar ,0
 generally not clean very noisy not able to sleep sad faded hotel towels thin and old ,0
 very very untidy and very old and not maintained reception staff bad rooms are very bad even if you look at ceilings you see the plaster coming out bathroom taps comes out if you press them what a waste if money the hotel was ,0
 the staff were all exceptionally pleasant polite helpful and attentive the hotel was sparkling clean and stylishly decorated throughout the handy device is a great idea ,1
 room way too small not adequate for 2 people ,0
 friendly professional staff kind and helpful great facilities for a london hotel would not stay anywhere else when on business or shopping ,1
 staff were lovely hotel was beautiful upgraded to a better room free of charge superb location and views delicious cooked breakfast ,1
 new clean and reasonable location for restaurants in st michel not too close to avoid the noise ,1
 service,1
 management,0
 bathrooms were not clean bed uncomfortable musty smell pillows not comfy and had stale smell very run down window sills filthy ,0
 bad attitude will never book there again,0
 you cannot get a better location if you are visiting the 02 especially loved the private entrance straight into the arena only available for vhotel guests the hotel is simply beuatiful stunning my gosh it s extraordinarily expensive its more than some west end hotels with not the same attractions however we loved that kids ate free if you are staying in the hotel and their rooftop bar was breathtaking bedrooms were soo comfortable and with modern technology with their tvs and air conditioning it was a definately luxury if you want to treat yourself then stay here but value for money it is not it s for sure expensive but beauricular the staff could not be more welcoming and gave my son a little welcome gift as we arrived when i win lottery i will be back again ,1
 staff were rude rooms are tiny dated and unclean 5 prices but not 5 service rooftop bar is certainly not 24hour soft drinks on the roof were served out of 2l bottles flat and warm as not refrigerated and 5 each no management on site to hear our complaints ,0
 the room was not very clean with stains on the carpet and down the fridge door the tv did not work as a result of which we shared out first evening with a technician in the room for over one hour attempting repairs one of the drawers in the room would only close if manipulated probably the main issue was that the room we were in had a connecting door to the room next to it and as a result we could hear the conversations of the people next door and their television which they left on one night until 3 00 am the next morning one of the reasons for selecting this hotel was that we had stayed their the previous year and found it very good this time we considered it to have deteriorated and represented poor value for what is quite an expensive hotel we will not be staying their again ,0
 everything not like the photos at all it doesnt deserve a 2 stars hotel,0
 no toilet in the room ,0
 the whole experience the staff very polite and very willing to help ,1
 poor room quality,0
 tv phone not working in room first room no bathroom neither desk,0
 i liked everything,1
 absolutely gorgeous hotel the interior was amazing the rooms lovely as well small but everything you need lovely hand written welcome message will definitely be back the location could not have been more perfect for us our favourite london hotel so far,1
 atmosphere is great like family,1
 the keeping house manager was more than perfect once i told them that the bed sheets were not that clean they upgraded the room and left me a box of chocolate ,1
 poor service door man operation non punctual elevator not working for days internet poor connection breakfast greasy and with oily smell as did not have active and clean duct operation poor cleaning of the rooms and arrogance of certain staff blame goes certainly to the gm of the hotel as poor and weak leadership results in poor operation when questioned all excuses but no fast visible action to remedy ,0
 i stay at a range of hotels from travelodge to 5 i would question whether the value added from travelodge is actually worth eg its handing of checking in out,0
 fantastic room lovely staff in restaurant v helpful luxury surroundings nice to have a pool and gym on site as well and very central,1
 the room was really tiny stuff wasn t very friendly the room was noisy due to its old windows overall a heavily overpriced place for only a single reason location ,0
 everything about the hotel was good from the service to the quality of the hotel ,1
 nice atmosphere friendly staff and our club room was very clean and comfortable 10 mins walk from paddington station 20 mins to hyde park ,1
 the staff were unfriendly the room was vey small the decor was jaded i was put in a room that had the bottom of the window backed out ,0
 this hotel is amazing friendly staff comfortable and beautiful rooms amazing view prefect location ,1
 location and breakfast ,0
 there is no sense of privacy or exclusivity in this hotel its bar and two restaurants in the lobby are open to the public and from morning till midnight the place is besieged by people of all sorts including those you d rather not see we were also surprised by the level of guests staying at the grosvenor some of them wore hoodies and a lot of them looked like from the eastenders even though we stayed at the junior suit it was tiny its air conditioning very unresponsive and some table lamps missed bulbs very long response to replace and what is it about spot lights they were glooming from the ceiling giving insufficient light in the evening they also made everyone look dreadful spotlights are for lighting up objects not people terrible atmosphere bad lighting impersonal furnishing and all this for more than 200 gbp a night oh and location is nothing to write home about it only looks close to all the attractions on the map in reality it is a long long walk from anywhere attractive do not recommend ,0
 location friendly staff ,1
 the bar was particularly comfortable and the staff were very efficient,1
 as a longtime booking com customer i have noticed that places are not always as good as the reviews lead one to believe however this place was so bad in every possible way i suspect the positive reviews cannot be true this motel is located in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood with nothing nearby i did not feel safe with my family everything is 15 minutes away walking metro coffee a bite to eat everything the hotel is dark old and had an odor i could write in the dust on the top of the shelves one of our rooms smelled like sewage we complained to the front desk but the smell remained we overlooked the hotel back alley that was cluttered with junk and the staff was kind enough to wake us up talking loudly during their 6 30 am smoke break the beds looked normal until you sat on them several inches of mattress would suddenly disappear under the lightest compression i had back problems for weeks after the visit and had to visit a physician unfortunately in the rush to leave with three small children we left our amazon kindle in the room we noticed it missing as soon as we got to the airport called the hotel and explained the exact location where it would have fallen between the bed and wall and followed up with several detailed emails of course the device was never found in the room this horrible experience does not even consider the fact that when my mother was in an accident and couldn t fly we had to fight to get the dates changed until after her recovery i understand no refunds but this should have been an easy exception and they kept the money for the additional day we did not use when we re booked it was just a horrible place all around not only will i avoid the brand at all costs in the future but i now feel that i can no longer trust booking com and i will not be using them in the future ,0
 parking facilities would of been an added bonus also more choices of different flavours of green tea ,1
 hotel and acilities,0
 front deak staff were not friendly at all we had to change our rooms twice before getting our two rooms we had booked staff in the restaurant and cleaning staff were incredibily friendly and helpful ,0
 breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night ,1
 hotel clean and in good area,1
 pool was super with jacuzzi and sauna each end love the crushed ice as well great rest to recover from the awards ceremony and party good across the water views of canary wharf,1
 hotel russell is my preferred hotel in london the piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel russell station and then you are in the central part of london close to the british museum and many historic sites the hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations the only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan ,1
 gym pool breakfast choices pillow choices view,1
 the room wasn t cleaned during our two night stay the safe didn t work the aircon didn t work the tv had no sound the concierge was rude the towels are thin and need replacing very overpriced ,0
 food,0
 anything have stayed b4 2 times and loved it this time was bad could not get food room was not and nice a old not coming back agin,0
 good value close to underground stations and an excellent breakfast,1
 carpet dirty towels old and hard in texture ditto bathrobe room tiny and no room to get ready for two people desk cluttered with coffee machine and lamp no room for any personal items no space around the bed to get in out or around no kettle only three coffee pods for two people for 24 hours hairdryer fixed to wall in bathroom and had to hold button down to keep it on no one else could use bathroom if dryer in use bathroom tiny and products second rate we were sold this room as a 5 star hotel and it isn t in any way staff sullen and no one asked if we had enjoyed our stay at end ,0
 the service,1
 location was great queensway underground station was 2 minutes away staff at the frontdesk was extremly kind and helpfull rooms were small but has everything you need ,1
 some staff can not understand english well don t know why it is a four star hotel should be two or three,0
 room too small not worth for the money i paid the room we lived is totally different from the photo showed in the website 250 per night is not worth for it ,0
 they told,0
 check in not ready noisey room newly renovated rooms look like premier inn old ones much nicer too expensive for just an uncomfortable bed,0
 so small room,0
 the doors dont have an additional lock so they close automaticly at around midnight someone walked into our room and my girlfriend woke up and started screaming and offcourse i woke then up aswell but just saw the guy leaving our room we called the staff to complain and he said nothing is wrong with the door and he cant do anything great service then i tried to put some chairs and luggage in front of the door so its not going to happen again after what happened we couldnt fall asleep anymore the hotel is very noisy and anytime we heard some noice i checked the door honestly just not right after i needed to sent 2 emails to complain i finally got an answer they said its my fault that and i probably didnt close the door right remember the automatic closing and looking door but its my fault so after i said that i want my money back they offered me a crazy discount of 25 for my next stay in their hotel no customer service we really stayed in alot of different hotel around the world but i never had such a bad customer service and experience ,0
 the hotel was central to everything i needed for my trip,1
 appalling hotel they may have low rates but it is for a reason i had to leave and find another hotel after my first night the club room one of their best rooms was tiny the location is not great with the noise of a very busy road all night the staff were nonsensical and failed to mention that there had been a power cut and that i would have no hot water it wasn t until i called down having stepped into a freezing cold shower that they said yes we are aware there is no hot water what sort of service is that i tried to get my money back with no luck as it was a non refundable booking through booking com very frustrated with the whole experience i have learned never to be fooled by the photos and read reviews before you book ,0
 we arrived earlier than check in with theatre tickets booked we were able to leave our bags etc and enjoy the show without any worries ,1
 disappointed very small size for a double room staff inconsiderate lack of basic amenities,0
 the room was spacious and love the vouchers for children s drinks ice cream great touch,1
 great location friendly staff and beautiful rooms,1
 very rude staff really dirty rooms broken air conditioning failing door key system overcharging on 4 different occasions in 7 days eg 4 breakfast charged for 5 wrong change etc etc charge for mini bar not used complete ripoff,0
 rooms were incredibly small to warrant such a star rating it is a very basic hotel it is dirty and tatty the pool is not clean with the surrounding surfaces being very grimy ,0
 location,0
 unfriendly and not collaborative personnel any request is answered with no sorry or contact the customer support per email my suggestion try some other hotel ,0
 had to pay extra for the gym and then an additional charge if i wanted a towel also the room was so noisy as the tube was directly outside the window so i have very little sleep ,0
 housekeeping took my phone but when i told the hotel they said there is no evidence so they can t do anything awful ,0
 the hotel is very old and expensive and everything wasn t working one of the lights fridge the door was stuck and can be closed and we have to wait for an hour for the maintenance to come to fix it although we called them 3 times and told them the problem that we can t leave the room and finally very expensive parking cost,0
 the room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it the toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down we ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if i ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental the taste was disgusting i swear i wanted to vomit after i ate the first bite our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for 591 instead of 561 for that night ,0
 lovely comfortable beds pillows,1
 beautiful well appointed historic building,1
 nice clean modern hotel staff good pleasant and helpful good location close to paddington underground and station room was a good size for family of 4 had to wait 10 minutes for the room due to last minute booking booked 5 minutes before turning up at the hotel was offered complimentary drinks whilst waited for room to be prepared ,1
 location rooms and staff,1
 location is excellent room was cosy ,1
 scruffy room marks and scatches everywhere,0
 friendly staff and very helpful clean room and very comfortable bed ,1
 breakfast staff big and comfortable room location are very good ,1
 the location was perfect for our stay in london will definitely stay again ,1
 i travel often to london for business and have to say this is the worst experience i have had at a hotel the television wasn t working the tablet for controling the lights was laggy and the phone had to be repaired twice something as simple as the number to call reception was nowhere to be found also reception was not very friendly ,0
 the staff were excellent the location is spot on in theatre district the rooms were lovely the air con died in the unusually hot day in london so they moved us to another room and offered refreshments as compensation the best we will return hopefully ,1
 staff are really amazing,1
 location very far from champs its about 15 mins walking housekeeping is extremely bad i used one spon on the next day after the cleaning of the room it was in the same place and it was dirty and they r not filling the toilet stuff if u ise it no more wifi is very week breakfast is very bad the staff was only one per duty at night in my 1st night i asked for slippers the receptionist told me to come down to get it ur self because he is alone then when i went down he tolded me im sorry its out of stock ,0
 the room was very cramped and noisy with the traffic and sirens the staff especially at reception were not very friendly or helpful,0
 room cleanness standard of the room as the room looked very old and the beds matters was very bad that you could feel the springs someone was somking illegal things within the floor ,0
 we had to wait 4 hrs for book in there was no option to book in early and pay more they charged us breakfast we didn t have the room never had the bare essentials we had to phone for it all the time the breakfast was not good at all the staff was not friendly or accommodating at all this is the 6th time i stayed there and use to enjoy staying there but this time it was a really bad experience,0
 try to avoid setting in the basement level bad another issue you can hear other voice,0
 great hotel location and room facilities ,1
 room was absolutely awful old and run down not very clean and smelled bad barely a window ,0
 it was great to stay in a big old hotel that has been looked after properly ,1
 bed comfy lovely shower and room,1
 loved our room it was fantastic the only thing that let it down is it was facing over a railway line and buildings so the view was a bit rubbish but that wasnt a majour issue the lady on the desk francessca i think she was called such a lovely lady and the only staff member apart from the bar staff that genuinely made us feel welcome ,1
 avoid at all costs strange rules and behaviors i ve never seen anywhere and i ve been to a lot of places i d have to spend too much time typing how awful my experience in this was and why i won t bore you too much though i ll just say that the little untrustworthy rude manager who took care of my check in late at night was awful beyond belief felt like a dark comedy of some sort really she even suggested at one point that i should giver her 150 pounds in cash even though i payed for the room beforehand because i used my fathers card to pay online i had to call him at 1 a m woke him up he had to turn on his laptop print some kind of sheet and fill it with personal details scan it back to the laptop send picturres of his credit card and number and sign everything or i d be sleeping in the streets with my room already paid for this was the tip of the iceberg that was my awful experience ps this is in hackney not shoreditch i don t know why they re ashamed of their location and then allow shady staff like that to manage anything plus the local drunks in the bar in the same counter as the reception loudly making fun of customers along with the staff wasn t very pleasant ,0
 what they consider a family studio is a bad joke i ve stayed in single rooms in tokyo that were significantly larger just adding a cheap sofa bed to a small room does not make it a studio suitable for families i agreed with the front desk that they would at least close and open it every day as otherwise we could barely move around the room use the desk or open the refrigerator they failed to do so every single day without our going to reception to complain and then wait a further half hour people were pleasant and apologized profusely but service is horrible the restaurant is also way too small for the volume of people with waits up to 15 20 minutes to seat for breakfast even with overflow to the lounge areas i learned an important lesson about putting too much faith in online reviews which seemed mostly positive i assume those will drop quickly once more guests share their experiences ,0
 we were positioned in lg1 lower ground where people could see through the window should the curtains be open and we were lying in bed not a big problem but the main air con wasn t working and it seemed we had a standing air con unit next to the bed this air con unit generated more heat from the side than the cool air it could produce making the room a sauna we could open the window but have to keep the thick curtains closed for any sort or privacy meaning no cold air would pass through we were up several times in the night for cold showers sleepless night,0
 clean and comfortable beds,1
 the breakfast room was lovely and theatre bar was fun,1
 dated decor generally drab the owners have obviously stopped trying ,0
 the room was clean and comfortable facilities in the room were very good two hairdryers ,1
 the restaurant was excellent and service extremely good ,1
 the room was an upgrade and very nice ,1
 we were upgraded to a suite overlooking the london eye which was fantastic staff were lovely especially in the restaurant very friendly and helpful the central location meant that is is possible to walk everywhere if you feel inclined ,1
 ridiculously small single room containing shabby furniture dirty glassware and a tiny rock hard bed clearly no thought at all given to comfort of guests ,0
 we were mother and daughter away for a few days in london the room was comfortable and very quiet ideal for chilling out after a hard day exploring ,1
 location,1
 tiny room location no fridge again tiny room when i arrived the air conditioner had been working for a few hours at least and it was freezing in the room and the air conditioner didn t work with warmer temperature there was an additional rubber sheet on the bed very uncomfortable ,0
 the room was very small we expected a family room for 2 adults 1 child to be a bit more spacious paying extra for the use of the pool was also disappointing ,0
 the lack of detail to minor things for example grubby sofa stains in bed no iron some bathroom facilities were broken or hanging off ,0
 la situation le breakfast,1
 free upgrade including breakfast was great but would have been great value anyway restaurant staff very knowledgeable about food allergens which is rare as well ,1
 marble stair case no road noise friendly staff,1
 booked the junior suite and was expecting a separate living dining area as suggested in the photos however recieved a large room with a sofa location is pretty poor they do offer a shuttle service to and from stations however this had a tendancy to run late over the two nights we stayed constant loud musuc being played next door spa facilities mediocre staff not very engaging or friendly requested house keeping after the first night whilst we were out only to return to minimal cleaning no fresh towels bath had not been cleaned shower was cold and the attempt at fancy gadgets such as lighting temperature control via the tv seem to be unescessary and more hassle than it s worth overall not very impressed will be unlikely to return ,0
 best nights sleep in a hotel ever ,1
 staff were very attentive felt really looked after as we were chosen as guest of the day free room upgrade and drinks room was clean and spacious ,1
 liz on reception went the extra mile hotel opened the market brasserie an hour early on o2 show night to facilitate preshow eating very knowledgeable efficient and helpful doorman marvellous breakfast buffet one of the best i have seen ,1
 restaurants nearby,1
 excellent service 1st class staff great location,1
 the price,1
 staff unhelpful especially the reception no care in the room the lights in the room do not match some are white some are yellow dusty and sometimes you feel you are in two star hotel ,0
 room with fitted carpets that need to be replaced noisy room because it was close to the maid s room bed matress probably too old smelling sweat,0
 i was put at my arrival at the shaftsbury park garden as an upgrade single room with single bed but at as i was the last time at the shaftesbury paddington was the single room with no single bed the room and bathroom were bigger at the paddington and it is closer to the paddington station the single rooms can be only reached be small stairs at the paddington with an elevator as i asked for a bigger room and i would pay for the upgrade they said that this is not possible in my opinion a downgrade for this price ,0
 nothing was too much trouble for the staff it is a beautiful place contemporary yet comfortable will definitely be returning ,1
 there was a private function in the lovely relaxing lounge area so we couldn t go in there which was a shame as it was a lovely room to sit and have a drink in ,0
 excellent staff serena who checked us in was very friendly and professional,1
 everthing especially the staff they should teach other hotels what a good customer service is all about every signal staff was welcoming smiling and will do anything to make the guest happy we only stayed there for 2 nights to attend a concert for adele but you can tell good service when you see it ,1
 mosty everything ,0
 terrible please that needs a massive refurb and staff that actually want to help rooms are sooo small and look like something out of a museum,0
 noise of lifts kept us awake and people knocking on door from 12 6am around 6 7 times then being woken at 8 30 by room service even with do not disturb sign on really bad experience all in all booking said breakfast included which wasn t and charged at 21 50 per person on site reservation for parking could not be done in advance and no mention of congestion charges poor booking experience through yourselves,0
 great location short walk to tube or bus ,1
 shower didn t work quite well bath not clean enough breakfast was terrible,0
 bed was extra comfy staff were super helpful,1
 the staff were excellent all round and very happy to help you with anything always said hello the doormen were particularly good and the overall level of service and friendliness was the best i have had loved to be able to open the windows fully as it was very warm and opening the windows enabled a pleasant comfortable sleep excellent position from tube station i deal 24 hours shop across the road lots of places to eat breakfast around the hotel ,1
 paid for a superior room and there was nothing superior about it asked for more milk and sugar for tea and coffee and they couldn t supply any and didn t bother to find any even the next day staff quite rude and not very helpful ,0
 house keeping was horrible bed mattress uncomfortable everything was not excellent,0
 in a two week trip through 3 countries this was the only bad hotel accommodation and it was the worst i have ever experienced at this level hotel in us or abroad the rooms were awful the bed and pillows were hard as rocks it was so hot in all 3 rooms we tried a c broke in first room moved from a suite to a twin after begging for a room with a c originally told they didn t have another room they were going to force us to stay in the broken a c room and rent the one we ended up in probably we were lied to repeatedly hot in the new room as well and 3 of us on 2 twins pushes together at 3 am i had to go to desk and ask for fans next time we had a room with a loft for the bathroom and double bed the loft was so hot it was on the top floor heat rises there was a small box a c that ran continuously but never cooled off the room there was a crying baby in the next room that sounded like it was in the room with us the traffic outside was so loud in the room as well that happened in 2 of the 3 rooms there were 2 green lights on the ceiling of the loft i think to light up the stairs that stayed on permanently and it was like daylight in the bedroom it had a skylight with no cover so at the crack of dawn more light streamed in after repeated attempts with management we had prepaid in full so they didn t care we literally left in the middle of the night and went to a much more expensive but lovely cool quiet beautiful hotel to get one good night s sleep in london it was the best move we made and we should have left after the first incident this is our 4th trip to london always in the heat of summer and the only bad experience we have ever had with our hotel accommodations i have never had to complain to management about a hotel room before in london after over 20 nights worth of accommodations management was barely apologetic ,0
 good location for sadlers wells friendly staff ,1
 bathrooms were extremely dirty and unclean it seems that the house cleaning staff are not doing their job or the management is not keeping a tab on the flew knees of the rooms the first bedroom on the 5th floor where i stayed first night was extremely noisy very poor experience ,0
 the bed was very comfortable the location was perfect the staff were friendly and very helpful absolutely loved our stay at this hotel,1
 windows painted shut dangerous room dirty ac not working floor boards upstairs v load ,0
 great location only a few minutes walk from hammersmith underground and bus stations on site carparking available despite being a large hotel the desks were always fully manned resulting in very little waiting when checking in or out good access to free computers and unusually in my experience a working printer ,1
 beds were fantastic cleanliness excellent rooms almost faultless ,1
 midgety rooms wi fi was a joke ,0
 great location for exploring london friendly and accommodating staff ,1
 good location for hyde park and central line tube station to west end less than 5 mins walk ,1
 great location friendly and helpful staff comfortable room ,1
 everything was bad bed was broken toilet was not flushing and ac was broken overall stay poor,0
 pillows were a little too thin,1
 breakfast was not good and hotel receptionists are not helpful ,0
 i was given a room in the basement of the park hotel which was dark noisy and very small the small window looked out onto a small yard filled with rubbish however the breakfast was adequate and the staff were polite ,0
 customer relations was great to the girls at the front desk all the guys of concierge the room service crew the massage therapist at the spa and last but not least the incredible kim she was kind happy spirit and always had a smile on her face her compassion towards people was superb thumbs up to a great hotel ,1
 we never received the daily paper delivery we requested for our four night stay closet is very small ,0
 location facilities concierge servce all of them,1
 lifts out of order no one to say they were not working no one helping lift luggage as the lifts were out of order breakfast service was slow and not communicated well 1 room was crazy hot the heat sensors were not working i got a heat rash as it was so hot whole place could do with a lick of paint roomcards had stopped working for one room ,0
 nice quiet place and good for resting,1
 definitely geared up for business travellers and i would consider staying here for business in the future this trip was for pleasure the staff were very friendly and helpful we had booked a standard room but on arrival were advised that we had been upgraded to an executive room which was a great surprise the review is therefore based on this but if we were to go back again we d be more than tempted to go for the upgrade anyway location was perfect for visiting nearby family central london and theatre land is a decent tube journey away but completely do able from here and allowed for a relaxed stay without being in the middle of the madness the whole time ,1
 the staffs are friendly helpful we got our room upgrade to club clean,1
 the night staff a french man was not helpful at all he wouldn t print up a receipt for me and wanted to charge me 20 to use a british converter plug i told him i didn t need to use one since i had brought my own upon check out i did get the young lady leticia to print my receipt without any problems location of this hotel isn t great there s not many restaurants near it it s a bit cut off ,0
 very friendly and helpful staff they are the back bone of the hotel,1
 room is clean and comfortable staffs are nice ,1
 we upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub ,1
 what a wonderful experience we had at the intercontinental the staff were extremely welcoming friendly efficient in their job roles particularly shauna when we checked in and pedro in the clipper bar i booked this hotel as my husband and i were seeing a show at the o2 for his birthday the staff at the hotel went above and beyond to make my husbands special day even better by giving us a lovely corner room with river view and a delicious cake and birthday message in the room for our arrival it was such a lovely touch and we really appreciated it the location of the hotel is perfect if you re going to the o2 and really makes the experience extra special highly recommend it thanks intercontinental see you soon ,1
 theatre bar was cool,1
 the location was great and the staff very friendly ,1
 the location was great for catching the tube and only one stop from king s cross the staff were extremely friendly and helpful plus there was an excellent breakfast ,1
 i do not recommend this property it loud messy dirty i could not sleep a single night ,0
 we booked a 3 night stay in a suite on arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places during the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 i went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened it turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room he came to apologise with a feeble excuse i tripped and fell into the door we didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us i asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was we went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with no it wasn t i came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them i phoned them up to complain and the money was returned however i have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel ,0
 excellent service,1
 poor variety breakfast very very narrow corridors the size of the rooms is so small actually tiny staff were ok not so helpful there was hair on the new sheets when we just enter the room after check in nevertheless the price is sooo expensive,0
 very comfy bed nice and clean room and not too far away from kings cross station ,1
 excellent ,1
 trap this hotel deserves a 2 or maximum 3 stars the location is super bad the reception is smelly the breakfast is poor if you think this is a 4 star hotel think again ,0
 i dislike the indifference of the staff attitude towards costumer s demands,0
 location and staff,1
 the room was a single room sold as a double there was not room for us to both walk in it more suitable for backpackers hugely over priced and not work the money at all overall hotel is tired but the room has to be the worse i have ever stay i didn t even bother to stay for breakfast ,0
 a beautifully presented hotel set in an amazing location two minute walk from the best attractions in london staff were very friendly and the rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfy ,1
 torn carpet tiny bathroom very tired d cor no iron ironing board available when needed early in the morning definitely not a 4 star hotel ,0
 fabulous hotel great location and the best bed i ve slept in for ages ,1
 everything from the moment we arrived to the moment we left wonderful friendly staff luxurious stay in a very clean room with a fantastic view ,1
 given a room that was not ready and moved to another room without dovet i came at thre and cleaners were working and rubish all over the place ,0
 staff was not really friendly at the arrival furthermore the room was extremely small i couldn t even open my trolley as there was no space ,0
 room picture is misleading i resereved a studio which doesn t look like the picture at all in both size wise and furniture wise the room was too small with very old furniture the veiw of the room was horrible room 211 ,0
 didn t like the ambiance carpet pillow bed toilet all had stains if you don t want to spoil your holiday mood try going elsewhere and not to this property i have visited this property multiple times but this time i ve decided not to go there anymore they just don t want to improve there are far better place to stay in the neighborhood ,0
 outside dirty room small cramped could not even walk around bed room grubby dirty bathroom shower moldy breakfast poor not value for money 2 start not 4 star,0
 i discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout upon checkout i was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings as of now now communication have been made ,0
 we were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite as part of that you get access to the club lounge the room was lovely looked as new comfy bed very clean and the club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available 24hrs ,1
 great service stunning hotel despite being under construction lovely restaurant and a quiet surrounding ,1
 food was excellent in the restaurant and the breakfast in the morning very friendly and efficient staff,1
 this was suppose to be a 4 star first of all it was very old and under construction and it was not indicated the facility nothing was working every single person was staying there was complaining it was not worth the money at all it is more like a one star hotel ,0
 room was dirty windows so dirty could not see out shower door leaked water and floor flooded loud music played at night when in bed,0
 superb location and facilities top notch staff were polite and keen but see negatives for levels of training and management peninsula restaurant food was superb ,1
 comfortable clean room good breakfast in a good position for access in the area ,1
 everything was perfect very clean superb facilities friendly staff the most comfortable bed i ever slept on ,1
 the furnishings and decor of the standard double room with windows looked tired and the room could do with a make over because the dark wood furniture with scratches and blue striped wallpaper with marks on it isn t very appealing the bathroom needs an upgrade the mirrors show signs of age one them was going brown along the sides and the chrome mirror finish was affected the air con didn t cool the room and when switched on the non smoking room then had faint smelt of cigarettes location is near the dlr and the train noise could be heard we could also hear the people in the room next door talking and taking part in erm well things you do in bed at night that make the bed knock against the wall ,0
 very poor check in was horrible checking out was also horrible person who checked us out tried to charge us extras for things we did not get the rooms were barely cleaned just the bed and bathrooms ,0
 the location our favorite area of london,1
 no air con and a smell of smoke in the room we could only heat the room with the system that was in the room so we had to leave a window open and then got hard to sleep with the noise from the traffic there was always a smell of cigarettes in the room ,0
 our keycard stopped working several times during our stay reception never answered promptly when called from the room tried to use room service and the staff redirected my calling abruptly without letting me know what was happening and then room service itself never answered furthermore why the need to be redirected in the first place when the number gave the impression i would be put straight through to room service the air conditioning in the room was not up to standard it was either too hot or too cold even when we adjusted it an extra bed was provided with the room but no extra blankets or bedding for it overall very unsatisfactory hotel ,0
 the after noon high tea and having the beds turned down at night after a busy day great room service of food which was beautifully presented fresh flowers in room and real orchid plants every were ,1
 unprofessional personal view on a construction site rooms are really far from the elevator,0
 location view facilities,1
 the stuff who served us is very nice very enjoyable journey in this hotel ,1
 in this hotel we were robbed they stole new things from the room the hotel did not recognize this the video refused to show the police refused to call we went to the police ourselves the criminal case of a theft in the hotel is instituted i do not recommend this hotel ,0
 great location lovely clean room with the comfiest bed and amazing big bath tub ,1
 restaurant is smelly ducting is very bad staff are rude the room refrigerator is smelly the room is not like pictures on the net ,0
 easy to find near paddington station and room was nice and comfortable ,1
 stayed in newly refurbished rooms excellent,1
 staff were superb especially mr joy who treated our girls very well well located equidistant between paddington and lancaster gate tube stations ,1
 old poor look facilities looks bad,0
 as you know the prices of our reservation were as follows double room non smoking 486 36 10 vat is included 48 64 price 535 but the hotel of holiday inn paris gare de l est charged my clients for 834 80 and this is not fair i will send you the payment factor for your information as a seperate mail ,0
 great breakfasts and very nice people,1
 room size extremely small and not similar to photos on booking com,0
 ac made way too much noise the rooms are quite small house keeping a bit rude he handed mw the duvet and told me to out the cover myself we had to ask for towels more than once the bathroom not very clean and not even basic channels on tv the bathroom door kept getting jammed and bathroom extract fan did not work ,0
 correct,0
 clean stylish comfortable well located ,1
 the hotel itself is very grand traditional and looks fantastic the deluxe room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with great facilities the staff are friendly and dressed as grand as the hotel is the location is perfect for tourists being a 30 second walk from kensington gardens and a couple minutes away from the nearest tube ,1
 very rude staff at the reception and in the restaurant no free wifi in the rooms i was promised with the river view room but got a room with a disgusting inner yard view impossible to set the right water temperature in bathroom breakfast area was dirty and hot and smelled sweat no drinking water in the room 4 seriously extremely needs renovation,0
 very friendly staff good all round hotel,1
 i was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about 2 3 unlikely to return on this hotel all the while i thought i could experience 5 star experience it was not i was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the 5 star hotels i been through for a 270 a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby,0
 the room via booking com was awful drab and smelt of cigarette smoke and puts me off using booking com in future it was clearly the cheapest worst and most depressing room they had on offer i asked to be moved it was that bad which they did the next room was better but still disappointing and below par as compared to the wonderful reviews high rating and glossy hotel photos although the hotel was a bit further out than i wanted i thought it would be worth it as i was hoping for a special romantic weekend with my partner before my work trip began this was all very disappointing the toilet then got blocked the next day so we had to be moved at which point they did upgrade us to a room which did look like the photos on display this was the type of room i expected in the first place and i did not appreciate the rigamarole to get it i will not be staying there again in future and am very apprehensive to use booking com which i have used faithfully for many years ,0
 very slow service noisy ventilation in room poorly maintained lifts poor customer service when made complaint about noisy fan ,0
 ac not working gave us seperate bed even though they saw a couple did not ask if we wanted smoking non smoking room ordered a iron came very late not worth the money had better luxury for the price,0
 everything value for money,1
 never had so worse 4 star hotel hotel room was half broken curtain couldn t close blistered paint on the wall air conditioning didn t work ceiling of shower almost came down ,0
 no self equipments tea coffee in room ,0
 the property needs to invest in sound proof windows it felt like i was sleeping right in the middle of the street the room were less than average ,0
 basically every thing based on my 1st experience with them from 23 to 25 i did not come back to them and i booked another hotel where i loss my mony since my reservation with them is not refundable about 900 kd,0
 we loved the traditional appearance in the foyer lounge and bar the rooms were modern and very clean ,1
 great location room was spacious d cor nice good room service ,1
 this is not 4 star hotel maybe 2 but only because location bed is from last century room was in basement small even for uk standards will not even think to come again ,0
 location is good about 8 mins walk to the tube but also close to st pauls cathedral and the river room was very clean and the bathrooms was very nice ,1
 good location and easy to access most sight seeing ,1
 clean fresh well appointed rooms very tidy in a great location,1
 the bed was very comfortable room was quite big with enough space to move around it was also very silent no noise from outside or other rooms location was fabulous very nice area and near two metro stations very close to the park for daily morning exercise,1
 the staff were helpful and friendly ,1
 staff were incompetent and provided no real service had no handle on who their guests were at one point we were asked how our stay was we arrived 40mins earlier and he checked us in room was scruffy and not what i d expect for a prince s square hotel in west london felt like it was updated 20yrs ago and then they ve given up because you ll always be fully booked in that location finally and probably most importantly the bed was horrific so uncomfortable neither of us slept well for our entire stay ,0
 the room had been recently renovated in a modern style we found it very attractive but it might disappoint others if they were looking for the victorian style of the public areas these were beautifully ornate with dark paneling and decorated ceilings the one way street was residential with large well maintained victorian houses now mostly flats it was very quiet a range of local food shops and restaurants was within easy walking distance along with a circle line underground station it was easy to travel to the theatre via the circle line we had booked room only so cannot comment on the food ,1
 superb location starting with london eye and westminster abbey big ben and some more within short walking distance public transportation and train stops also very close ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation i guess staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting magda on reception our cleaning lady nadia and one member i think sarah at the breakfast ,1
 the bed is awful lot s of noise from the frame the shower broked entrance not welcoming elevator and the corridors is so disgusting,0
 we have stayed in many central london hotels and this was the worst value ever for 220 per night we had a superior room with a shower room so small the wash basin was in the bedroom the mini kitchen only had a microwave and china over what any decent hotel room has the room was small and the double bed even smaller though clean there were holes in the sheets the heating cooling fan was so loud you could not sleep with it on best of all you could clearly hear conversations in the neighbouring room and when other rooms ran water it was like an express train rushing through the room i could go on but you get the idea ,0
 rooms really lovely,1
 the ambience of the hotel was very good very good staff position very good,1
 the location makes you feel unsecure there were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel the hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway ,0
 location wasn t very good very hot inside and looks shabby and dark,0
 location of room 163 was not ok for me ,0

 where do we begin room far to small for twin beds very hot and clostophobic thread bare and loose carpets worn bathroom fittings decor in need of total referb,0
 they overbooked the hotel when we arrived there was a large gap under the door which made us feel the room was lacking in privacy the bathroom was actually caked in dust under the sink i saw this because i dropped a soap the shower didn t have a curtain or screen so water gushed everywhere the shower head also didn t stay in place everything about the place felt cheap and budget the rooms are tiny and it felt unclean i would have rather stayed in a holiday inn or premier inn worst hotel i ve ever stayed at ,0

 room very clean spacious comfortable,1
 i stayed at the novotel suites montreuil one week with my disabled boyfriend i honestly don t know how this hotel could be a 4 stars hotel rooms are not well manteined not clean bath and shower were stained and not clean the area is very shady and sketchy not good for walking or wandering around especially for girls there is no restaurant in the hotel and is very difficult to find a good one around there is also no service whatever you need towels soap etc you need to go down to reception ask for it and get it yourself cleaning ladies would just come into the room without even knocking they did so repeatedly one morning they came in 5 times despite we told them not to the personnel at the reception changes a lot and apart from one nice blond lady the rest of them were not helpful not kind not nice i definitely wouldn t suggest this hotel to anyone bad bad experience ,0

 1 room assigned last room available although the reaervation was made weeks in advance was on the top floor and near the skybar which although was closed it continued to be a source of nuisance with people moving bottles in the afternoons 2 showers and tv did not work on arrival and the bathtub stopper did not work 3 one day upon returning to the room the door had been left open after the room was cleaned highly not acceptable 4 manager and staff offered no apology to the inconveniences i complained so that others would not face similar treatment not to be offered a chsnge of room when and if one becomes available ,0

 the size of the room and the view was like staying in a dungeon,0
 excellent breakfast,1
 air con working,0
 they ve gave me the room and when i went there there were naked people in the room apparently they gave me the wrong room than they changed it ,0
 the bed linen had not been changed as we discovered having returned after being out to celebrate our wedding anniversary the bed sheets were marked and there were many obvious pubic hairs throughout the bed the pillow cases smelled of previous users there was nobody available at reception to raise the matter at the time 11 30pm so we ended up sleeping on top of the duvet the following morning we made a complaint to the manager and were subsequently offered a refund of 25 which is unsatisfactory we have photographs of the incident but have not currently published these ,0
 room small and cramped no view and tucked away down an isolated corridor wi fi poor and intermittent good location and proximity to tube station this kind of failure makes we seriously question why i should remain a member of the hilton honours club ,0
 the room smelt of gas shower did not have water no one helped us,0
 nice bar friendly staff,1
 great location nice restaurant very comfy beds liked the ice maker on every floor really handy little kitchenette in the room good sound and light proofing great view over london ,1

 little rooms bad breakfast no parking too little bed,0

 how noisy the hotel was the carpets must have needed replacing about 3 years ago they are so worn that it is almost a health hazard the place is also very dirty rooms and halls bathrooms are a bit cleaner although my shower would not drain properly so i had to limit my shower to 3 4 minutes in order to avoid overfill flooding this was my 2nd stay and my last stay ,0
 there are a lot of noise,0
 comfortable room with a good bathroom all clean and comfy ,1
 false advertisement of how big the rooms are room was tiny and one receptionest was very rude the room with a view does not point out that you have stick your head out of the window to actually see the view ,0
 aircondition in one of our two rooms was not working and reparation was delayed three days without result then we shifted to another room with the same problem bad service incidence of weekly street market which lies just beside the hotel was unfortunately unlucky for us because of a lot of noise and traffic problems ,0

 small dirty rooms to open the wc door must jump in the shower no space to move in the rooms worst breakfast ever to have eggs and bacon and can beens must pay extra the stuff is friendly enough but that s not enough for a hotel to work it s too expensive with no facilities not even a bottle of water in the empty mini bar not even a bath robe while sleeping you can hear what s happening to all the other rooms ,0
 staff extremely courteous and helpful very comfortable room close to theatre district and covent garden great breakfast ,1
 reception concierge ,1
 everyone friendly tried hard to acknowledge my mums birthday and upgraded our rooms excellent location and would recommend the hotel to anyone,1
 receptionist,1
 i had prepaid in advance to be told on admission that my bill was an extra 120 pounds i showed them my receipt and they still couldn t explain the extra cost but suggested it was a city tax when i asked them to please clarify exactly what the additional cost was a supervisor told me it was because i asked for a quiet room i was travelling with a small child so i don t know what they expected they finally agree it was already paid in full but brought us up a room in an area that is in need of a major facelift as the lift stopped working and the decor was dated and scruffy not what i expected from a hotel of this supposed standard ,0

 we liked the location of the hotel and it s proximity to padfdington station it s in a quaint residential neighborhood the staff at the front desk was friendly and accommodating the room was nice and modern also very clean ,1
 bed was hard as a rock worst nights sleep ever bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it no breakfast included and already paid 141 pound to stay never staying again ,0

 dark room with dark furniture no restaurant too high price for that value,0
 this hotel is in need of a major refurb smelly corridors water marks in the room worn carpets twin rooms do have 2 single beds in them but they are really narrow and right next to each other so you need to be good friends with your room mate i asked for a different room but was advised that i had the biggest ,0

 the staff are friendly and breakfast is plentiful we had a nespresso machine in the room which was frequently used ,1

 location and room were great,1
 the fact that i had booked this hotel in january and asked for quiet adjoining rooms with good views and we didn t get any of theses instead we got one room in the basement witch was very dark as it had a very small obscure window witch looked out on to the bin area that accounted for the smell witch wafted around the area outside our room this is were the staff had there break who were all very noisy talking late at night i phoned reception to complain about the noise it took them 5 min to answer the phone in witch he left me hanging on the line while he went to tell them to be quiet we could still hear them after he told them to be quiet only they had lowered there voices my daughter was running the london marathon the next day and needed her rest that is why i asked for a quiet room my sister in laws room was much brighter with patio doors witch were a joke as they should of led onto a patio area but there was huge tanks and pipes every were why they would have these doors in this room when you can t even go out side so much for asking for a room with a view also the next morning i asked if there was a courtesy room for my daughter to use after the marathon to take a shower but they said they didn t have one most hotels do have courtesy rooms not good will i be returing to the shafsbury hotel no way ,0
 the elevator serves is too crowed the out door servicers is not accept carry my things and help because he said no assist with him,0
 i really don t believe this is a 4star hotel it s like 2star we very go back there ,0
 pictures not real room is too small and furniture not as shown on the app i wouldn t book in this hotel not worth the money comparing with other international brands i would give the 4 out of 10,0
 the hotel was not even close to four stars maybe two but only because of the location the accommodations were very cramped they did not supply wash clothes instead they used disposable clothes much like a clorox clean up you walk directly into the bathroom when up enter the room so if you re in the shower the person entering the room will get a show too the coffee cups weren t washed they both had remnants of a prior guest s lipstick on them as did the teaspoons the water in the coffee pot was left for days without the housekeeping service ever looking at it leaving it with a stale smell and film on it the carpets weren t vacuumed nor were the chair cushions ever fluffed or turned the fabric on the chairs dust ruffle and foot blanket were all worn faded and tattered on the edges and the ultimate worst part of the stay if you could stomach the accommodations was the constant jack hammering that persisted from 7 30 8 00 am until 5 00pm everyday with the exception of saturday and sunday which the staff did absolutely nothing about completely disinterested in helping several of the guests dealing with issue and tried to say that moving to another room would be better fyi moving to another room was just as loud as it was in our room and every other room in this hotel we originally tried to cancel our reservation because we had an opportunity to stay in northern france but the contract that we had through booking com would not allow us to do so without losing all the money we paid for the 5 night stay booking com stated that we could ask the hotel for a refund and of course the hotel stated they would keep our prepaid 5 night deposit well now we know why they couldn t get anyone to take the room if they gave them away coupled with the constant jack hammering it was truly one of the most unfortunate situations when you re on holiday to have to stay at this hotel,0
 i m very pleased that we choose to stay at intercontinental london park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment i already rated the property 10 but what i really wanted to mention here is the concierge micheal petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc we felt so spoiled this time thanks to them i totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our hotels in the gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an english breakfast like any other hotel we are totally booking in it again ,1
 everything except the staff,0
 good comfortable rooms relaxing and very good location,1
 the bathroom was tatty and the whole hotel was a mess and dirty due to the building work ,0
 the front office was impolite and not professional and the house keeping is very very bad the breakfast is very poor and the area is not even good for a 1 star hotel ,0
 rooms were great great location,1
 everything absolutely nothing to fault except we thought our room was a little cold at night,1
 i was very disappointing with this hotel despite reading positive reviews my visit did not reflect this we stayed in room 11 on the 1st floor and i must say i was shocked at the standard from the second i walked in the room was very dark with hardly any sunlight no soundproofing it was very noisy you could hear people talking clearly in other rooms and walking up and down the stairs our tv didn t work and despite reporting it twice the staff where reluctant to do anything about it until we insisted on a discount on the room charge if they didn t room service only put new towels and did not remove the old ones lay the bed or clean the bathroom being a frequent visitor to paris and having stayed in several other hotels in the area this by far does not live up to it s 4 star rating ,0
 lovely clean room good shower modern accommodation staff were all very helpful and friendly lovely bar area we were made to feel very welcome throughout our stay ,1
 the bathroom is disgusting the wc is in seperate place the shower is too small and bath tub fittings were almost expire and broken poor value of money and waste of time the cleaning staff were with bad attitude and disrespectful they don t even bother to pick extra tissue paper from the carpet or dispose used paper cups ,0
 the rooms should have had shades or drapes that darkened the room our room was light at four am drapes did not fit prime purpose of staying there was to sleep when informed we were promptly moved to another room for the second night very dark corridors,0
 comfy bed,1
 at check in front desk wanted to put me at a sister hotel that was farther away from the conference center they were likely overbooked the temperature in my room was ridiculously hot the thermostat did not work despite my turning it all the way down to 16 degrees celsius i called front desk and was assured someone will swing by to rectify the issue four nights at the hotel and nobody bothered to address my complaint it felt like sleeping in a sauna ,0
 we had stayed in this hotel before and thought it was good returned to find we were given a room that smelled and had dampness all over the wall and asked to change rooms we were given a new room which wasn t much better walls were dirty the curtains were falling down and there was dust all over the chair which was not cleaned for our stay 3days awful experience we will never stay there again ,0
 very outdated and not too clean very shabby looking,0
 air con didn t work asked for service to fix different issues nothing was done done staff were rude no city view as per our booking house keeping was slack and not up to standard ,0
 breakfast room size and cleaniness,0
 very welcoming friendly staff very clean and good quality furnished room ,1
 the electricity was completely gone had to take shower in the dark can not charge the phone nothing is fixed a nightmare stat of 2 nights ,0
 unfortunately we had some money stolen from our room approx 300 00 and when reported to the staff they informed us that an investigation would be done and get back to us after 24 hrs no response regarding the investigation and as our insurance would cover us for only 100 lost in cash we have not made a claim i explained to them that obviously they have staff working for them who are thieves and their response was well you should have locked your money in the safe provided very poor attitude and i will be writing to their manager requesting a full report on their investigation but safe to say we will never stay there again when we visit paris regards mike and marita o connor ,0
 beautiful gothic hotel very good location some nice bars and restaurants fabulous thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from dam centre really enjoyed staying there there was building work ongoing but you would never have know ,1
 too expensive,0
 i was not informed at the time of booking and paying the full cost of accommodation that the hotel was undergoing noisy refurbishment the room had opaque film over the window which opened just a crack to look out onto scaffolding and sheeting which covered the whole of the front of the hotel the lighting system was faulty we were moved to another room after we shared our concerns which was even worse again screening over a window which didn t open it was like being in a prison cell despite requesting a bath this room had shower only ,0
 i liked the jester of complimentary fruit and magazines in the room ,1
 air condition was noisy pillows were lumpy i changed the room twice but as you were full i had to have the first room anyway the second room was cold and the shower room floor icy ,0
 the room was tiny with a very small and uncomfortable,0

 broken elevator no wi fi broken a c controller extremely small rooms,0
 hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although i prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium and for all that i paid 250 never again ,0
 the helpfulness of staff ,1
 central location,1
 the staff are cooperative,1
 hotel for group tour many people at breakfast restaurent very busy hotel uncomfort bed no pub due to arab community,0
 the location is very convenient but quiet my husband and i were traveling with our adult daughter and were able to book a connecting room for her she had a completely separate room but we did not have to pay double the price of one room the rooms were large by european standards ,1
 great location nicely decorated,1
 where do i start the ants in my first room i was moved to another with none bathroom drains that were very slow to drain water very very old and needing to be replaced carpeting chipped and old furniture lock on the door did not work this hotel needs a major overhaul or a wrecking ball ,0
 the front desk person was extremely unprofessional and dishonest i was charged on my credit card although i had paid cash and repeated several time i did not want to have my card charged i was promised by him that it will be credited it back on my credit card but i just received my monthly bill with the amount on it i now have to follow it up with my bank and go through the nuisance of proving it all very disappointing and unethical customer service ,0
 worst boutique hotel i have stayed in it was more like a travel lodge plus had no pillowcases as they had problem with their cleaning ,0
 we were advised that we had been upgraded to a suite i do not believe the room we were given was a suite we had to go across the road and down to a basement level room that appeared to be easily accessible through a fire escape stairs on the street this unguarded fire escape with apparently access to the street made me nervous of passing walking traffic,0
 customer services needs to be improved absolutely disappointed,0

 breakfast,1
 i had a bad experience with this hotel during check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me i felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system so i decided to to turn the table against them so i request from woman in front desk to show me the room for testing the water heating system by my self suddenly her supervisor came i forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel it clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests during that an european guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly i start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality what a shame so the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location later they change the room i will never book again in this hotel ,0
 beautiful building friendly reception staff and barman we didn t have breakfast so cant comment on restaurant the location is super near tube stations ,1

 amazing value for money very helpful staff superb location right next to tube station even received s birthday surprise in our room thank you very much hotel russell x,1
 great location around the corner from tube station good selection at breakfast ,1
 jean could possibly do with some hospitality course he was cold and rude from the moment go and the hotel has absolutely no view well the toilets are small the sofa seats in the room are torn and the location isn t tempting the lift in the hotel is in a dire state and require a schindler or any standard lift to replace it if you would love to stay in a dungeon this is a perfect horror home the chain shouldn t be lending its name to such a hotel ,0
 very comfortable hotel ideal location for 02 and london city excellent breakfast very friendly and efficient staff could not rate this hotel highly enough and will be staying with them again,1
 rude staff no room service bad value for money,0
 beetles or black ladybirds and spiders crawling on the walls and inside the curtains i went to reception and spoke to the night manager telling him about the problem he immediately handed me a tin of insect spray when i went back up to the room to spray i saw just how many insects there were there were many insects i went back again to the front desk to complain and inform the night manager he could clearly not care less he refused to help me not wanting to do anything to solve the problem he didn t even want to come and look at the room there was no other staff member available to help i felt very belittled and frustrated as he refused to listen or even acknowledge the problem finally and after shouting at me that i didn t care about the other hotel guests and being generally abusive he begrudgingly went to have a look once in the room he continued to be rude aggressive dismissive even accusing my teenage daughter of lying i told him we couldn t sleep in a room with an insects and asked for a new room or a cancellation of the booking he said he wouldn t do either wouldn t and couldn t speak to his boss and we shouldn t worry as these particular insects are not carnivores obviously we had no choice but to leave and felt aggressed and unwelcome by the night manager on leaving the hotel i paid for the room by credit card the night manager then refused to give give me any kind of receipt of payment he started screaming and shouting at me in french something along the lines of i have no right to use the informal way to speak i would like to point out i am english and don t speak fluent french i was trying to communicate the best i could he then closed the sliding doors of the hotel entrance from behind the counter locking us inside the hotel holding us hostage so we couldn t leave he refused to open them my teenage daughter was very distressed it was a horrific situation ,0
 used it as a crash pad for a night while on business front of house was efficient and helpful twin room slept well room felt modern and well equiped room was quiet with window internal to hotel courtyard ,1

 400gbp full price and we got it for 120 this can t be true the whole experience seemed like it should be a 90 a night type of place the gym pool needs to close down seriously it s in a bad way horrible to be in staff were very rude and didn t seem to enjoy being there breakfast was i hate to say dreadful it was honestly like something out of ramsay s kitchen nightmares chips were on the buffet at breakfast booking com said this room was valued at it was a shocker i m afraid britannia ,0
 i have stayed in this hotel multiple times in the last few years and always i leave with the intension of returning very helpful staff great location excellent breakfast nice rooms ,1
 good staff good room,1
 very small room with one bed you can hardly move without touching the walls the bathroom was small but clean ,0
 lovely room and breakfast,1
 i was entirely underwhelmed by my experience staying at this property though the location is fantastic many negative factors came into play my wife and i arrived early in paris and left our bags with the valet when we returned to pick up our room keys at 2 pm we had to wait for 30 minutes as only two people were there not only checking in guests but acting as concierge at the same time when we finally did get our room keys they said they would have someone bring up the bags after sitting in the room for an hour and exhausted after traveling for 21 hours we went downstairs where the guy who was suppose to deliver our bags said they never gave him the ticket we carried our own bags up to the room where once we pulled the sheets back on the bed saw that the mattress cover was entirely too small for the bed leaving a 6 inch gap on all sides and effectively making the bed one size smaller every single time i tried to order room service no one ever answered the phone eventually a recorded message only in french came on then hung up on us after the third time no one answered the room service line i rang the front desk and they said they would have room service call us back which they finally did 15 minutes later as we were about to leave to head out to find food elsewhere only about half of the nozzles in the rain shower head worked when we went to use the workout room we found worms in the two nectarines we tried to eat i know this one isn t the hotels fault per se but was indicative of our experience the room next to us had what i assume was a wakeup call every morning though no one ever answered their phone and it rang continuously other than the location i would not recommend this property ,0
 big beds each nice bathroom and added bonus of a fridge in the room and a superb breakfast,1
 lovely new hotel ideal for o2 arena everything 5 star prices of course,1
 broken sink doors and windows not closing properly in the first room taking full day to find another room beds mattresses could have used a replacement several years ago breakfast are very monotonous especially if staying for more than a few days ,0
 the staff were wonderful and the room was nice with a large bathroom the kettle and tea were nice ,1
 the hotel was dirty windows very smeared and streaked so could not see outside the bed was like sleeping on an ironing board and the pillow the same breakfast was truly disgusting mess everywhere in the dining hall salt and pepper missing out of virtually every cruet pot the self service area was a mess the scrambled egg was dry like rubber the porridge was caked 3 inches deep to the wall of the cooking pot the bacon was a blue grey colour the fried eggs were swimming in oil the sausages were deep fried to cremation the coffee smelled terrible cheap the staff had no care for their jobs with what appeared non existent staff motivation and the cook s clothing was badly stained and dirty yet he was allowed to come out to the dining area to replenish food supplies with even more sad looking food if i was assessing this my profession is in internal auditing establishment from a company perspective i would fail it on many levels where food and staff were concerned and would insist on a plan of action by the general manager to vastly improve immediately ,0
 good location and nice hotel,1
 staff prices facilities we were overcharged by booking com but the hotel would not make any adjustments they say it is booking com s fault but booking com say it is the hotel who give them the rates our room was for 3 persons but all facilities were for 2 cups glasses coffee tea etc if a question was raised with the staff an answer was never received despite promises to get an answer no courtesy in this hotel treated like a second rate citizen no parking despite booking it so had to stay in a multi story a short drive away my advice find another hotel there are plenty to choose from,0
 liften in panne waterlek in de kamer,0
 the danger of theft is enough to put anyone off i was really shocked by the standard of security at novotel considering it is a four star hotel we placed all our valuables in our luggage and locked it before we left our room there was a safe in the room but we thought that our measures were enough this is novotel and our luggage is locked plus the door should have been securely locked as well when we came back we found our luggage zip broken and all the items inside thrown out with all our cash inside stolen we immediately notified the manager at the reception who sent a technician up to check the card access records on our door both of them affirmed that burglaries are rather rare at the hotel and because of that they are inexperienced with dealing such things according to them there was nothing suspicious regarding the entry records and called for the police to handle the matter in fact when we met with the police the next day the officer in charge told us the exact opposite of what they said apparently it was not the first time this has happened at this particular hotel many times in fact and they are investigating the issue seriously right now after going through the access records we found out that there was another card which did not belong to us which was used to enter the room according to the police there was a request for replacing for a lost card when we were not even in the hotel at that time it is outrageous to think that anyone can waltz up to the reception and ask for a replacement card so easily we are currently still corresponding with the police regarding this issue the hotel staff was rather cavalier about the whole issue no one came the day after the burglary to speak to us about it nor did they offer any further help we had to go to them ourselves to remind them we need to check out later due to the investigation we are not pleased with the manner the hotel handled this situation ,0
 stayed one night room comfortable even if only a standard room very little noise of other occupants,1
 good location and friendly staff,1
 quick easy stay helpful staff,1
 i booked a superior room but it was so small that we had to climb over the bed to get to the window getting dressed had to be done by the door as it was impossible anywhere else spending any time in the room was claustrophobic i would not return and cannot recommend ,0
 the room given had a adjoining door so i could hear everything next door including very loud music and a lot of moaning and screaming fro 1 30am to 6 00pm of an intimate nature the occupants are entitled to that but my room wasn t fit for purpose i did complain about the former problem and eventually the music stopped the second problem i thought it futile on checking out very early and recounting this problem to the reception staff i was offered a coffee couldn t wait to leave to get some sleep at home ,0
 if you had a special request tha behavior of the people in the hotel is very rude,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet ,1
 bed bugs rude staff denied bed bugs said it was mosquito or spiders not close to a four star more like a inn ,0
 we had a beautiful room with a balcony that had a view of the eiffel tower we were very impressed with the d cor of the hotel which is quite charming the location was great just 4 blocks from notre dame ,1
 beautifully appointed rooms comfy beds great bars spa fabulous one of the best massages ive ever had ,1
 clean and centrally located,1
 bed uncomfortable and room small breakfast was cold and service non existent,0
 once you get past lobby all changes rooms are tiny beds are tiny ac not working on my room when it was below freezing outside they did change my room but initial response from personal was i ll bring you a heater ,0
 nothing unhelpful and rude staff the room was a disgrace it was filthy threadbare carpets cracked sink mold on the ceilings gaffa tape along the bottom of the shower screen bottom bit of the bathroom door missing aircon very noisy and didn t cool the room just pumped out dust squatting would have been more comfortable do not stay here ,0
 excellent staff clean quiet very good location,1
 the whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly the dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well the room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again ,1
 i was most disappointed with the hotel it is undergoing major refurbishment had we known we would not have booked we have stayed previously in a hotel that was undergoing a refurbishment we should have been told about this and been given the opportunity to book a different hotel and if the room was a deluxe double i m at a loss to see why the room was very small you had to edge sideways to get between the bed and the wall to get from the door to the hanging space for our clothes and as for the bathroom apologies for getting personal but you could not sit on the toilet properly as it was too close to the wall in front of you the corridor our room was in room 005 ground floor had been blocked off just passed it so the chambermaids trolley and the dirty washing was right outside of the door and it appeared that there was a smoking area in the street outside of the window as regularly workers were there smoking i cannot see how this warrants 4 status we would not stay again at this hotel,0
 no refund most bookings have this simple facility needed to change dates but no refund for days already booked will not be recommending to anyone and will not be using novotel again ,0
 the bed was uncomfortable big dip in the mattess sky didn t work was a let down really,0
 unfortunately room did not have toileteries ie toothbrush and paste requested newspaper which was left outside the room instead of having it slipped inside the room so had no idea it was there phoned to check if room was smoking room and felt staff was very offhand and rude room was okay although one of the upholstered chair was considerably stained did not want to sit on it ,0
 the location was good and even though the hotel was huge the reception felt friendly and accessible,1
 refer to comments regarding our stay from june 6 8 2017,1
 everything,1
 i arrived very late in the evening and had a very early start and the check in staff were extremely slow despite no other customer being around the floor was a no smoking floor but the whole floor and corridor stank of cigarette smoke the location is shocking kings cross i may as well call any wherein the m25 near kings cross this hotel is situated in a dodgy poorly lit area not that near to the station as a female sole traveller it felt very unsafe ,0
 the buffet breakfast was typical cheap tricks never refill the empty containers staff never bother to help serving coffee and tea ,0
 everything ,1
 claustrophobic room bed was dirty hair everywhere i slept with my clothes on on top of the blanket shampoo bottles in the shower were half empty did they even clean this in between guests ,0

 the room was so small ,0
 they took money from my card for extras on check in but then informed me there was no bar or restaurant i daren t ask what extras they were offering this place is shabby dingy and not worth the money avoid also bizarrely they asked if i wanted to pay in romanian currency ,0
 on arrival we found 2 long black hairs in the bedsheets elevator out of service and room in 4th floor we booked a quiet room and what we got was a room next to the elevator which was very loud and also the room themselves were not sound isolated we even could hear our neighbours talking the breakfast included turned out to be only for continental breakfast and they asked for extra payment if we want english breakfast it was overall very dirty and old for all this it is much too expensive we cannot recommend this hotel ,0
 junior suite is miss marketed the junior suite is smaller than most double rooms in most hotels,0

 everything else,0
 very comfortable bed really well designed bedroom with great views fantastic breakfast ,1
 bed was v small double room v small right next to lift shaft loud music next door at 4am outside knightsbridge is full of the rich boy racers hitting the streets in b loud cars all night seriously don t go to this hotel if you want any sleep whatsoever my wife had a discussion with the manager in he morning and she never complains about anything she was offered an upgrade next time i really don t think it would make any difference to quality of he stay i stay in a lot of hotels in london over a long period of time i think this has to the worst experience in terms of sleep quality ,0

 i was over charged for the parking as the clocks had gone back an hour and the parking machine wasn t updated therefore the exit time was showing an hour ahead i asked a member of staff for help who told me to pay the ticket 55 and then go to front desk and they will refund the extra hour that i was charged for when i got to the front desk the lady was very apologetic and could clearly see the mistake made she even made a phone call to her colleague to make sure the clocks were turned back on the machine so no other customers would have the same problem she then told me to wait a few minutes as she needed to get authorization to refund the extra hour however this other lady came out and said i was not allowed to have a refund for the extra hour as it was not the hotels policy to give refunds even the first lady was a bit shocked as to how we were spoken too i left feeling very disappointing as to what was a great weekend ,0
 close to paddington station,1
 restaurant closed for refurbishment constant noise from contractors drilling beds not made up on return late afternoon ,0
 very friendly and helpful staff the area is so quite the room was well air conditioning the location is not so far from the center,1

 the staff where rude from the moment we got there the staff where smoking in front of the reception outside the hotel when we arrived the check in the staff where rude when i ordered breakfast the coffe was cold and i scrambled eggs on toast came with no toast and was cold then they changed it for me and brought up some cold toast with no butter and hot coffe 20 mins later it was a mess then i used the spa where the receptionist was extremely rude and i had to pay 20 pounds cash to use the pool i had no id to give to receive a locker key in the end i was allowed one i was called back after leaving the hotel being accused of stealing a locker key which i was offended at the hotel staff don t speak english properly and have a very bad attitude i was disappointed we paid for a nicer room and was given a disabled room with a wet room bath room and no bath was very ugly ,0
 everything incompetent staff ridiculously small room for a big price there wasnt even space for our 2 bags miniature tv no fridge disgusting lobby scary elivators,0
 on first arrival our room smelt like people had been smoking there was also a big generator outside our room which woke us multiple times in the morning the view from my window was somebodies house and back garden our second night myself and my partner checked out of the hotel due to a big party happening at the hotel and all you could hear was the music which was shaking our room and lots of people shouting i spoke to reception and asked what time the party ended to which they replied about 23 30 midnight i said ok could you have not informed us of this prior to which he shrugged his shoulders and said your room is right above it he then said you look very tired aswell which i replied i am tired and also not feeling well after then arranging to stay at a family members we went to check out recepetion then said they could offer us another room which was one floor up however the hotel is small and the noise could still be heard they offered no compensation and i still had to pay for second nighy despite leaving at 20 30 i m not usually somebody to complain but this hotel is dreadful i wouldn t recommend to my worst enemy ,0
 as usual perfect,1
 not a friendly staff i was ask to buy two room because im coming with my 3 years old boy and 10 month baby the upgrade are not possible because family rooms are full then they ask to buy another room to split family with young children impossible no tolerance at all and the other room are almost double the booking price i end up paying 2 rooms for this stay the hotel not up to the standard just add few euro you can stay in pullman which just next to the hotel at pullman you can have view of eifel tower at mercure you will get view of pullman room service are slow ,0
 loved the high bed it was super comfy the hotel was one block from bayswater station starbucks mcdonalds and all the essentials ,1
 i have never stayed in this hotel before it was easy to get yourself lost in westminster borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till i have eventually have found the destination it made my life so much easier as i ve never been around in this part of london before when i walked in to the main entrance i was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room my club room was beautiful but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery it didn t fuss me much though the cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was enormous i had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of merlot never to late to drink on your arrival why not the best part of the hotel was the breakfast i didn t like the breakfast i absolutely loved it as it was the best breakfast ever everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts the restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home they were so lovely and i felt very accomplished to half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star well done to all and be prepared for my next visit xx,1
 lovely rooms friendly staff,1
 the location of the hotel is excellent you could reach london eye within a walking distance,1
 the location is excellent the staff were extremely accommodating and would do anything to help us the breakfast was very good i loved the view from our bedroom too the skyline bar at night is a must looking forward to coming back in march ,1
 room was tiny,0
 the maids didn t clean the room well each day leaving rubbish bins full and pillows or towels on the floor when we called room service twice we were told we had to go from the 7th floor to the first to collect our order ourselves we were told we were not allowed to have larger glasses for drinking water as they were for the bar but if we wanted to order room service i e coke or a cocktail they could provide the larger glass once leaving we requested a taxi be called we then got it the taxi outside the hotel only to have another taxi block us of and abuse our current driver to which hotel staff then joined the argument over the fare rather than resolving the issue the pillows and towels where also very small and the toilet very cramped and without and exhaust fan the air conditioning in the room also did not work well resulting in hot and smelly nights very dissatisfied customers we stayed for both business and leisure ,0
 it is never a 5 star property extremely disappointed room dark and depressing facilities non existent nobody eating in restaurant and few people in bar outdated shabby furniture and no atmosphere,0
 beds uncomfortable pillows too soft and room too small for a queens guest room,0

 air condition don t work was cold in the room the door key was broke three times bad area in the neighbourhood ,0
 for gbp 260 per night this hotel is totally out of step with its peers the decor is tired old fashioned and dated low quality bed linens pillows and duvet scratchy hard cottons and no feathered duvet just those thick cotton fillings that sit rigidly above your body and do not fall around you very loud rattling noise from the air conditioning unit and since the windows don t open no option but to keep it switched on so your choice therefore is to bake in a boiling hot room and not sleep or have the air con on and struggle to sleep above the noise breakfast is nothing to write home about and served in a rather dingy room though again the christmas decorations at least were nicely done it is winter and yet only 1 thin towel each provided in the bathroom and no bathrobes we were moved to a suite for our second night and yet sadly even in there the decor was terribly dull it was such a poor use of space as well a large living room with a sofa two armchairs coffee table and a cupboard in it simply no atmosphere at all for an extra gbp 100 a night we could have stayed somewhere like hazlitts or the w which is where we usually stay and stayed here only for ease of connection to victoria gatwick we will never stay here again ,0
 great location great facilties great rooms,1

 mattrass,0
 great location beautiful building,1
 the lobby was dark corridors inside hotel were dark and dingy rooms were too small and flooring was bare cement bathroom was small and wc was leaking for 2 days before it was set right over charged for breakfast 18 euro per person when most hotels charged 10 euro for an average fare with just fruit cereal toast some eggs did not allow us to delink breakfast from room rent when we wanted to stop b fast they provide 2 small bottles of water on day 1 and then onwards charge 5 euro per 1 2 litre bottle outrageous we bought a 2 litre bottle from carrefour for 22 cents furniture was made of iron and plain and noisy when moved just wanted to have the breakfast and get out of the hotel and return only at night totally fagged out to worry about the room indian hotels are far far far better in terms of rooms service and rates paris hotels suck for the price they charge ,0
 cleanness,0
 room was very pleasant clean modern well equipped ,1
 rooms was cold windows felt paper thin complained 3 times and got s fire and and extra blankets each time instead of asking to to be moved rooms no great response from reception ,0
 after emailing the hotel with a pretty big request of preparing the room romantically for valentine s day using stuff that i had ordered to the hotel they set it up exactly as described in my email which was very specific as to where things should go and on top of this lina left a card wishing us happy vday and some chocolates the small touches made a big difference and i also thought the staff were so friendly value for money ,1
 very smart room good food ,1
 like the fact you had smoking rooms,1
 room was in a separate building across the street from the main hotel so not really any facilities unless you go to main hotel first single room in the basement smelled terrible due to sewer issues next door staff upgraded me to a double room ground floor which is nice of course but also pretty normal in these circumstances bed linens where dirty brown stain and bloodstains and have to be changed even for a double room pretty small though but as i was alone i don t care about it staff was really nice and helpful but won t book it again ,0
 the decor throughout is very dated and tired in parts of the communal areas the carpet was thread bare and had been repaired with duck tape our room was particularly shabby definitely not a 4 star hotel ,0
 room was very clean comfortable although a little on the small side the only negative would be that the outside was off putting with scaffolding close to all the shops and travel stations would stay again ,1
 staff were rude and extremely unaccommodating booked two double rooms through booking com when we arrived my in laws were put in an executive double room seconds after me and my partner were put in a standard twin despite both rooms being booked as doubles when questioned we were told we had been put in a twin because they were full we booked in may and there were masses of people still arriving never mind the fact our parents had been booked into their executive room after us i made the booking and paid for both rooms myself when i pointed out the backwards nature of what had happened with our rooms staff couldn t justify it kept changing their story as to why it had happened and essentially told us it was tough this was at 4pm on arrival throughout discussions with various member of staff i was spoken to like a second class citizen after pushing the issue speaking to staff three times in total i was assured that we would be moved by the time we returned from our night out this didn t happen and we were stuck with our room when we returned at midnight our whole experience of this hotel was negative also towels were dirty and the shower flooded the floor but that s really beside the point rang the hotel s customer service line the day after over three weeks ago now and still haven t had a response to my complaint will not be using them again completely ruined my boyfriend s birthday weekend away and i was left in tears due to my anger at the outcome and the way i was treated by staff ,0
 friendly staff easy to get to easy to walk to the bus ,1
 room was lovely we got a free upgrade bathroom fab excellent breakfast nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice ,1

 great location and such a beautiful interior the historic connection added to the glamour too fabulous restaurants nearby and excellent transport links ,1
 the room the decor the price the bar there was a green fire exit light on in the room all night that was so bright i couldnt sleep if there was a fire i would have been too tired to get out of bed and therefore died ,0
 had no windows in room they were going to give us so had to swap to a twin room was extremely dated shower head wouldnt stay in position due to being loose dirty carpet dirt up the walls by the bin wallpaper coming off wall in a number of places staff at bar were rude stayed in much nicer hotels for half the price ,0
 the room,0
 got charged twice,0
 staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the day and night very close to the london eye ,1
 great breakfast buffet a bit of everything bercy village is a cute little neighborhood with a great variety of restaurants to chose from and very easy to hop on metro to get to all the sites ,1
 the slippers the tea coffee making facilities the cushion in the bath tub were very very welcome and a true plus very quiet and well located ,1
 the staff was slow and not very helpful at checkin and first insisted we had a reservation for a single room only eventually they admitted we had booked a double but the room and the bed were so tiny it might as well have been a single the room was way too hot and the thermostat did not work properly there was a very long corridor with many steps to the room which made it rather difficult with heavy luggage ,0
 the location is horrible and really dirty area the hotel is awkward and uncomfortable the bathrooms are a joke so small your knees hit the sink when using the toilet horrible awkward rooms i believe we would have enjoyed london a lot more had we chosen another hotel ,0
 surprisingly big room stylish loved the bath room especially that there was a shower instead of a tub friendly and helpful staff,1
 i loved the hotel and the location the staff were very friendly the food was fab and our room was excellent ,1
 well maintained hotel first visited when first opened a few years ago standard has been maintained,1
 dear sir madam i am wondering if this was a hotel i couldn t even categorise it to a 4 star hotel the whole time it smelled bad the pictures in web site didn t match with the reality here seems to be a guest house rather than a hotel the rooms were not spacious enough so that it was hard to move ,0
 excellent room and interesting hotel great location out of the centre but easy to get to on tram ,1
 very comfortable bed and pillows and an excellent en suite shower ,1
 for a hotel of this standard i was shocked at the quality of tissue paper provided some of the reception staff seemed a little confused about doing their job ,0
 if you are claustrophobic do not stay in this hotel room no 504 is just big enough for a queen sized bed had to pay extra to upgrade to a suite and only then did i get a normal my elbows could touch the celing room for the price of a suite terrible entrance lobby for a 4 star hotel breakfast in a dungeon of a basement had to ask for stuff in a buffet pay extra look for a better location i m not so pedantic normally but damn ,0
 the noise at night music being played by a private function the room was just below my room until 1am complained numerous times no action taken by management said it would stop at 1,0
 staff attitude is not professional at all specially the check in reception i booked a specific type of room and they gave me different thing not family friendly at all as there are no interconnecting room which is not mentioned anywhere when i searched about it extremelly overpriced,0
 staff manners,0
 reception staff were not very accommodating,0
 the room was immaculate the cleaners obviously take their work very seriously which is nice ,1
 room was loud because of traffic noise the furniture carpeting etc were not in good condition,0
 the room was not nice for the price will not stay again ,0
 the staff was amazing meeting all of our needs and more locating a sitter for my boys providing games water for our walks and scooters in the park they were fabulous the location is perfect right across from kensington gardens ,1
 entrance was filthy covered in cigarette butts cigarette disposals were broken and hadn t been cleaned in a long time check in was difficult as and all reception interaction as english was not the first language of reception staff leading to a misunderstanding with staff on payment no one available to help with bags and no trolley immediately available homeless beggars always hanging around the entrance to the hotel the tvs in the room were flatish but square square haven t seen one since the mid 90s furniture in hotel was falling apart holes in the arms of chairs in public spaces ac was only turned on after asking reception despite heat wave all pillows were mismatched this is not the hotel it appears do not pay more than 100 pounds a night,0
 convenient to kings cross station a good stop over when using the eurostar train service a 63 bus stops just outside the hotel and delivers you the main entrance of the station,1
 beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms staff a very helpful and chatty it s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer,1

 got into a dirty bed full of stale breadcrumbs and fingernail clippings at 10 30 at night they moved the room straight away and the receptionist saw it and was really embarrassed when spoke to the management the next day they weren t bothered at all and said they d look into it and call back but nothing they could do they never called back really poor service and completely inexperienced and such a shame given what a great location this is ,0
 beautifully decorated room which was also immaculately clean the bed was gorgeous to sleep in don t think i ve slept in much better,1
 the hotel is clean and well located between both temple and chancery lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them the room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need the bed is more for the very soft kind i personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard staff is efficient and very kind ,1
 given the high room prices for this hotel i would have expected a lot more ,0
 great location friendly competent staff ,1
 awesome historic building conveniently located next to the underground staff specifically miles was incredibly friendly and made our stay an experience ,1
 no hot water for 2 days in the whole hotel,0

 even the basic ammenaties were not available that you would be used to in regular hotel rooms this was more like a shoe string budget hotel at a expensive london price ideally they should be charging 40 per night ,0
 they kept be waiting for four hours to check in even though i informed them of my arrival time more than 72 hrs before i asked for a wake up call the day i was traveling and they never called except calling to blame me for keeping the driver waiting for me and my family for more than ten minutes and their is no house keeping after 7pm or room service,0

 everything i have logged a complaint with the management of hotel and i have requested a refund as i did not get what i had paid for at the same time as logging my complaint another guest had found a dead rat in there room so all in all this hotel was pretty shocking compared to what have previously stayed in ,0

 hotel staff location and breakfast all fantastic thank you park plaza for a wonderful stay i m very fussy when staying in hotels and this hotel didn t let me down on anything really quiet in the bedroom and a wide range of different clients who all apprared comfortable will definitely use this hotel again ,1
 the bathroom was tiny and just didn t work water everywhere after a shower three times i told the front desk the plug wouldn t dislodge from the sink rendering further use impossible they unstuck it each time but then the next time it was used it would do it again felt they just smiled and nodded without really trying to sort it out very small bedroom also for 2 people ,0

 for a 4 stars hotel you d expect more than what they had to offer no bell boy for the luggage it is a building where u had to get to the 1st floor for reception so dont expect a lobby elevator is so tiny it barley fits 3 people we had many bags and they wouldnt fit in the elevator room key card keeps jamming and he elevator wont start without it there is actually an issue with the elevator as when u press your floor it taked you back down or i stays in its place even when u insert your room key housekeeping dont answer the phone you should try calling many times until u gey lucky reception dont answer the phone you should try many times wifi was horrible it kept disconnecting and when u r connected it is unbelievably slow informed the reception about it and they said the tech team was not available bathroom was very very tiny bath towels were not clean at check in one had hair and lipstick on it room carpet old and unclean no refregerator scratched up furnature the sink in the bathroom was jammed the water kept floating the house keeping make the bed only and clean the toilet the trash can in the bed room stayed the same the sink in the bathroom kept floding the water would not drain ,0

 the bar is beautiful and the service there was great ,1
 nicest bed i ve slept in in paris in a long time also very quiet even though it was on a busy street,1
 1 the property did not even have the air conditioner working 2 it is right next to the railway track so cant open windows as it is very loud throughout the night 3 the hotel was under renovation and it looked like a complete construction site and not a hotel ,0
 the room had no view other than an internal atrium and made the room very dark the air conditioning in the room also didn t work very well having spoken to reception about moving etc they said they couldn t offer any other rooms even though it wasn t full they really couldn t have given a monkeys at checkout when i complained they were again ambivalent shan t be staying there again ,0

 everything looks old and is old tiny lift and narrow corridors stained carpet stained ceiling ruined woodwork leaking shower head no ventilation in the bathroom broken ,0
 great value for money,1
 3 attempts at getting a room with a bath as requested,0
 everything especially service and treatment and lack of flexibility,0
 i booked a double bed room and ended up with two single beds which also had a dead fly on the bed upon arrival bed sheets were quite hard on the skin which isn t the best for someone who has eczema ,0
 the service at the hotel was terrible it was my partners birthday and had arranged the romance package along with my own champagne on ice the romance package was just rose petals on the bed and nothing else they promised for his birthday there was the smallest chocolate thing which wasn t even worth sending up the shower was never a constant temperature it kept going hot and cold we ordered room service twice for drinks as it was a hot day and we had to call up twice to check where the drinks were and to ask for ice and glasses as they only sent bottles would not stay here again ,0
 tasty cooked breakfast,1
 room on ground floor very noisy no lift terrible for people living on the first and second floors,0
 the size of the room was very big,1
 lovely decor friendly staff good location but it is about a 10 minute walk to a tube station brilliant facilities large bath and walk in shower ,1
 the staff kindly let me and my family have a 3 00 departure which was appreciated the hotel bedroom was very quiet which was wonderful the night porter mark was charming ,1
 the rooms were lovely and the beds were really comfy,1
 excellent helpful staff great location comfortable room,1
 absolutely exquisite hotel and incredible location beautiful view elegant decor exceptional staff ,1
 the hotel was in a fantastic location for the train station and the apollo theatre we both enjoyed our stay very much abd just wished we could have stayed longer,1
 hotel in good location beautiful building staff excellent beautiful bedding and towels breakfast plentiful would definitely use it again ,1
 the hotel was rather expensive and breakfast was not included in the price they said afterwards that the breakfast costs 18 euros per person there was an extra charge for the city tax although it claimed to be 4 star it did not have facilities like sauna or gym the safety box was very small and you cannot put your laptop in it ,0
 for starters the reception staff do not speak english in london noisy rooms from the lift all night tvs that don t work and beds and pillows from henry s days don t expect much from this place and you won t be disappointed ,0
 located mins to the 02 arena excellent staff were friendly and some staff were helpful room was clean the view was lovely from the hotel window ,1
 staff were very friendly prompt check in good turn down service etc good location close to river and covent garden our room was spacious clean and very quiet nice touches in the room like free champagne for our anniversary reception responded promptly to all my emails prior to arrival,1
 people smoking on the steps outside no help with luggage ,0
 room was fantastic,1
 there was a constant beeping outside my door because of the broken elevator i had to walk down 6 flights of stairs 3 times through the night and complain it was impossible to fall asleep the room smelled of urine and the breakfast that i paid 15 pounds for was inedible,0
 rooms furniture shows it s age rooms are dirty some stuff stuck on the table and has never been cleaned dirty pillows plenty blonde long hair in room not ours hotel entrance into west wing shabby and always smells like going into public swimming pool people put their dirty room service orders back on the floor and not being cleaned up for hours hours strange people walking almost naked across floors scary service personnel didn t live up to even 4 star standards restaurant reserved table was given away wrong orders being brought to table pool water very cold sauna benches were soaked with water can just someone tell the guest to use towels in the sauna could continue but likely worst 5 star hotel we ve ever been,0
 great staff and complimentary upgrade breakfast was amazing ,1
 the rooms were extremely small 2 people and 2 suitcases are enough in order to stop moving inside the cleanness was terrible i had a mouth bleeding problem and they left the pillowcases 3 times in blood because their policy is to change them every 2 days wifi free no way and all those amazing services for only 300 per night,0
 good size room with good layout for everything like cupboard ironing board small fridge sitting area with good size sofa and writing desk washroom with bath tub was good too at check in it was quite busy but staff was very active professional and courteous my special thanks to rafealea ,1
 dirty toilet and poor enterior need a renovation no good staff it the front desk ,0
 looks like it was decorated in 1984 expensive breakfast long winded check in 0300h in the morning messy expensive carpark no mini bar expensive,0
 the beds were so comfortable could have slept forever i didn t want to move ,1
 i was extremely disappointed with the whole experience room was not ready breakfast was poor and the standard of the hotel was dated and smelt musty,0
 we were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working the alternate hotel is advertised as 4 star i don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other 4 star rated hotels i have stayed in it does not meet the high standard expected of a 4 star the bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average it was a real disappointment ,0
 the fact that there was no minibar unforgivable ,0
 dirty room and tired room outlook was insulation of some kind awful ,0
 i booked this hotel 2 months before my arrival i saw that there is an option to bring one child under 16 years old with no extra cost the option is still mentioned on booking website i mentioned on the invitation that we are a family of 5 since we booked a room for 4 and i would like to use the option to have 3 kids using the existing bed set exactly what is mentioned on the hotel page on booking com we arrived on 2am in the morning and the staff was not willing to give me a key unless i will pay for 1 extra room double cost i told them that the 2 kids are sleeping and they asked them to give me at least the key for the first room that i ve already paid just to send them to sleep and we can continue the conversation but they said no way and there is a clear message from the manager that i need to pay for extra room before i can use the first room i felt like a hostage and at the end i gave them my credit card just to be able to send my kids to sleep the staff also mentioned that they told booking that i cannot get a room and booking told them that it s ok but no one informed me they both forgot the customer till now neither the hotel or booking provided me the name or time that they informed me about that i m still shocked from the bad service that i got from both the staff and manager that didn t have me any solution and just want my money on top of all that they room was prepaid and they didn t gave me any option for refund super bad service which made the overall experience bad ,0
 the staff were really helpful and the hotel was in a great location ,1
 nice size room good breakfast,1
 noisy room very small room sounded like having a washing machine on top of my head won t return ,0
 for price room was small especially bathroom breakfast was poor will not stay here again ,0
 drilling noise right above the bedroom at 8am the size of the room was not what i booked the refurb room upgrade was an insult and just smelt strongly of paint not worth the money at all much rather a premier inn,0
 rude staff poor menu in restaurants and very un accomodating people,0
 the food was disgusting and came to the table with foreign objects included personal to whoever cooked it which put everyone off their food staff did not understand english which made communication very difficult ordering a taxi took 20 minutes to convince reception that we did not want to go to the airport we want to go to the theater overall very bad experience will never stay there again ,0
 rooms uncomfortably hot breakfast poor ,0
 excellent neighborhood with interesting restaurants ,1
 surly and incompetent staff phone did not work and was never repaired,0
 comfy and spacious room and staff were helpful,1
 didn t do breakfast as 4 of us at 25 each was expensive,1
 the whole place is under renovation it should not offer services to public lifts not working guest have to climb stairs to their rooms ,0
 i tried to call the reception to get me tooth brushes and tooth paste but the receptions kept cut me off so we couldn t even brush our teeth the products inside the bathroom were missing as well as sleepers and that wasn t good enough service for the price we payed ,0
 the staff was really helpful ,1
 leak in bathroom while taking a shower as a result carpet in the entrance of the room was completely wet ,0
 the room was an overpriced shoebox no storage no room at the side of the bed tiny room ,0
 arrived in the middle of the night and hotel told me sorry overbooking no room left it took an hour until they organized a new one which was horrible tiny room without any proper window ,0
 most of it staff were rude bathroom was dirty and fixture were dangerous,0
 desperately needs a refurbishment way dated and over priced downright dreadful hotel ,0
 cleanliness pleasant staff and location to subway and london sights ,1
 room offered in a poorly unready state with used towels everywhere we have been relocated 3 times during stay without apology bed sheets feel dirty with yellow stains staff barely speaks and understands english ,0
 1 it is really convenient to get on the paddington express from heathrow walk down to the hotel it is just under 10mins 2 it s in a peaceful street with very friendly efficient staff quick to meet our requests 3 lots of shops restaurants close by so convenient 4 comfortable bed pillows fluffy quilts very clean free wi fi 5 the bikkies everyday are a nice touch though if they had provided botlled water that too would have been good not so expensive for them ,1
 i love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street the breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious the rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you the whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive west end hotel but with a cosy feel to it it s my favourite hotel in london and i ve stayed in quite a few ,1
 big spacious comfortable room no city noise and nice little extra touches,1
 the room is too small and some of the rooms are too complicated to find ,0
 the staff were wonderful and very attentive beautiful decor and excellent location ,1
 no services for the room or for the resident the fridge was empty there is no hala foods for muslims etc,0
 comfy bed,1
 the bed was a standard double not as pictured on booking com certainly not extra large the bath was also not as pictured the spa package i booked was not written down and was unavailable the spa staff were unaware a promotion was even on the small pool at the spa was so tiny and dirty that it had jets to swim against which would have been great but they didn t work people were playing loud music and video chatting on their phones in the spa but when i mentioned this to staff i was told they don t have a no phone policy the masseur was nowhere near qualified or skilled enough for the price charged ok for a college graduate freebie massage but i was pleased when it was over which was less than the hour i had paid for wish i d asked for a discount in the spa for poor massage and broken facilities we ended up leaving early and didn t go back the next morning ,0
 the room was tiny and shabby marks on the walls and dated decor very dusty also water not replaced for second night of stay very expensive with breakfast not even included internet kept dropping constantly with need to keep entering password ,0
 super friendly staff members small extras like candy that make the stay even nicer ,1
 i loved the view from the balcony it was amazing,1
 after spending a considerable amount of money at this hotel we checked out and were waiting for our driver to heathrow that we arranged via the hotel concierge service we bought starbucks coffee for the long car ride a hotel staff member rudely told us we couldn t have outside drinks and wanted us to have it outside my traveling companion was my 80 year old grandmother and i am pregnant there is no signs in the lobby saying you can t drink outside beverages i will never go back again the worst customer service ever ,0
 1 breakfast dishes are simply dirty 2 room cleaning is unacceptable and even dirty cups have been left on a table 3 absolutely no help with a meeting at the door and a luggage 4 bath is simply dirty and unkept 5 staff is neither polite nor proactive,0
 lovely bathroom great bath nice room layout good room a luxury for london proximity to travel options space in hotel great bed ,1
 friendly welcome excellent accommodation and good location ,1
 location and room,1
 amazing hotel and location fantasics rooms and plenty of space staff very helpful,1
 location and staff,1
 courtney on reception was a great guy and happy to go that extra mile to be helpful ,1
 i believe there were rats behind the plasterboard going on the noise they were making ,0
 absolutely great hotel comfy rooms clean great staff great location ,1
 value for money was hard to find this was supposed to be a 4 star hotel yet we had a cosy room with a double bed which was actually two singles pushed together the shower leaked onto the shower room floor the shelf in the shower was hanging off the room was not properly insulated for sound and you could hear banging pipes and people walking around all night the aircon did not work and the bed linen was dirty 500 for three nights in april was way off the mark ,0
 unhelpful staff wanted to charge me 40 to extend my check out time by an hour unwelcoming receptionists with very poor english dark corridors even darker stuffy rooms and no way of opening any windows so stuck with ac no tube close by so everywhere had to get taxis best bit was the comfy bed and 50 deal off all meals in restaurant in evening hotel was a real let down ,0
 location,1
 the hotel was very old fashion it could do with a little revamp the bar had no atmosphere what s so ever me and my partner wanted a drink saturday night after coming back from a show it was only 10 30pm and there was no music on nor ever just a little sound in the back ground so we took our drinks to the room as it wasn t nice to be in bar the parking was very expensive on top off what your already paying most hotel are free or just a little charge this was 60 for 2 days overall very unhappy with our stay definitely won t be going to any of them hotel again ,0
 night shift staff,0
 unhappy with first room got moved as soon as a room was available,1
 very nice and comfortable hotel with paris spirit park view is excellent sun in the morning looking into windows is beautiful ,1
 we actually didnt stay here they had a problem with hot water they transferred us over to montcalm next to liverpool st station with free brekkie and taxi over the original place did look brilliant from what i seen though,1
 fantastic room lovely staff and brilliant location ,1
 overall location was fine however the bed was like a marshmallow far too soft public areas small concierge not very helpful nor friendly ,0
 room definitely not like pictures completely misrepresented website showed nice balcony had juliet balcony also misrepresentative 1 curtain was hanging light didn t work tv didn t work fridge didn t work etc etc etc etc had a kid one bed suite with a normal size bed come on who puts a normal size bed in a suite due to small bed and snoring i had to sleep on sofa left a day early couldn t take it,0
 everything was bad was given wrong room on arrival carpet dirty bed dirty hairs in bed hairs in towels everything smelled awful bed the most uncomfortable ever like sleeping on rocks noises coming from everywhere including a 3am bang on my door whole place in desperate need of refurb even then i wouldn t go back purely based on this experience and the fact that my email of complaint has still not been answered almost 1 week later ,0
 location staff friendly ,1
 there s no ventilation in the rooms as windows are sealed shut because the rooms are so warm you have to use the air con in the middle of winter the customer service staff are useless and frankly i don t know what their purpose is never again will i stay in a hilton hotel and your ratings are totally false ,0
 the front desk staff was not friendly at all booked a double room the room was too small even to fit a double bed the bed was pushed to the wall no lamp table nothing to place your alarm of any kind or socket to charge your mobile basically was pushed to the cold wall and had to jump off the bed from the other side not convenient at all the airconditioning was terrible and noisy when i complained to the frontdesk he basically told me this is a machine and it is like that i had to call house keeping three times to service the room as when i returned to the room mid day it was untouched although the sign was already on the door ,0
 very well located with nice neighborhood and it s quite a bargain with the discount ,1
 main reason close to paddington for heathrow express and pleasant walk through hyde park into mayfair and west end ,1
 it holds party at weekends the wall is so bad to isolate the room from the noise so it is like party just right beside you it is very noisy it is useless to complain because all staffs can do is to say sorry party stops at 12 o clock at night ,0
 i brought my mum and dad away and paid for 2 family rooms hoping they d be beside each other they were on different floors it was badly marked on how to get to each room my parents view was a generator that made a drilling noise across the ceiling all night and they had a bad sleep we called a member of staff up to hear how bad the noise was he said he d make a note of it our room was v cramped you can t open the bathroom door fully because it bangs off the bed ,0
 the staff were very helpful and friendly,1
 this was not a 4 hotel as advertised although clean the rooms were a joke 120 to stay in a very cramped dated not centrally heated room is ridiculous furniture is strained and battered plug sockets are un useable being located so low to counter tops not leaving enough space for cables we had to unplug our only heater to charge phones leaving the room freezing i would give this hotel a 2 5 star max and wouldnt pay more than 50 per night ,0
 everything,0
 staff helpfulness,1
 the beds were very nice and comfortable the staff were great the bathroom was great with a good powerful shower the room was nice and with plenty of space to move around the suitcases were brought up to the room for us and the car was valet parked you can easily walk to the o2 but at the moment it is a noisy walk because of the building work ,1
 room was small and dark not comfortable,0
 position of the hotel wifi and breakfast,1
 renovation work is just too noisy,0
 location is great wi fi connection is great ,1
 hotel was excellent travelled for my birthday had a cake and bottle of wine in the room staff were brilliant stay in ph hotels a lot because they are brilliant hotels,1
 the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean and comfy and a extra treat as they upgraded us for birthday,1
 please booking personal must be check all things then presents they in to booking web sit ,0
 i v booked the hotel via booking com but the reception couldn t find my reservation in the end they offered us a room i ve asked for deluxe exactly like the one i ve booked but unfortunately our expectations haven t been met it was a standard room for the price of a deluxe one small bed walk in shower no tv i am very disappointed as i ve stayed here before and i was really pleased with the room and services but never again at rafayel i m afraid ,0
 i found the hotel extremely overpriced very dated and shabby a premier inn is far better value for money hotel entrance is not wheelchair accessible very disappointing for a novotel ,0
 they were extremely inflexible with any request also very poor choice of breakfast ,0
 good location ,1
 how on earth is this 4 star powerpoint presentations for reception screen updates signage stuck on reception with cellotape unbranded tea and coffee in bedrooms toilet roll you used to get at school torn bedroom carpets dated and old ,0
 location was perfect loved the oj kitkat and water just right staff were lovely great staff overall,1
 location,1
 room smells other room was not cleaned staff not very friendly especially in restaurant,0
 great location comfortable rooms excellent counter staff specially jasmine,1
 from the moment you exit the elevator to your room floor you know you have made a mistake paying 400 a night for this hotel gloomy and dirty aisles outdated rooms with outdated furniture ,0
 noisy road,0
 the room was very small and had not been properly cleaned the fittings were all old and scratched the room was far too hot and the aircon didn t work ,0
 fact they were trying to make myself my partner and 3 year old daughter share a room after i had clearly booked for 2 adults and 1 child they were very reluctant to give us another room but did in the end a room next to a building site that started at 8am fair enough but right next to a crane that made a lound noise all night with the wind worse than a dripping tap and our sink kept blocking up ,0
 location is great easy walking access to all the sights the rooms are also spacious and comfortable ,1
 felt like a budget part of the hotel west wing in need of tlc two check in staff were unhelpful and snooty maybe because we had young children or level of room we had but for 300 a night this was by no way cheap without breakfast ,0
 wifi connection too slow for my teenager the tv firstly didnt work at all then when they fixed a fuse it stuck on the doubletree advert wouldn t show programmes very limited channels available if it had worked i had a broken plug socket one of the white sheets on my bed had black marks on it my teenager was disappointed there weren t even soft drinks in the fridge which was smelly never mind a mini bar we ordered salmon good pizza but it was chicago town that you buy at the supermarket not chef made there wasnt even 1 full roll of toilet paper in our bathroom there was hair in the sink not impressed in the least breakfast was ordered in room it didn t come with juice only one cereal bowl for 2 people and no toast never going back ,0
 the receptionist was extremely helpful but other than that the hotel is more like a 2 star the supposedly superior room was very cramped carpet stained and floorboards creaked non stop the curtains didn t close properly and the view looked onto someone s bedroom the television did not work and as my room adjoined reception i could hear music and people coming and going i returned to the hotel in the evening and there were several make guests drinking outside this gave the impression of a dss halfway house certainly for a lone female guest not at all reassuring about safety breakfast food was cold and generally school dinner like a woeful experience,0
 this hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location my spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park the breakfast selection was spectacular all considered this was a great hotel for the price and i plan to return ,1
 size and cleanliness of room general state of repair cooked breakfast awful ,0
 the staff was not helpful at all the room was extremely dated and the air conditioning was very lacking i had to call the front desk 3 times for 3 hours to get a fan brought up the location is very out of the heart of the city ,0
 the hotel needs to be refurbished poor hygiene ,0
 the room although an upgrade was very dated the bathroom smelt of bad drains i had to ask four times for earl grey tea bags in the room as it did say tea coffee making facilities but i don t drink green tea or english breakfast tea ,0
 the room was too hot problem in their ac staff does not bother when complained they told us to open the windows and sleep felt it a bit weird,0
 the room had an insect infestation it was extremely dusty and not very clean i certainly do not agree with the star ranking of this hotel my room was changed the next day as the manager was not available on the first day i did not get any apology and the cleaning unit did not attend the breakfast was certainly not vegetarian friendly the sausages are placed next to egg and other options and hotel visitors mix the utensils when serving themselves the staff had real difficulties in understanding my issues and never picked up the phone ,0
 this was the worst user experience i have ever experienced at a hotel even after we reported the problems to the management,0
 nice rooms helpful staff nice breakfast,1
 room was very clean location,1
 bed was very comfortable and air conditioning and shower worked great,1
 friendly staff free breakfast metro station nearby,1
 completely incorrectly described on booking com there are no dining facilities with the exception of breakfast american there is no bar and the rooms are very small the area will be unsuitable for certain types of guests,0
 the receptionist staff were very helpful also the breakfast staff ,1
 paying to park at hotel that paid stay at email from hotel telling me i could not eat there spa did not come as package no massage included no jacuzzi,0
 the front desk was really unacceptable which they proved us our room at 5 pm and we arrived at 3 00 front dest are not helpful,0
 cleanliness of the rooms room size is small to get a drink in the bar takes ages and everything is reserved for outside hotel guests maybe good the hotel needs to rethink their priorities on who their customers are the locals getting a drink or two or the guest staying at the hotel and that pay 2000 pounds for their stay if you want to experience customer first check in the shangri la hotel at the shard ,0
 all ok,1
 the old fashioned building not been spoiled,1
 every thing was excellent,1
 the building is very old for that amount of money is not worth it they should change the furniture it is very old not enough space to put stuff around the picture that show on the web is totally different the wooden floor is making so much noise when walking because they are old and loose overall the staff is nice but the place is old,0
 paid internet kept disconnecting and the hotel asked me to call the internet provider instead of them performing their job hotel was noisy and not comfortable beds very short covers sheets very expensive for their room rates there is no complimentary drinking water at all in the hotel high rates for upgrading for any thing ,0
 the staff and in particular louanne were utterly accommodating in every way we were there to celebrate both a special birthday and anniversary and we were treated like royalty the little extras included a bottle of wine and basket of fruit and free upgrade lovely touches which were greatly appreciated ,1
 very friendly staff,1
 felt spoilt and well looked after comfortable happy stay someone available all day and night lovely staff breakfast in bed luxury hotel ,1
 very slow check in check out free wifi was very patchy and was limited to 0 5mbs room was tatty window frame was rotten through and wouldn t shut so there was a constant draft the piping in my room had been repaired with duck tape the grout was very mouldy and there were stains on the carpet ,0
 rooms decoration,0
 room was a good size and decor was nice ,1
 this hotel is situated in an red light area the staff were unpleasant as well,0
 room facilities for 3 people a fold up bed not acceptable ,0
 amazing location comfy and staff amazing,1
 beautiful building antique styling exceptional staff helpful and professional ,1
 poor attitude with counter staff and management,0
 we had a triple room and it was very comfortable sleeping for three people good storage in the room for odds and ends the bathroom was actually quite large for europe and was very modern the shower was exceptional lots of hot water and great water pressure nice room with wood beams in the ceiling and a view of the street in front of the sorbonne the location was excellent on a pedestrian square with restaurants and access to lots of shopping and other restaurants with a short walk ,1
 this shouldn t be listed with parking it s non existent and is street parking on a meter if you can find a place where do i start the entrance was locked forcing us to enter with luggage through a busy bar the receptionist was unhelpful and didn t mention wifi or breakfast the lift is filthy dirty black with grime the room was blazing hot the windows didn t open properly they are sash and slam down when opened the wifi doesn t reach the room the room itself how this property ever got a 4 rating is totally beyond me more like non star rated the room is much more basic than anything i ve ever stayed in the shower controls are fiddly un user friendly and it was hopeless trying to get a decent temperature the shower head is not detachable and fixed miles above head height so the useless spray is even more useless because you can t detach it and bring it closer the free bath gel dispenser was broken breakfast poor selection not a coffee machine only old coffee being kept hot in jugs the morning receptionist was pleasant compared to the night staff never again,0
 staff fantastic and polite it was my boyfriends 21st they gave him a balloon gorgeous setting,1
 we were very disappointed by a policy that was not evident to us upon booking the room six months ahead of time the rate on an individual night varies by as much as 20 to 50 pounds per night dependent solely on the discretion of the hotel itself it was explained to me by reception that it varies solely on how busy they are not on the rate that i thought was locked in upon reserving a room i would not book here again simply because of a lack of transparency ,0
 location and gym,0
 mr farooq is a big helper ,1
 cleanliness really bad wifi didn t work rooms very small and no heating so the room was extremely cold,0
 the hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful the room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms i have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space i found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay at checkout time the staff were politely informed that i could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst i went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from london which was most appreciated overall i had an enjoyable stay at the grand royale london park hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to london ,1
 great central location super polite staff ,1
 excellent location very friendly and helpful staff,1
 mostly the very very bad customer service,0
 very old and not well maintained hotel,0
 very good service from start to finish great location,1
 location general areas,1
 the room was way too small located in the basement so you are basically trapped in a box without a window probably below the kitchen since my room was not at all soundproof every day i woke up around 6 00 am with people kitchen workers staff slamming the anti fire doors every 15 seconds and dragging some tables desks chairs upstairs every single day i didn t sleep well in any of my 4 nights there when they finally would go a bit more quiet than i could listen to guests coming and going also the double bed barely fit me and my wife ,0
 the wifi was over 20 pounds a day what a rip off when nearly every hotel now offers this for free the wahaca restaurant is downstairs in the same street and it s free wifi can be reached from many rooms the decor is dated but very high quality so it s a bit like being in a bond movie from the 70 s the corridors to the rooms stink of dust they need a good airing deep clean however the room itself was very clean and fresh ,0
 the receptionist was rude on arrival the housekeeper walked into my room without knocking when i complained the receptionist put the phone in my face i was offered a complimentary meal the chef obviously didn t understand the meaning of rare steak and did not check the salad as there was blue paper in it the best thing in the hotel was the waitress very professional ,0
 good location friendly staff,1
 the staff were super friendly and helpful ,1
 the staff was very warm and happy to help,1
 the hotel is in a great location with close proximity to waterloo station it was very easy to get to the hotel from heathrow airport via the heathrow express and bakerloo line from paddington station the staff was very friendly and helpful for a hotel room in europe the double suite was a good size for a family of four we also had a great view of the london eye from the 5th floor the children loved their coloring packets and were excited to use their park plaza euros at the bar i would highly recommend this hotel ,1
 excellent location very nice staff fair price ,1
 my overall experience was very positive enjoyed the stay ,1
 every thing else,0
 very clean comfortable rooms good quality breakfast great location ,1
 such a warm welcome when we entered very convenient in terms of visiting the o2 breakfast was perfect 100 best hotel i ve been to for breakfast selection was amazing classic cooked continental fruits yogurts smoothies my partner doesn t eat pork and there was vegi options in terms for the breakfast and alternative meats in the sausages staff went above and beyond in there service spa facilities were amazing and was a lot to do on sight so not much need to leave hotel 5 service 100 recommend and i ll be back again ,1
 the overall experience,1
 friendly stuff,1
 overpriced no good value for money ,0
 very narrow and dark corridors uncomfortable bath no kettle tea or coffee in the room no drinking water outside the minibar price performance is terrible ,0
 i didnt get the room i wanted i was downgraded without an apoligy by a very arrogant manager by the name of leo he mentioned out load the rate i paid booking com and the current rate without me asking out loud infront of other geusts there isnt no parking,0
 lovely breakfast comfortable stay ,1
 we loved the hotel and the staff graham he was amazing made us feel welcome,1
 they should let you know if its a basement room before booking and the rooms are a separate building to the main hotel not very clean stained carpet wifi does not work very well never again,0
 tiny hot room no space to work no room to unpack very loud due to street noise staff were indifferent very expensive i would have been better off traveling home in the evening and buying two day returns to london ,0
 the noise in the rooms at the front is horrendous it s like sleeping on a motorway and there is not even any double glazing there is soot on the window ledge due to the road pollution ,0
 but i found the staff to be a bit off and also the fire alarm went off which did disrupt us but we were given no apology,0
 superb lovely modern room very comfortable beds secure and safe hotel,1
 excellent customer service,1
 the staff was brilliant super friendly and very helpful quick to deliver on room service the communal rooms are amazing original character details with fireplaces and sofas a great space to have a drink or a bottle of wine the rooms are modern with everything you need and lots of personal touches from robes slippers to shaving kit toothbrushes in the bathroom all you need if you forgot to bring any of your toiletries our room looked across to other character buildings with views down to hyde park ,1
 i spend the weekend in the apex hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london for this thank you so much we will come back best regards theresa,1
 location and staff,1
 room cleanliness a coffee cup stayed on the table for 2 days unwashed internet could not even open video on facebook air conditioning had to complaint 3 times in 24 hours to have it fixed,0
 outstanding facilities spa was fabulous we did not use the restaurant as stayed in the city until late and ate there but they looked very inviting and definitely want to return and use very close to jubilee line and clipper boats taking you to the city both a 5 min walk from hotel rooms very comfortable spacious well equipped large comfortable bed with excellent linen good range of free beverages and large flat screen tv fantastic being able to use the pool and spa facilities after a busy day in the city to unwind as did not close until 24 00hrs ,1
 the shuttle service from canary wharf following a concert at the o2 was very poor and did not afford customers the time to get from the o2 my daughter and i were left stranded at canary wharf with no option to transport to the hotel the police took pity and returned us safely after 2 hours of trying to get back by public transport hotel staff had no interest when i attempted to discuss the issues the following morning ,0
 in the picture the room look nice actual not when i booked later on i received if i need to upgrade against payment which i did the hotel think the did it complements,0
 heating was down for a number of hours when we arrived was told it would be up and running around 5pm was still without any hot water until 10 30pm was offered a 10 discount on my next stay no thanks,0
 i had booked an executive double room and they gave us a room that was super tiny even though continental breakfast was included espresso was an extra charge ,0
 nothing,0
 staff were exceptional i wish there were a higher rating friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect this hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to london we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful the kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc and milk and water on the fridge plenty of wardrobe and storage space bathroom shower in particular was excellent breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl 14 floors highly organised and efficient wifi was great easily able to stream netflix etc and there was a big screen tv with many apps and all the premium channels ,1
 very classic hotel with very nice location staff there are all friendly and professional ,1
 really comfortable bed and a very quite room this hotel is perfect if you are wanting a good nights sleep i would definitely visit again staff very friendly and polite ,1
 very good location very clean smart hotel,1
 i loved it all it was very clean and very well taken care of the staff was so nice and helpful amazing the location was perfect and near everything ,1
 the staff very friendly and ready to give assistance,1
 closer to the transport links and cleaner rooms they were very old expected more for the price paid ,0
 first of all the hotel is supposed to be 4 star no way the rooms are threadbare unclean tv is run over coax so signal means tv virtually unwatchable was advertised as internet mini fridge in room yet got neither paid for internet but ended up using my phone for laptop connection the 2 x rooms we had were very unclean with torn bedding as noted by other guests the breakfast was cold again as noted by other guests i wish i had read all this pre booking car parking is 57 per night not 37 and the car was left unlocked by valet despite 3 x requests i am used to putting up sometimes with hotel descriptions that don t live up to the write up yet this is the first time i have ever written a review it really was that bad 57 per night for parking 8 for a can pint of guinness and 16 for cheese crackers they know how to charge however the hotel itself and the overworked staff are truly horrendous avoid ,0
 careful as the website images apart from exterior of the building look nothing like the actual hotel artistic licence being very creative my junior suite was reminiscent of bad student accommodation nothing 4 star about the 7th floor i complained if i hadn t they would have left me to it stripped me if 189 i was moved to the 5th floor because they knew exactly what i was talking about and they tried to charge me they saw the light when i shared my opinion of the hotel threatened to move hotel don t do it there are plenty of hotels that are more comfortable lovely better value for money in central london oh the wifi did not work ,0
 view from the room and room availability ,1
 first of all it is not a hotel of more than 2 people in a room why i was travelling with my family mum and dad and we took the family room my bed was a sofa bed half broken and a very thin mattres on it which its not even suitable for camping when we told the receptionist she told us do not worry you just sleep and you will go out and also when i need it cups for coffee she said this is not my job and she gave us like by force also note that this hotel does not have elevator sobif you have heavy laguages it will be difficult for you to get up the stairs our room was downstairs so we could listen screaming and footsteps all the time walking i do not recommend it sorry ,0
 clean modern hotel at good price for london close to hammersmith bus and tube stations,1
 tiny room despite paying extra no hot water for shower in the morning,0
 the staff were excellent in this busy hotel which clearly has a scottish family history breakfast was excellent plenty of staff available to bring tea coffee and a great choice aswell my stay was booked last minute and it will not be my last the location was just round the corncer form queensway tube great london hotel,1
 i was staying for 3 nights and the room was really too small they changed me to a larger room without any problem,1
 breakfast service was poor with 10 minute wait and limited service from over stretched staff,0
 very very very small room which must have previously been an entrance given that on the back of the bed there was a door no closet no space for the suitcase very small toilet ,0
 on arrival the receptionist was extremely helpful she gave us a map advised us on the quickest way to get to our destination and as we were leaving she called us a taxi the bar staff were very friendly to overall lovely stay ,1
 beds were absolutely terrible even for 165 per night i have slept on more comfortable floors ,0
 staff at reception wonderful and helpful,1
 very very unhelpful rude staff one lady and a man during the check in two visitors in front of us were treated badly without any respect not very well to us either even though they know that we are british couple next morning whilst waiting for check out they were found to be unhelpful to another visitor who was waiting for breakfast a long time the breakfast was a joke we will never stay there again very expensive to stay even in london standard the worn out room was just enough for the double bed we almost have to dive into the bed ,0
 they would not refund my money from a bad booking date on booking com ,0
 tiny room overcrowded breakfast buffet with low quality food ,0
 great location for the o2 obviously very friendly polite staff comfortable room with exceptionally comfortable bed fantastic breakfast and really enjoyed cocktails in the sky bar after seeing muse also really liked the pool gym and leisure facilities ,1
 the bed was nice,1
 everything,0
 location,1
 the room was ridiculously small no place to unpack no cupboard space the bedroom was smaller than the loo couldn t understand why there was a queen size bed in such a small room ,0
 i had to wait 3 plus hours to check in to my room because it wasn t ready ,0
 air conditioning didn t work and room was boiling do very poor night s sleep tiny room even though we were upgraded wotsits and sweet wrappers on floor ,0
 very clean hotel in a central location breakfast was included in price and was decent rooms were quiet and each had a fridge available ,1
 the complete package from a quality hotel,1
 loved the style of the hotel and personnel touches pool area was lovely and had 2 great massages the gym was impressive and mini bar was great ,1
 very old room dirty walls and scrapped furniture old dirty windows overall depressing,0
 rooms very small no need to put a two seater sofa in the room wet room was not nice at all smelt really bad ,0
 miserable staff not professional at all,0
 great service lovely rooftop bar,1
 i was excited to have a good stay in this hotel for the good location but unfortunately i shocked with the not clear and honest description for the facilities and rules they forced me to pay more and change my room and its not my fault to not have a good details in booking proceeded and i didn t have a good welcome by staff in arriving and the bathroom smell was disgusting they said through booking com all children under 12 are free for stay and that not true the booking com couldn t do anything and this is not the first time i had trouble with the booking com and they can t solve it before only saying sorry for what happen to you so this is the last time to book through them the hotel need to change their staff specially the night shift and have to fix their bathrooms and change their details of the facilities and the rules and we will see if booking com they clear to but my comments and review ,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really plump the bathroom was a descent size and the shower was especially good due to its size my wife and i also had food in the restaurant my steak was full of flavour and cooked to perfection and my wife really enjoyed her salmon i passed this view on to the chef because i think in england were to quick to complain and don t compliment very often the whole room was nicely decorated ,1
 location,1
 excellent breakfast staff very quiet room ,1
 first of all i have to say that amazing people are working at this hotel marie helen laure nordine and mazier it is impossible to accept them just as staff these people are great people warm and attentive with lovely sense of humor making you to feel that you are surrounded with close and really caring friends that s simply their nature the hotel itself is nicely designed i was staying on the 6th floor the room was functional and clean with very comfortable bed it was a bit small i mean the room but you don t waste time in the hotel room when you are in paris the location of the hotel is perfect in between two metro stations luxembourg and saint michel next to sorbone and a few steps from pantheon there is a bus station about 100 m from the hotel although in the middle of the city it was quite and peaceful the fountains on the plateau in front of the hotel were creating a specific atmosphere when in the room the feeling was like you are out of the city near some river or waterfall very relaxing there was an espresso making machine in the room with both regular and decaf coffee capsules and with a selection of tea breakfast was good nothing spectacular just good some standard ham and salami couple of traditional french cheese home made jam selection scrambled eggs with sausage croissant if you are staying in a hotel for more than one night a bit fantasy while creating the breakfast menu would be highly appreciated but again everything was very fresh nice and positive if your breakfast is not included in the room price you can have your morning coffee with fresh croissant for 2 2 euro just on the other side of the street also there are some restaurants and a marks and spencer express shop nearby in case of an emergency all in all it was really a positive experience definitely recommended hotel for your paris stay ,1
 there was dirt in the bath upon arrival gap in the bed which made it hard to sleep lift jammed when we were in it,0
 facilities were fantastic and staff couldn t do enough for you we re upgraded for free without asking to a room with river view excellent ,1
 nice birthday treat for my wife was planned with a weekend in london cranley hotel soon changed that 4 star really this should not be 4 star where to start with what is wrong with this so called 4 star hotel first of all checking in we were told our room number 402 fourth floor but lift only goes to third floor opening our door to the room we were instantly hit by the heat it was stifling even though window was open and it wasn t that hot outside under the window was a portable air con unit nice and noisy the carpet was stained and had a rip in it curtain had a large round stain on it the bed headboard was the worst of all filthy brown stains the room never cooled at all and we had to sleep on top of bedding in the morning half way through my shower no water phoned reception was told he would phone back in 5mins which he did was told to try now no explanation or apology breakfast was a joke continental haha toast or pastry fruit juice tea or coffee that was it if you have booked to stay here remember the room number 402 402 402 if you are given this room refuse instantly ,0
 the quality and professional staff were very impressive had a issue early on a sunday morning and the door staff and concierge were so helpful trying to find an open pharmacy location so close to the stadium means a five minute walk back and no sitting in car park for two hours trying to get out worth the cost alone ,1
 impressive venue,1
 not flixibll in checking out before the end of stated dates even it was a refundable terms of contract ,0
 shower wasn t working the whole week told them twice asked for a teeth rush they promised to deliver but they didn t waited more than 20 min to checkout early morning couldn t find anybody at the reception ,0
 bad service in my room no water no towels no clean bed sheets for the very first time,0
 great staff,1
 nice modern hotel close to transport ,1
 we stayed in a room with a view of the arc it was exceptionally nice all staff were helpful and made things easy the location is superb would definitely recommend cannot flaw anything ,1
 room was cozy as advertised meaning not enough room to walk around the bed i m not complaining it was a great price on the weekend of the london marathon ,1
 everything from check in takes a hour to check in had also other vip guests but the hotel was not flexible it was a nightmare stay wifi in this day and age is charged at 14 per day somehow the minister was offered twin beds but he wanted double to upgrade it was 60 per night again a complete rip off all complete with staff that are not as friendly and flexible will be writing to hilton head office but the stay was a nightmare,0
 food was excellent i ordered room service on both nights and it was exceptional,1
 the receptionist did not agree for early check in although the rooms were available and i requested this early they promised upon availability also she asked me the credit card and i told her to charge the amount from the same amount reserved on time of reservation she promised to do that but she reserved another amount on the time of check out her colleague informed me that she don t need to do that because the amount reserved in reservation is enough you know while traveling you don t want extra reserving with your credit card ,0
 excellent staff and great welcome to the hotel after checkin,1
 the building is very nice with antique details breakfast is really good really close to the underground station,1
 nice room,1
 the room very old and the clean was not good,0
 very inflexible with our booking on booking com website i added what i was looking for in the search bar stating a room for 2 adults and one 9 year old child it offered the rooms available at this hotel and having given the criteria i assumed the search would only reveal rooms which were suitable for me thinking it was suitable else why is it on the list given my criteria i clicked and gave card details booking was confirmed however i thought i had better check that this double would be suitable and i politely requested a small put up bed for the child as it showed a double room on my confirmation the hotel said no so i politely requested an extra pillow and duvet so we could make up a little bed on floor hotel said no i enquiries why not health and safety very very inflexible booking com appealed for their help with my booking no luck i also spoke to manager she refused and refused to let me cancel as i was within 24 hours of arrival date booking com were very helpful and couldn t understand the hotel s inflexible approach to my booking which was done in good faith and on the assumption that a little camp bed would be offered never assume very expensive hotel for what was offered decoration tired in places breakfast very average cheap marmalade and jam mass market stuff coffee and tea from vending machine all in all poor disappointing really as a little more flexibility would ensure a happy customer not so ,0
 there was no complimentary drinking water and no free wifi was told by the receptionist that it was a new building but the room and toilet didn t look new disappointed,0
 the staff at the lobby and bar was excellent nice bar and choice of drinks great place to work,1
 location location location,1
 i booked this hotel because it was close to a wedding reception that i was attending the added attraction was the website told me that the bar would show all major sporting events on its tv england vs ireland six nations fairly major not only was it not on but the bar was undergoing major refurbishment and was closed the hotel did seem to look like a building site and at 149 for one night room only i certainly didn t feel i was getting value for money i did mention this when i was checking out and was told that if i come again and tell them of my disappointment i would be upgraded not sure i ll be going again ,0
 the rooms were tiny no ceiling lighting in general worst value for money hotel i have stayed in ,0
 there are plenty of reason for why people should not stay at this hotel air conditioner it does not work as everybody can guess we just froze in the room in late september staff one of the staff knock our door twice at 11 pm while we stand up from our beds he opened our door and said we need to call reception i still could not get how such thing is possible why reception does not call rooms if they have something to say or the staff does not wait at least 10 seconds for door to be opened rooms the room was too old beds were uncomfortable the carpet was completely a cessful what is more there was such a disturbing smell coming from the toilet all the time wifi you need to pay for wireless if you want to connect from your room ,0
 go thick curtains blocked out light and noise ,1
 dirty old rooms for newly furnished room they asked us to pay extra on check in counter they will ask for higher floor newly furnished rooms extra bed not value of money at all when i requested for 1 hour late check out they gave me 45 mins funny for me anyways i ll not recommend this hotel for families as there is no place for shopping on walking distance other than m s it may be good for business travel,0
 bed and pillows were so so comfy very friendly and helpful staff very clean loved the sky bar views and the closeness to the o2,1
 the bed was tiny they moved us from one room which was supposed to be a suite with double single but both beds were tiny the room they moved us to was even smaller with the smallest double bed smallest room i have ever stayed in ,0
 the view from our corner room window was fantastic best seen at night ,1
 the worst hotel in my life stupid receptionist little and dirty room really noisy the breakfast terrible i ll not return,0
 room not executive standard restaurant too expensive and went out to eat everyday,0
 had to wait 45 minutes to be checked in because of a long queue booked an executive room had a standard double room got woken up 7 o clock both nights from the noise of the radiator and a c too tall for the shower maids kept opening my door asking if it was clean interior view with poor had wooden sliders for curtains breakfast was worse than school dinner ten years ago prisoners ate better during world war 2 most of the staff had poor english and bad manners,0
 i booked this room as a one night transit for my parents who are both in their 80s they had to fill a gap in their itineray so weren t going to stay long in any case if they had they would have moved the room they were allocated was terrible firstly the lift only went to the floor below and there were steep stairs up to their room which they found hard to climb secondly the room itself was tiny thirdly the bathroom was so small as to be almost unusable incredibly the toilet seat was a kids size apparently so the door clould just fit around it and the door to the shower was partially blocked by the other small fixtures in the tiny bathroom this hotel markets itself as an upmarket boutique luxury hotel it is anything but my parents did not cause a fuss as they were out again the next morning but considering the 5 star billing and prices it left a very bad taste in the mouth a ripoff be warned ,0
 nice room relaxing good food close to where we wanted to go,1
 not touristy at all loved the feel of staying in a real area of paris lovely bathroom sitting on our balcony and seeing families leave the restaurant across the road on sunday afternoon was delightful ,1
 terrible overpriced place avoid ,0
 sold as a family hotel when clearly it is not steps to hotel no access for disabled or pram users dining g area only had 1 high chair which we had to wait for,0
 see above it was aweful the room faced the rear and overlooked a vent ,0
 the place was very dated shabby not friendly too hot no cold water staff were miserable most of all it was dangerous when you open the windows no safety catches kids could fall out health and safety would have a ball they put us in the basement no windows no wardrobe no cold water never again not a 4 star hotel ,0
 everything,0
 it is not valid the money payed ,0
 i love the guys for room service as well as the doormen really friendly and helpful,1
 it was too noisy in the night and early morning couldn t sleep all night toilet and room weren t clean as per the standard its a 2 star hotel ,0
 hotel staffs were not trained at all the receptionists were rude and did not have any qualities match to the hotel brand name holiday inn i called the reception because our heating was not working but she hang up before i finished talking i just could not believe it also the insite parking was closed due to the refurblishment but there was no information about it when i booked with booking com so we had to park our brand new car in the street around i made a complain when i checked in but the receptionist accused me i was wrong that i did not check holiday inn website that was very very rude of her saying and i was pretty upset if people book through booking com or expedia or other websites she should know not all people check their official site to get information in advance i was treated with almost all the people working there with no respect if you know what good service is because you travel around all over the world this hotel is not for you they are in london but they do not have mentality as british i recommend not to chose this hotel if you expect excellent service from famous brand name ,0
 arriving to find they had over booked the hotel and promptly pushed into a small cold room attitude of checking in person poor which seemed to flow up to the manager ,0
 staff aren t friendly there are also additional charges if you want to use wifi gym etc ,0
 the leather panels were painted with some very strong volatile paint we had to sleep with the window wide open ,0
 the bedroom was described as an executive twin room but we could barely walk around the bed it was dim dingy and noisy not comfortable ,0
 pretty much everything the dulux room isn t very dulux at all i could hardly walk around the bed that room is that small there no storage space for your bags etc they have one cupboard wide enough to fit a couple shirts it s about 5inch deep there s was stains all over the curtains and carpet the bathroom is a tiny wet room where you have no space to actually move around ,0
 out of date milk dirty towels filthy fabrics unfriendly staff the bland food blocked sinks dirty toilets blocked drainage in the bath,0
 the room was so small you could touch both walls while in bed awful like a broom cupboard would never stay again,0
 good quality of the hotel concierge service nice lobby,1
 clean well equipped nice style comfortable ,1
 very central,1
 location very good nice architecture good staff ,1
 the room had no curtains and when reported they were aware of it but hadn t sorted it many complaints and requests to speak to the manager were met with being told to please be patient i had to make some curtains out of a towel bed throw and coat hangers 100 a night for a room that makes harry potters cupboard under the stairs look palatial and to bring your own curtains value for money i think not i was informed the manager would contact my by saturday afternoon 3 days later i m still waiting some of the staff were rude and almost put out by my complaint a shrug of the shoulders and a sorry is not an acceptable way to treat paying guests this hotel has the potential to be a good one a shake up of staff and some lessons in hospitality and the rooms having the basics should help with that do not be swayed by the photographs photoshop has be put to good use here ,0
 loveley staff everyone was willing to help the doorman was a true gentleman and simone from the reception was a wonderful guy i ll return definitely it was so clean especially for london area wonderful view overal just a 10 10,1
 the staff was increadibly polite and helpfull the building is fascinating everything in excellent condition there s no any microdust or neighter a spot in our well equiped modern rooms the beds our comfortable and clean made us feel us home the breakfast was if it had made for the prime minister we enjoyed the wide range of many sort of foods and the kindness of the staff special thanks for the hungarians there ,1
 the breakfast room facilities hotel location,1
 price vs room quality room is small located downstairs without elevator how can a family with small children carry all heavy luggages down without any staff help room was left uncleaned worst experience for family room very disappointed ,0
 we booked a double room and what we got was a tiny and noisy 9m2 room with a 3 m2 bathroom on the basement level the bed was not a double bed but a 1 2m wide single bed we complained twice at the reception and asked to speak to the management the only answer from the receptionist was we don t have another room a compensation was asked for but not granted not even an apology never again ,0
 excellent location very friendly staff,1
 i highly recommend this hotel excellent value for money in central london the architecture and the decor is remarkable my room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows and the bed was very comfortable in addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the hotel manager and it was great to see the receptionist cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism ,1
 good location staff very helpful,1
 air con was very noisy i actually tried to cancel the booking however it seems that the word exclusively after the permissible date of cancellation appears to mean it is the day before the hotel blamed booking com for the wording ,0
 uncomfortable bed very old you can feel the metal bit coming out everything is very old i was quite surprised such a beautiful area but is very poorly and old design hotel they need loads of investing me and boyfriend try to change it the other room but there all same room shame poor service they didnt fine my booking half an hour we were already late other meting in london many other thinks anyway bad experience will never go there again ,0
 urine on the toilet seat in our bedroom hadn t been cleaned only one pillow each rather uncomfy bed 50 for breakfast for two staff tried to charge my card twice for the room meaning it declined and utterly embarrassed me standing in reception ,0
 i dont even have availuble room before i came i have booked and reserved online and please check staff s attitudes and behaviours ,0
 the staff were not friendly and the breakfast was a poor selection for price and not refreshed ,0
 reception staff didnt know what they were doing it took so long to check in room was too small and the carpets looked so old and dirty and the bed was very hard and the tv channels were all mixed up with radio etc ,0
 they facility and service was very nice ,1
 great hotel in a great location we went to the o2 in the evening and this hotel is right next door modern feel and very clean,1
 great location friendly staff and clean rooms ,1
 creaky floorboards intermittent internet access bad food tiny pool disproportionate price to the quality of service,0
 we visited london for my sisters hen do just my mum sister and myself we checked in early at 10am but room wasn t ready so we ventured out and came back at 6pm we then found out our room had been given away so we were offered a double bed and sofa bed room and breakfast for free this was the only room available we were shown the room and it looked dirty and there was a dirty and used coffee cup we were then shown to another room which had to be ok as only other room available apparently we won t be returning in the future ,0
 charging for parking the reception on other building and no wi fi that works in the higher rooms ,0
 large bed view from room and bars restaurants friendly staff high tech rooms lighting and speaker in bathroom our mini bar was emptied after requested i said it was my partners birthday and the hotel put a happy birthday cake in our room waiting for us when we arrived nice touch the spa was lovely,1
 tiny rooms cheap bedding no kettle lights and useless gadgets everywhere which kept us awake ,0
 the room very few plugs no usb ports shower water temp unstable outdated loud construction heard in room everyday and i was not notified at booking,0
 the room was immaculate the views were fantastic and breakfast was wonderful altogether a fantastic experience there is also a walkway that connects the hotel to the o2 arena which was so convenient as it was raining the staff were exceptional extremely attentive and couldn t do enough for us thank you very much intercontinental ,1
 very good location and quiet for city centre hotel ,1
 the organisation of this place was ridiculous was given the wrong room in fact we had entered a room that was already occupied the ticket for room service wasn t taken and the toast on our breakfast wasn t even toast it was bread absolutely disgusting they kept giving us the wrong keys for the rooms eventually after 45 mins we was put in the right room not what we had chosen but it did ,0
 the staff was clueless,0
 the location was perfect staff polite and you had everything we needed to hand ,1
 convenient to local attractions and a family visit good sized suite which the kids loved and great bathroom with walkin rain shower and large bath,1
 my flight into heathrow was late and i arrived just before midnight at the hotel having previously booked a single room through the website i hadn t had dinner and was very hungry i was told that the restaurant that was advertised to be open until 1 am had been closed down the advertisements running on the television above the reception still had it as one of it s features i asked whether i could please have a quiet room and the receptionist said i could he didn t say anything else about the room i was a bit shocked when i was given an extremely small room without a window there was an airshaft in the ceiling with a grille and i wondered what it was for at about 5 30 a m i was awoken by a very loud noise it turned out to be a blast of cold air coming through the airshaft i looked for a button in the room to see whether i could switch it off but there was none it didn t stop and it was so loud that it was impossible to go back to sleep it was unbelievable i told the reception in the morning requesting a reduction in price it was 125 pounds and i was told they could only give 10 reduction i didn t feel that this was adequate and the receptionist said there was nothing that he could do he said i should write an email to customer services i have done this but don t have a reply yet ,0
 i have requested only one room for me and my wife and my two young childeren and they gave us two rooms it was not clear from the booking that they will give us two rooms the rooms are very small breakfast was not part of the booking plus parking the car was extra the price was very high for such a small hotel ,0
 on friday the 29th me and my partner came to london to celebrate her 21st birthday we booked with the mercure due to location and it s modest views it cost us 120 pound which to me for london is adequate for a 4 star hotel with breakfast however no where did it say there was no bar which was disappointing as it s on he pictures online the lift wasn t working which to be fair they offered to take our belongings upstairs for us that s not a major issue we could see they were having works done on the hotel that s not a problem it was the safety of the guests when we got back from the there we had to wait at the bottom of the stairs well a builder was chipping away at the glass with no cover what so ever it was falling on to the stairs it quite easily could of been someone s face also the banister was that lose on the stairs it come off when i mentioned the stairs all the member of staff did was kick it back in we then went to bed where next door a young child was crying for the best part of 2 hours and i get young babies cry but why put a young couple next to a family and children i called reception two times and no answer after listen to the child we eventually went to sleep the next morning we were provided with breakfast by garfuncals and was appalling the bacon was dry we had a spoonful of beens and the tomatoes were cold we did mention it and was offered another but we went else where when we got back to the hotel to collect the thing they then baracaded the stairs off and said lift only which to me i was dubious as it was down 3 hours before the place just looked like a building site considering i was trying to make my partners birthday her 21st special it was ruined by the hotel paying 120 pound for just a room and a rubbish breakfast is awful you go to places like london for the experience what was i paying for you had no bar or restaurant ,0
 staff were very helpful and nice to deal with ,1
 very small room window cannot be open very small bathroom ,0
 the hotel itself is beautiful the room was gorgeous and the bed was so comfy staff were really helpful and even allowed us to check in early breakfast was outstanding with a huge variety fab location for us attending the o2 with a walkway through the hotel directly into the o2 would definitely stay here again ,1
 location clean nice people,1
 room is not cleaned properly,0
 rough area of paris not a 5 star hotel 3 star at a push as the facilities are limited breakfast massively over priced 30 for just a standard fry up which is an absolute disgrace they will also charge you 25 extra on the day due booking com not charging correct room rates all in all a disgrace,0
 behaves of staff,0
 very unfriendly and dirty and it didnt had warm water at all,0
 we had a very poor experience the hotel had been taken over by the hilton group 2 days before i had 10 points to present to management after several discussions phone calls and e mails we had our money back ,0
 the place looks decrepit the lights in the room did not work impossible to see anything in the closets mildew in the closets we should have had a curtain to separate the double bed from the sofa bed but there was only a rod the showered did not work ,0
 furniture too too too old,0
 horrific weekend persuaded to upgrade when we arrived our upgraded room was over looking a building site not the river as assured we were unable to notice this when we initially went to the room as it was dark however at 6am the dlr started and then at 7am the building works started when we asked to speak to duty manager he was busy so waited when he finally came to talk to us it was apparent he had been busy having a cigarette we delayed speaking to anyone as i just wanted to get out of the hotel in the morning and try and enjoy the weekend so spoke upon our return early evening to which he told me i should have complained earlier we were eventually moved however to a smaller room despite paying upgrade when we went to our room to pack up our luggage before moving it was clear housekeeping hadn t cleaned anything just poorly made a bed in general the hotel was run down and in the middle of a building site a gin and tonic is served in a half pint glass lift glass is shattered and both rooms we had were freezing when we first entered as the heating is off until u go in ,0
 staff bed breakfast,0
 all the common areas the bar and the staff were all excellent ,1
 the hotel had no water running for almost 24 hours not even an apology from the staff couldn t shower or even flush the toilet staff kept telling us it should be on after an hour after 12 hours we called reception to complain and she laughed saying must be disgusting not being able to flush the toilet and offered us a voucher for a bottle of water due to this we was not able to enjoy our stay and could not even use the pool as we would not be able to shower and the guccusi was not working either all in all i believe a discount money back should have been arranged as this was disgraceful upon check out the receptionist just took our room keys and didn t even ask how out stay was if all facility s would have been working the hotel would be nice however this wasn t the case ,0
 great place to stay everything was perfect,1
 everything about it except,1
 friendly and helpful reception staff room configerato on family friendly,1
 great rooms excellent staff,1
 booked a double room which was actually two singles put together come on seriously you re rated as a 4 star hotel ,0
 shower head and drain did not work properly and our room flooded as a result apparently rooms are checked regularly which obviously isnt true ,0
 breakfast here is just amazing good selection stylish desinged restaurant and soft croissan you can t miss it room is cozy but it s enough space always tidy and clean such a well designed and fashionable ,1
 i like everything about the intercontinental hotel was very comfortable during my stay nice nd helpful staff ,1
 we had an emergency as our daughter developed a high grade fever and the hotel staff were completely useless inhumane rude and completely un understanding to delay the booking for two days although booking com approved it from their own rooms will never consider booking in this hotel that lacks any common sense they were just happy taking our 240 for nothing terrible experience and highly unrecommended the duty manager called david would not even bother answering our calls he even had the audacity to suggest that we find someone to stay with our kid so we don t lose our booking as if we were going to leave a 4 year old on their own but a 4 year old with high grade fever would not want anyone but their mum then they asked for a doctors note if they had any common sense they would understand you do not take a kid to a gp until 3rd day of fever and imagine getting the doctors note just for a hotel booking just a complete and utter horrible experience ,0
 great room really comfy beds ,1
 it was outdated and not very clean,0
 the style of the hotel,1
 our room was in the wing far too small for a double bed and 2 people it was on the 7th floor and only 1 lift was working for our entire stay the reception staff spoke poor english ,0
 clean friendly staff good location,1
 there was no power from 2pm to 7 15pm and the organsation was very poor when it did come back on the tv did not work and i could not access internet the aircon was also not working properley ,0
 the room is old and ugly the ceiling in the bathroom is kind of disgusting the bed seemed to be broken on the left side it made a loud noise every time my husband got out of the bed the accommodation is definitely not the level of a four star hotel last year i stayed at novotel in berlin which is by far nicer cleaner and more beautiful this hotel was quite disappointing ,0
 wifi was not working well the location was too far from the city of london ,0
 bfast room was over capacity at all times and practically unnavigable room was next to a private residence that was so loud and staff reacted unapologetically and w o offer for a room change manager contact was suggested but then made difficult by staff stating unknown scheduling of when the manager would be in and the biz cards they had only listed the hotel phone number lightbulbs were burned out bathroom lighting was impossible when in front of the vanity mirror ,0
 great location on the south bank lots of restraints entertainment or just a walk along the river great views of westminster big ben somerset house london eye staff very helpful even when busy rooms very quiet great facilities breakfast plentiful ,1
 amazing customer service solved problems and offered solutions ,1
 cleanliness personell availability queue at check in really not diverse breakfast no minibar products even though the hotel blocked money on my credit card ,0
 the attitude of the staff ,0
 complete chaos at the reception i was given an occupied room twice and got stuck in the elevator in the meantime light switches were very dirty and the room was small and noisy my colleague had the exact same experience not worth the price ,0
 the pictures shown at the webpage does not match the general condition of the hotel the place is worn down breakfast was not to standards of a 4 star hotel ,0
 property is nice and clean with victorian style interiors love the cozy rooms got a good deal via booking com,1
 extra attention to detail,1
 staff,0
 we had a large newly refurbished room which had been elegantly decorated the bathroom was very large and spotlessly clean when we returned from an evening out the towels we had used had been replaced and the bins emptied our pre theatre dinner was good with excellent service from our waiter who completely understood that we had only limited time ,1
 la decoration design,1
 the executive room was poor and definitely not value for money our room was inward facing basically it s outlook was other rooms in the square not what you d expect for the nightly price of 240 the bed was small and there was no choice of pillows they were all hard and did not mould to accommodate your head the bathroom was fairly spacious but looked tired and there was no wow factor to it the staff were pleasant but it felt as if this was more out of contractual obligation rather than any real desire to please overall we were very disappointed and wouldn t recommend this hotel ,0
 everything was perfect just like last time ,1
 everythings,1
 do not stay in this hotel this hotel is the worst hotel i ever been totally ruin it my trip in paris no internet for the first day slow wifi that i can t work during my trip i ve told them many times and they don t fix it the service is terrible with really bad attitude our dryer was broken and have strange noise we are fighting with the service every day and night and no one will help you this hotel does not worth any ,0
 very nice old hotel with a great climate ,1
 small rooms smelly corridors no soundproof fake pictures on the offer there are superior classic rooms and superior delux classic are actually former rooms of the servants with separate staircase etc etc,0
 room extremely small for the cost no bath floor area of bathroom was 1 metre sq no notice of my special request was taken breakfast cost was extremely expensive,0
 staff really friendly,1
 excellent location and very welcoming staff great to spend a couple of nights at one of the most desirable postcodes in the country ,1
 breakfast choice and quality was excellent,1
 the staff were very friendly and helpful rooms s good size nice bathrooms bar area very comfortable complimentary drink a nice touch a little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around plans for development look amazing would like come back when completed ,1
 great location to explore london,1
 location decor in the foyer ,1
 door handle not working tap in the bath room not working i have to tighten myself i was given a handicap room where shower room is not enclosed water splash all over the place very messy hotel prvoided a service for manicure at 80 and i asked for it however after the service i was charged 160 without my consent claiming additional service done but without telling me till i checked out i have to argue to get it rejected i feel the hotel has poor service in this area ,0
 hot water is rare and scarce resource you have to wait 5 7 minutes before you get any if at all water pressure is so low that you have a choice take a ice cold shower or not to take it ,0
 surely not value for money linen was not changed in 7 days when i moved the beds after the stay to check if i had left something behind dirt and old broken ear phones were left behind so definitely the beds weren t moved to clean,0
 location size of rooms ,1
 the fact that the room we stayed in had been refurbished to a good standard bed very comfortable ten minutes walk from kings cross all staff very cheerful ,1
 luggage handling,0
 unable to procure coffee for the in room coffee maker it became a farce ,0
 most things really noisy and not value for money,0
 the staff i told the front desk it was my birthday which it was and no complimentary treats cake wine voucher for a dinner night or thank you s to me for choosing this place then someone or housekeeping sole my diamond ring the front desk manager was less than helpful in resolving the situation and had no sense of urgency oh did i mention that their security door equipment didn t work to modify who goes in and out of the room the interior of the room is soooooo out dated for what they charge per night the layout of the room didn t make sense either there s no outlets by the bed you have to lay at the foot of the bed to use the desk outlet or the t v s usb the view i had was horrible this hotel was the worse experience i d ever had in all my years of traveling i do not recommend you waste your time here nor spend your money for their terrible service find another hotel you will be better off ,0
 very good hotel and i was happy with the service i got there the staff members were very friendly and extremely helpful absolute value for money compared to the crazy hotel prices in paris i was supposed to pay much before i checked in since it was a booking that couldn t have been cancelled for some reason the hotel was unable to charge my card i requested them to wait till i arrived for my stay to pay in advance and they gladly accepted that and waited for me mentioning this because i have had instances before where even 5 star hotels have not waited and cancelled my booking so great job by pullman bercy and would absolutely recommend this to others it is close to cour de saint emilion metro station to bercy village and a couple other places where one can hang out 20 mins away from triumph de arc at champs de elysees which is one of the tourist spots too good coffee for breakfast and has a great yellow coloured apricot bread which one must try for sure ,1
 good location friendly staff honoured our promise of an upgrade,1
 the air conditioning did not work on the hottest day in paris complained five times and told the technician was fixing it they only changed my room when i was about to move out,0
 everything was very close few minutes walking and you were in the middle of everything the staff were very kind they would not let you go out in the rain without an umbrella was very clean room was huge beds super comfy food on point the doormen were very friendly and made you fell welcome was like a home away from home would highly recommend to everyone amazballs xoxo gossip girl,1
 staff,0
 shower was broken and the receptionist told me it was probably because i did not understand how to use it tv remote and tv were struggling etc probably ok 15 years ago ,0
 lifts not working poor breakfast very narrow staircase reception in the restaurant bizzare ,0
 great location ,1
 staff very friendly and helpful hotel is beautiful the theatre bar is gorgeous location is on a quiet road but close to tube and other shops and places to eat,1
 elevator did not work for 2 days the corridors and the room were smelly they should air rate the place the windows were not sound proof so the noise from the street can be heared in the room there was a refrigerator in the room but it was empty except for 2 bottles of water so i have to go out get some snacks ,0

 we loved everything about staying at apex temple court hotel the staff was nice perfect located the room was big bright and clean bed and pillows very comfortable and furnishing were modern the club lounge was the best we will definitely stay there next time we go to london ,1
 the lovely letter left by the lady cleaning our room giving her number if we needed anything cocktail bar staff were amazing walking distance to centre of london security was excellent as all visitors to bar were asked to show a card confirming they were guests before gaining entry ,1
 the staff made me feel at home in both their hotel and the city of paris i felt like family ,1
 location is excellent great soundproofing,1
 power cut on the first night despite the two cafes either side still having full power no lifts no lights in the room so couldn t use the bathroom as it was windowless no apology from the staff we asked how to use the safe a staff member was promised to visit our room but he she never materialised so completely wasted our time very expensive breakfast at 15 euros per person across the road we got two hot baguettes fruit fruit juice and tea for half that price paris was lovely the hotel was awful will not be using holiday inn again,0
 i paid 321 for 1 nights stay and didnt even get breakfast ,0

 fantastic staff who showed us a good way to get to the apollo or our concert shower in the room was fab comfortable bed as well oh i have to mention the burger we bought from the room service menu it was amazing i am tempted to go back just to have another we used the bar after the concert and it was lovely all in all if we have another concert at the apollo we will definitely stay here ,1
 the personalities of the staff shone the warmest of welcomes and each interaction professional and yet interested in our day such lovely people ,1
 small room air con not working windows didn t open boiling hot not great bed poor quality room in an overpriced hotel 2 3 star b b type quality at 180 per night ,0
 everything was right with the room bed was comfy and the marble lobby quite a sight for tired eyes ,1
 the hotel is located close to many amenities the room was clean and comfortable the staff was very amenable and agreeable to us checking in a bit earlier and checking out a bit later which enhanced our stay ,1
 this hotel was really great the room a suite was perfect for travelling with young children the room had an upstairs bed room and the pull out bed downstairs was perfect for the kids there is a metro station 5 minutes from hotel the breakfast was really good with lots on offer for everyone it helped to keep us going for the day this is a hotel we will be back to ,1
 i stayed in room g2 effectively it was a porch that had been converted into the smallest room i have ever been in bed wasn t even a full sized single more doors and windows than walls must have been next to vent from kitchen as woke up to the smells of a greasy breakfast,0
 electrics dangerous in our room,0
 the room was not good at all it wasn t clean the bathroom i ve never seen something like this in my whole life some things shouldn t happen in 4 stars hotel we asked to change room at the beginning they told us there weren t rooms available eventually they gave us a twin room the day after they told us since it was a better room that we would had have pay to stay in that one we didn t want to have other surprises so we accepted the new room was not bad though but we were disappointed ,0
 room 801 small noisy avoid some staff rude not a 5 star or worth the money ,0
 i was so disappointed having stayed at the taj dubai i was really looking forward to my stay however the taj st james was a complete disappointment we were moved three times in ten days because we complained firstly because of the filthy room that we were put into classic studio 261 then because of the noise from a guest in the room above 361 and the third room was an upgrade to a contemporary style suite which smelt of smoke very very disappointing we should have been relocated to a better standard of room after the first room that we were allocated pubic hair visible in the bathroom suspicious staining on the couch and the bed cover the hotel is tired and needs a makeover the furnishings have past their best by a number of years ,0
 everything in the hotel,1
 walking distance to the villa staffs are friendly and helpful ,1
 everything was great the staff are very helpful and kind breakfast was limited in choices but yummy ,1
 breakfast was not edible we couldn t have breakfast in the normal restaurant as it was packed so was shipped off to a large cold meeting room for breakfast where it was served freezing bathroom was not clean and then service was very poor for such a busy and big hotel it had potential but was let down completely,0
 micro size room sleepless due to road noise poor room facilities no air cooling system shower handles jammed not for disabled no sound proofing on walls or windows window shutter jammed poor blinds on window no space for suitcase no wardrobe for clothes ,0
 great location and lovely room ,1
 absolutely no room in the standard sized rooms also the receptionist who checked us in expected 4 of us to sleep in 1 small double bed she argued with us when we said we had booked 2 rooms very rude ,0

 breakfast shower dirty,0
 the staff is ignorant liars,0
 pillow game is strong,1
 comfortable room in excellent location ,1
 excellent location friendly staff great room fast wi fi would definitely stop here again ,1
 small room and twin bade,0
 this hotel markets itself as a 4 star and charges four star prices i suspect the french don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star there was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for 5 minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money,0
 staff not very helpful the bathroom never had towels we have to ask for them the bed was not comfortable,0
 cleanliness was not good in the bathroom dirty windows chipped bath and sink plug failed to operate trays left in corridor and they began to smell carpets in corridors were worn breakfast bacon very greasy and scrambled egg very watery nespresso machine broke down and was inadequate to supply the number of guests ,0
 the room was clean modern and nicely decorated and truly spacious for london standards towels changed daily good bed and comfy bedding two different pillows to choose between there was even one c e f type socket as used in the rest of europe in the room the location of the hotel is also pretty good although the nearest underground station king s cross is 1 5 km away ,1
 the mattes is old and not comfortable they gave us room in the basement level of cleanses is low ,0
 first class hotel as always ,1
 fantastic hotel,1
 the hotel has seen better days the d cor generally was tired various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use the room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on the staff were generally uninterested on early arrival i asked if i could have access to the room to get changed as i had cut my leg while travelling i wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it two of the three staff members i asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury the third staff member offered me a band aid and use of the ladies toilets its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle five minutes in the room or any room and i would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue i particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room he implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while i m standing at reception bleeding i wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened i further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay they didn t instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake i remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened breakfast was average service remained indifferent not what i expect from a four star hotel i wouldn t recommend or return to it ,0
 rude staff key didn t work properly gob on the floor in reception ,0
 staff were brilliant couldn t have been more attentive but not in your face very customer focussed super impressed great breakfast choices ,1
 great hotel and great location ,1
 staff were extremely friendly and efficient i mentioned that we were taking the trip to celebrate my husband s birthday so staff arranged for chocolates to be left in the room which was a lovely surprise breakfast really good too ,1
 i love the large towels i liked the computor room so i could check in for my flight the staff were extremely helpful,1
 the helpful staff lovely building comfortable room ,1
 room to small the bathroom was not spacious enough the design of the room was not appropriate they did not provide coffee and tea even cattel was so poor,0
 close to apollo we were going to a concert there clean good value for money tube station near by for easy access into central london ,1
 staff were very helpful and efficient the location is excellent with both underground and buses just around the corner the room was ample and comfortable we enjoyed our three days here ,1
 staff were really helpful on arrival and made the checking in process a straight forward one even took the time to show us an alternative room on arrival,1
 this is an old hotel the rooms need refurb we checked into our room and the toilet hadn t been cleaned and was disgusting they did however move us to another room but not the type of thing you want to be doing at midnight with a small child after a long flight ,0
 lovely setting and decor ,1
 wonderful staff so switched on and so genuinely helpful and concerned about pleasing guests,1
 we booked the room on behalf of our colleague because it was a retirement gift from the company i booked the room at the end of april using a business credit card which was then shown on my boss s statement that payment had gone through as we knew it would because it was a non transferable no cancellation booking i even called the hotel at the time and they said the payment will go through within the next couple of days there was no mention when booking with youselves that it was the policy of the hotel that you still have to produce the credit card even though it was already paid for on mr simons arrival which was supposed to be a relaxing time was asked to produce the card and was advised from the management that they couldn t except the payment for his booking without the card even though it was paid by our company how ridiculous he then had to pay for the already paid room from his own money and was given a refund statement for the other payment this whole situation is extremely disappointing unnecessary and an embarrassment for our colleague ,0
 reception and concierge staff were very welcoming and friendly the location can t be beat for tube nearby and boris bike stands there s a pret a manger for quick bites and breakfrast and brunswick square also has loads of shops ,1
 i hated this hotel location staff attitude room interior not even clean they charged me more than my rate and didn t get any refund yet and they said i better book through them not booking com,0
 the place is good only in case if you are visiting place near by staff is not helpful ,0
 the lobby s design and the staff there were really nice and quite warm hearted some gifts have been prepared for free like wine chocolates and fruits ,1
 location small not so new,0
 very comfy bed ,1
 ended up in a smoking room last rooms available i didnt think there were any smoking hotel rooms any more i stank of smoke for meetings next day staff were apologetic and explained rooms were allocated in turn with these smelly rooms last the hotel was full that night and i was last i would of preferred to know this up front and choose to stay somewhere else ,0
 i liked the doorman who showed us to our room made us feel very grown up lol,1
 bed was uncomfortable was given 2 twin beds when i asked for a double,0
 the room was exceedingly comfortable very very clean much better than some london 5 star rooms very impressed one tiny problem was i had zero connection to my phone breakfast was excellent price very good i will definitely stay again as the hotel is perfectly situated for the heart of london ,1
 staff were outstanding made us feel special really good nights sleep beds really comfy i could go on and on but probably best hotel we have ever stayed in,1
 beds comfy lots of lovely hot water tea and coffee in room very good always time for a cuppa,1
 the rooms were incredibly small and cramped we struggled to even get through the door to our room the rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet the hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases ,0
 the hotel was ideal for the o2 the facilities were excellent and the catering very enjoyable ,1
 excellent staff attitude,1
 helpful and friendly staff,1

 i d booked a room for 2 people my fellow traveller wasn t with me due to health reasons but i hadn t informed the hotel of this however once i d checked in i d found my room was actually a single bed in a tiny room which was swelteringly hot after an uncomfortable nights sleep i went down to breakfast after upgrading to include breakfast for a whopping 15 i was greeted by the most disgusting breakfast buffet i d seen it was grubby the meat was swimming in fat all of the food was tepid i could only bring myself to have a piece of toast the original victorian fixtures and amazing wooden panelling in the foyer do not make up for the appalling stay i had ,0
 good selection great scrambled eggs,1
 he to wait 40min for a room to beavailable after being put in a room with 3 single beds when a double room was booked,0
 hotel front very impressive facade lobby staircases doorman excellent staff and service throughout the stay shower clean and fresh towels and shampoo body wash lotion provided every day good mirrors well lit cupboard and safe with coffee making facilities tvs and wifi superb location 1 minute from russell square station bus stops a tesco express pret and the brunswick mall brimming with restaurants and convenient stores also 10 mins from the britush museum a very big plus ,1
 it s seriously not a 4 star hotel it s basically a cramped travelodge in an architecturally nice location i ve literally stayed in better premier inns and if i d payed full price for the room i d have been livid indifferent staff directing at breakfast made me feel like i was constantly in the wrong place and liable to be charged extras at any time not a nice feeling ,0
 excellent services very nice clean room comfy bed tasty breakfast and gorgeous bar the cocktails in the sky bar are amazing the staff is very friendly and helpful ,1
 lovely cool fresh apples on a hot summers day was a nice treat ,1
 two wings concept,0
 no hot water so unable to have a shower toaster was useless staff on reception were unhelpful and gave promise that hot water would be available shortly i waited and made myself late for my meeting and yet still no hot water,0
 staff were very welcoming clean room and very spacious location was excellent would definitely recommend ,1
 the room we had was awful absolutely stunk of cigarette smoke had to pay to use the wifi which is such a joke after paying so much to stay there and don t think the service was up to standard for a hilton hotel as stayed in many before over the world ,0
 tired decor in need of refeb iron and heater in room did not work breakfast area was uninviting and dank looking ,0
 everything rude unhelpful ignorant staff including the incompetent owner food order took over an hour for nachos and a salad coffee s etc never arrived despite continually asking staff walk in without knocking or stating first and the place stinks of a filthy pond whuchbthey have tried to cover up with air fresheners disgusting filthy place bath doesnt drain toilet seat isnt secured on toilet doesnt flush shocking the list is endless outside its like being in the ghetto hooded gangs congregated everywhere ,0
 tray in room with coffee sachets and kettle ,1
 no effort made for our anniversary even though informed beforehand i asked to change rooms to at least have a view of the river as opposed to a building site no joy so will not be staying here again ,0

 the wonderful old fashioned customer service the fantastic interior and bar and the decor and location,1
 room upgraded for free lovely decor downstairs,1
 location is great ,1
 the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable quiet but close to all our needs room was affordable luxury highly recommend ,1
 one of the worst beds every to sleep on the room had no ac which apparently is only offered in upgraded rooms i find that silly and petty thanks for the fan overall it was a bit over priced for what you get when one stays in a hotel they usually want a great bed and comfortable room this was below average in both areas the toilet had a heated towel unit that was kept together with electrical tape and exposed wires not what i expect from a hotel of this calibre ,0
 the bed was very comfortable room very clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful,1
 terrible location and very noisy area ,0

 very friendly helpful staff ground floor kept in it s original style good value breakfast ,1
 the room was extremely dusty the bath room was too cramped with the toilet seat very close to the wash basin and the shower size is too small where one can t have a proper shower the shower may actually end up being a hazard in case you may slip and you may end up breaking some bones or atleast getting a significant sprain the breakfast didnt have too many chioces ,0
 room contents staff and location ,1
 friendly staff ,1
 very tired place noisy in the room ,0
 the rooms r too small the price is high consider the room size,0

 the room was so clean and tidy the bed was amazingly comfey and so big,1

 breakfast was excellent,1
 damp room with a clear smell of mildew mind you my room was in the basement but otherwise it was clean very thin walls and the internet was spotty i had some uncommonly loud neighbors that broke the rules and smoked in the hallways who did not make the stay restful but i cannot blame that on the hotel ,0
 some of the reception staff were unfriendly and rude the air conditioning didn t work properly in the room and it was like a sauna we also requested room service which took 2 phone calls over the period of an hour and a half to arrive ,0
 glass on bathroom floor kettle didn t work air con didn t work,0
 when they cleaned the room they took my shirt and then they told me it was something that usually happened and they laughed at me inside,0
 customer service and room and the money i have paid,0

 house keeping is bad don t provide shampoo and body wash i have to call house keeping every night when i get back to my room ,0

 excellent hotel and good value helpful concierge to leave bags checked in early and was no problem v comfortable ,1
 comfy beds very clean tea making facilities and microwave in bedroom,1
 location value for money and building,1
 the room was in the basement which i didn t mind but 2 ceiling lights didn t work and the bedside lights didn t work heating didn t appear to work on the saturday and sunday the bathroom stunk of raw sewage and made the stay unpleasant i wasn t even asked by staff how my stay was when i left,0
 the room,0
 they had no minibar inside the room,0
 first time in hotel i was told that i will get the room which has no view from window and has other problems just becouse i had discount for early booking nothing helped to change the room even that it was my birthday day they didn t even say happy birthday bathroom was very cold and smell not good and a lot more ,0
 hotel design is excellent staff were amazing location was perfect ,1
 location and quiet room,1
 the staff were outstanding,1
 as we was attending a concert for a special christmas treat i asked if we could check in one hour earlier than 3pm we arrived at 2pm but was told the room was not ready and to wait while housekeeping cleaned the room we waited and waited and waited till just after 4pm this didn t give us any relaxing time and went straight to dinner at the pub next door as the restaurant was not open till later before going to dinner we pre ordered a taxi to go to the o2 for 6pm at 6pm we went to the taxi area to be told the taxi wasn t there and will be around 30 40 minutes till it would be back and the hotel only has one taxi this was very stressful and we dod try to call our own but the other taxi ranks said it would take them about 30 minutes to come to the hotel our taxi articed at 7 15pm after a very poor start to our christmas treat once back in our hotel room with two children ready for bed the room was very very cold so tried to turn the thermostat up on the wall but the heating didnt work in our room it was 11 30pm and didn t want housekeeping coming to fix it at that time in the night so it was a very cold nights sleep ,0
 good size rooms ,1
 the room was dull dirty carpet and disgusting chair covered in stains the was a stale smell of old perfume and the heating and air conditioning didn t work properly the shower head was old and the bathroom small i don t think this hotel deserves 4 star status ,0
 absolutely amazing the staff are so friendly and helpful and our surprise was so unexpected thank you so so much,1

 first the bed broken and no maintance staff to repair i did repair with the hotel tools dated 31 12 2015 second the rooms and the coredors was full on cigarets smoke third the safe box battery is low we asked the staff to replce no respond ,0
 the hotel room itself was terrible nothing like the picture the bed was as tiny as the room not comfortable at all it felt more like a suffocating box with a view on other boxes rather than a comfortable hotel with a view on the arch of triumph,0
 me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel the location is only 10 minutes walking from luxembourg rer station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g palais du luxembourg and odeon theatre the room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable the best thing about the room was the view we asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the 6th floor with stunning view of eiffel tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good indonesian restaurant named indonesia really worth a try please google the location for details ,1
 clean room great breakfast,1
 being made to wait for our room to be ready not ready till 4 45pm when told would be ready by 12 noon,0
 clean and comfy with a good breakfast choice ,1
 can t recommend this place enough and i visit london every month fantastic friendly professional staff impeccable service nice quiet rooms comfortable beds room service was quick and good bar is perfect for a work coffee or an evening cocktail there were lots of nice touches from the call just after arrival to ask if there was anything else the hotel could do or provide to water at turndown to the ziplock bag which appeared in the bathroom the night before checkout the pool is lovely no chlorine and just the right temperature but above all it s the staff one of the best run hotels i ve ever seen ,1
 the entrance and lobby area are stunning lovely smell of fresh lilies comfortable lounge ,1
 no elevator struggle for aged mother to combat 7 flights of stairs staff unhelpful bathroom in need of update,0

 noisy the hotel was very noisy as one heard noise from the street as well as from the corridor and other rooms a lot more than in other hotels cleaning the cleaning of the room was not very thorough broken window the window in the room couldn t open as the handle was broken i reported this to the reception but in the following days didn t hear anything back because the window couldn t open the temperature and air in the room were not pleasant ,0

 everything,0
 our room wasn t clean properly when we arrived late afternoon we reported it to the reception asking for a more efficient cleaning next morning but there was still dust on the blinders enough to write your name on it there is noise from oxford str and from a nearby construction which is really annoying and wakes you up from 7am the cleaning room service staff wasn t qualified we asked for an extra bed in the room the man who brought it left all the plastic covers tapes extra pillowcases in the room when he finished not to mention that he was t able to set the extra bed by himself and we had to help him there is only an open wardrobe no room for socks tights underwears etc the reception is really small and gets overcrowded with 4 5 persons ,0
 food lovey rooms very nice,1
 went to extra effort knowing it was my wife s birthday gifts etc great location from euston and to covent gdn and theatre breakfast was exceptional,1

 the hotel was conveniently close to hyde park where we liked to walk it was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services a convenience store was close by the hotel is a lovely old london town house style and the reception hall and public areas i would describe as baronial the staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable ,1

 breakfast very expensive no bar in the hotel no restaurants in the general area f,0
 amazing staff ,1
 all,0
 temperature control which worked to cool the room less creaky floorboards the whole floor creaked and there was a pillar right next to the bed which was a total obstruction and could have proved quite hazardous if i d walked into it in the night a better organised breakfast where staff cleaned down used tables and reset them within a few minutes to reduce the queue size ,0
 the location was good and the staff were very friendly ,1
 fantastic breakfast ,1
 the location is great very easy reach of the london eye south bank and westminster,1

 friendly man on reception,1
 location to hammersmith eventium and tube station excellent choice at breakfast ,1
 nice staff clean and comfortable rooms,1
 staff didn t respond in an effective time frame for problems we had with our room also they were painting when we arrived so it was difficult to get to our room and they didn t clean up effectively so the next morning they made a great deal of noise while cleaning up very frustrating ,0
 this place is fantastic will definitely stay again room and spa facilities outstanding a must if you re visiting the o2 18th floor cocktail bar was great with fabulous views over canary wharf ,1
 there were hairs in my bed and in my bathroom the pizza was disgusting and i could not eat it the breakfast was cold internet was not free very dated hotel ,0
 the staff was unabke even to smile or to give any explanation as to where to go for having dinner the room was not cleaned nor arranged for the second night ,0
 in the basement poor light right below reception so could here everything noisey all night never slept both days there plus waitress at breakfast was very rude,0
 i rented a room at this hotel i paid full rent rooms and i have to deposit 120 which ended six holiday and go home but they said to me they will pay 120 back into my account but i do not think that they deposit into my account ,0
 the room was too small ,0
 staff had lack of english the corridors smelled like ashtrays the rooms whore tiny boxes the mattress has seen better days years they do not provide a car park too expensive for what we experienced problem with payment transaction they charged us twice we do not recommend ,0
 no fridge in the room no open window so very poor air conditions in the room due limited fresh air,0
 all good,1
 a fabulous hotel reception staff were welcoming and professional our room was lovely with amazing views excellent air con system and great bathroom with separate bath and shower food was good and the covered walkway to the o2 is really useful location couldn t have been better as we were there for an o2 event the hotel is also right next to the thames path which provides a nice flat walk down to greenwich or in the other direction ,1
 actually everything was more than perfect until the last day of our stay last day the lady at the reception desk asked me and my fiance that we need a taxi for airport transport we said ok and left the hotel to use our last day when we came back to take our luggages the driver was waiting for us inside the hotel due to my previous negative experiences as a tourist i asked the driver about the fee and offered him 55 which was a fixed fee that we paid when we arrived the city the driver also confirmed the fee but on the highway he locked the doors of the car and threated us to pay additional 15 we ended up the trip at the police station cause we did not want to pay an additional fee that we did not ever talked before we were already missing our flight to istanbul cause the issue was not resolved even in the police station so i called the hotel to asked them being witness cause all the negotiation process before the trip occured infront of the lady at the reception unfortunately we did not get enough support from her and we had to pay 15 in order to catch our flight we really felt cheated and just writing this comment to warn everyone please be aware about the taxi company that the hotel is in cooperation ,0
 location and quality of food,1
 the room was in need of refurbishment and re decorating there were many chips in the kitchen sink etc and lots of noise coming from the building next door ,0
 near to hyde park which is what we wanted,1
 very nice hotel,1
 friendly and helpful staff location comfort quiet room,1
 the room we had was perfect for the three days we spent there and the bathroom was top class ,1
 nice location super helpful front desk staff ,1
 great location but high cost,1
 nothing,0
 the room was not as per the picture the safe did not work there was no shower and the bath tub plug did not work breakfast was poor and had no selection overall terrible and i would not prescribe anyone to stay there absolutely terrible all round gbb,0
 breakfast was definitely one of the best parts of this hotel to be able to get up in the morning with two kids and have a full breakfast made was invaluable my kids could not get enough of agatha one of the breakfast hosts she was fantastic which made the mornings a breeze ,1
 the rooms are very large and clean,1
 everything could not fault it,1
 the variety at breakfast the bed which was very comfortable the approachable friendly staff who were very good with grandchildren who came to visit at the hotel the spaciousness and airiness of the hotel and wonderful views ,1
 room did not look like anything in the pictures they advertise on booking websites it was a tiny tiny shoebox room in the basement with a really smelly and dirty bathroom and there was dust everywhere like no one had stayed there in a long time and it hadn t been cleaned in awhile was super cold too down there ,0
 everything this was worse than staying outside do not waste your money ,0
 spa rooms distance to 02 reception staff excellent,1
 i traveled for business to london i booked a deluxe king room which is the highest category apart from a suite when i arrived to check in i filled the information card i ve seen that my room is on the 3rd floor out of 4 and i asked if they have a room on a higher floor the lady started checking and said no and that my room is not yet ready time was 14 40 i explain that i m after a long flight and i request that she ll allocate another room she called the duty manager that also started checking and said he has nothing available and what do you want me to do i told him that he can upgrade me to a suite change room allocation many thing just find me a room he said he can do nothing and that is it at that point i said okay i ll wait for the room than he said that my room is on the basement level i said excuse me on the info letter i just filled it is written that my room is on the 3rd floor he said that a mistake and that he have only 3 room in that category and the only one available is the basement i should have leave the hotel at that point but didnt because i was tired after a long flight so he suggested to downgrade my room to a king room on the 2nd floor the room was small as a shoe box i ve been around the globe for business this is the first time i encounter such a poor dis receptive service from hilton hotels after this experience i will never stay at an hilton hotel as not other in my company ,0
 location near to russell square station and other transport,1
 have asked for a quiet room but cannot sleep even after midnight cos of noisy surroundings ,0
 the genuine cheerfulness of the whole staff ,1
 complimentary upgrade to executive suite when arrived ,1
 very nice hotel staff very good breakfast excellent great formal areas we had a deluxe double which was very small though but this wasn t really a problem as there were great lounges etc,1
 the staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants ,1
 the reception clerks we very helpful and accomodating the location is quiet and very proximate to the heart of the city ,1
 quality of the rooms,0
 the location is fantastic literally walking distance to all the major sites ambience and atmosphere of the area and hotel is wonderful not too touristy hotel staff were great and informative fluent in english they have the tickets for major attractions louvre eiffel etc on site so that made it easier ,1
 reception staff pleasant and helpful great location for transport facilities overall just a great hotel,1
 the rooms are too small too hot and the bathroom was cramped and didn t seem too clean ,0
 stayed for one night when i went to a concert at the o2 i think this was probably the most comfortable hotel bed i ve experienced and definitely the best pillows ever lovely shower too my room had a great view across the river and the covered walkway to the o2 was very welcome ,1
 good,1
 next to sloane road where they race and rev cars we were on 12th floor and still so loud we had to wear ear plugs and pillows over the head also the room had a serious musty smell and so we had to leave the window open pretty consistently ,0
 the bed was very comfy and loved the bathroom,1
 the rooms are very narrow we had to ask for changing the room because it was very narrow windy with an old window actually the only plus in this hotel is the location ,0
 location of the propert was fantastic and near the tube stations staff was fantastic and even the breakfast seemed over staffed rooms are modern clean and even presented a complimentary coffee as we waited for our room luxurious and well price for central london ,1
 i have booked a superior double room at grand royale what i have got was a two class single room in a bed and breakfast location called shaftesbury hyde park international this is a bed breakfast location without any comfort the room was a single not a double room not very clean so small that i was unable to open my suitcase the heating system was off and the stuff needed two hours to put on the heating system so i have booked a superior double room at grand royale london hyde park a four stars hotel what i and another couple have got was a second standard bed breakfast two stars single room in a bed breakfast location in the same street this for a proice for a four stars hotel this is an illegal practice of the hotel which should have consequences ,0
 very small old room not clean,0
 room was too small bed isn t sufficient for 2 people ,0
 newly refurbished rooms beautifully clean superb location,1
 the hotel was lovely food was fantastic bed was the most comfortable hotel bed i ve ever slept in ,1
 despite a check in time of 2pm being given we finally got into our room at 4pm this was after it taking 40 minutes to find the hotel looked like a office building no bath towels only hand towels told big towels finished what does that mean 2 of us to share 3 hand towels after a shower on the hottest day of the year is not good no air con just a desk fan that was tiny hair dryer broken could not leave the window open to get air due to sirens all night this place should not be a hotel and to charge 95 00 for the privilege is a joke not a happy customer,0
 ours was a very small and smelly room for which we paid 206 euros per night i paid the same price for a far better room elsewhere in a much better area and large clean modern room there are other bigger rooms but the building is old and badly maintained and mostly unclean everywhere the price is definitely very far from the standards of this hotel this is not a four star a two plus at most and the price should reflect that there are far better places at this price in paris there are dodgy people drinking near the entrance of the hotel at night and they even sit on its stairs sometimes the immediate vicinity is not nice the marais is close but not close enough ,0
 the hotel,0
 the breakfast was a little expensive but very plentiful the neighborhood is fantastic we especially loved the champion pub and little persia ,1
 i arrived in the afternoon and the reception area was full of people reception was a bit overwhelmed and told me it would take a while until it would be my turn to checkin so i stayed a little bit but then offered to leave my things there with them and go to the city to tour and have dinner and come back a while later which they seemed very happy about coming back around 11pm i was told they gave my room away to someone else so i had to be brought by taxi to another hotel where the staff was friendlier and could give me a room the man dealing with me at night was unbelievably unfriendly und unhelpful and didn t listen to a word i was saying 60 of my nights per month are in hotels around the world but in 9 years this is the first time this has happened to me i was very unhappy about it ,0
 the staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming the hotel decor was amazing best we have ever stopped in the room was lovely very clean and tidy ,1
 the evaluator was broken 5 days and they weren t able to fix it for a 4 star this is unforgivable where the main goal should be customer service we had every day several times to go up and down to the 4th floor ,0
 there was no one on reception and we had to wait once we alerted the bar staff that we had been standing aroundo customers personal details were left out on the reception desk for all to see including full card numbers breaching dat a privacy and pci requirements the more expensive room executive compared to the the standard twin was really tight and difficult to move around the bed left message for manager to call me still haven t heard from him altogether a very disappointing stay ,0
 no one to show you to your room no comforts in the room overall facilities were poor ,0
 the room size was smaller the bed was not comfortable overall the hotel was not more than three stars but the internet shows four stars which is overrated,0
 good location good value ,1
 everything,0
 we had a very cold room especially bahroom with not working heater with no option to make it warmer phones weren t also working in the room and we couldn t call reception we were offered different room from them which was nice touch other room was bigger but strangely even more colder and our bathroom was near the windows which were poorly isolated so we couldn t get a bath in it i am usually resistant to cold but rooms in this hotel much more colder than any other hotels in london when asked recepto to heaters in our room we were told maintaince guy looked in our room and it was okay nothing really changed and we just were to exhausted to complain about it more since we stayed there only for 1 night ,0
 filty dirty creatures in bath wardrobe sink staines everywhere bed floors sickening,0
 the location is so far noting that the hotel provides free shuttle bus the staff are not friendly beds are not really king size bed the room is so expensive for auch a hotel noting that we could find a cheaper rate within the same level of stars and actually we have found on booking very cheap rates like the hamptons aloft hotel the hotel charge you for water noting that there were no complimentary drinks the check out is at 11 am and every hour i am late i should pay 20 pounds and this os the first time i face this issue knowing that i travel a lot and have checked in to lots of hotels ,0
 the staff was not accommodating at all ignored all our requests ,0
 staff was very uncooperative we had no problem staying in a small room with kids but they forced us to get a bigger room and pay twice as much then they put us in a room where a c didn t work upon asking we were told that they couldn t do anything about it until the next day had to approach the higher ups who finally put us back in a smaller room but still charged the same double amount use this hotel as a last resort ,0
 the room was too small stuffy and dark furnitures were old and dark painted there was a door opening to the next room and all the noise was coming through the door there was no refrigerator in the room there were only two plug sockets and located in very useless spots it was a complete disappointment for its cost ,0
 facilities did not function sink was blocked something heavy fell if i had been in the room i would have been injured way overpriced for what it is ,0
 very old bed furniture tiny single beds bedding very small am not sure they are for single beds cleaning staff not friendly at all on arrival nobody takes you to the room i was in room 429 which i expected to be between rooms 428 and 430 which is not the case i asked one of the cleaners where room 429 is located and she did not assist at all she continued doing her routen i found that very unacceptable ,0
 staff really unhelpful and everything looks old inside,0
 filthy carpet wouldn t let my dog sleep on it chipped furniture no fridge peculiar linked lighting system bizzare plan of bathroom with toilet squeezed into tiny space supposed to be a deluxe room joke ,0
 during the hottest week in london since 1976 the ac was broken in a few rooms i ve checked in around 21h and no one at reception even mentioned the problem the room was an oven super hot and muggy given all the glass windows facing direct sun i ve tried to turn on the ac for a while and feeling really stupid about my inability i called reception again no mention of a problem only when a member of staff came to my room she finally said the ac has been down for some time and there was nothing she could do i showed her how extremely hot the room was for which her response was don t worry i ll speak to the manager in the morning to see what we can do clearly there was no way i could way till morning as it was impossible to sleep and i just left ,0
 the reception staff were amazing some of the best customer service have received as an extensive traveller conceige also extremely helpful at all times lovely bar and loung area location cannot be beaten for being close to hyde park and shopping excellent overall experience and value for money ,1
 at 7 30am there was no water in the bathroom second floor rooms there s insufficient water head if many guests are showering staff had experienced this previously we were given a ground floor bathroom for showing ,0
 excellent accommodation in an excellent location,1
 staff were rude talked about guests behind their backs filthy rooms with hairs on bedsheets,0
 one of the male receptionist maybe he is the manager was so rude to his coworker who was receptionist as well he was shouting at him calling him an idiot he should be well behaved infront of the customers shoudn t he soundproof will be good idea i couldnt sleep in the morning cause i could hear whatever happening in the hallway breakfast is not included will be value of money if its included wifi signal is not strong enough ,0
 great location excellent value for money ,1
 rooms clean breakfast choice great perfect location for getting around london would recommend ,1
 this hotel has ridiculously rigid procedures around payment authorisation for reservations made and paid with company credit cards i had prepaid for my stay but i was effectively charged again on my personal credit card as a deposit until the cardholder filled out a form signed it and sent it to the hotel together with a photocopy of the credit card and their passport i wasted hours in arguments the hotel manager was stand offish and rather rude which didn t help matters at all also there was very loud noise at night from tons of glass crushing while being disposed of in containers very disturbing due to the irregularity and loudness of it the continental breakfast was very poor and the english breakfast which came at a supplement was not satisfactory either poor choice and quality of the ingredients not properly cooked ,0
 rooms need updating toiletries were cheap and nasty we only had bath gel shampoo and soap not a bubble in sight had to go out and buy our own first time i ve not taken any of my own will not do it again shower pressure too slow tea coffee and milk not filled up daily when we mentioned it on checking out we were told we could of rung down to reception and they would of brought us some up this should be part of the daily routine to be filled when they have been used and not up to us to ask for them we have stayed in better accommodation for less money we payed 400 for a two night stay in mayfair it should have been an experience to remember but i m sad to say it wasn t will not be returning what genius perks didn t see any didn t have any biscuits either ,0
 very polite staff hotel location is perfect ,1
 hotel was amazing lovely and clean and i loved the sofa was very comfy to just chill out on,1
 we booked the hotel as we were going to an event at the o2 the room was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful ,1
 rooms were not as shown on pictures,0
 staff were very friendly and welcoming upon arrival the free room upgrade was excellent the hotel facilities were very good the breakfast menu choice was wide ranging and the food was cooked perfectly the location was so convenient to the inns of court the city of london and to central london ,1
 the handy phone was a nice touch ,1
 bed was very comfortable,1
 rude staff no breakfast stuff was out for us we had to ask for everything over priced tiny rooms ,0
 non smoking room smelled of cigarettes ,0
 hotel requiers an overall renovatin you will see if you go there the only benifit is the location ,0
 friendly staff very nice room ,1
 since being refurbished and changed from a holiday inn to crowne plaza it seems what were previously 2 good sized rooms have now been made into 3 cramped rooms not enough floor space to put your suitcase without having to manouevre around it all the time bed was lumpy and felt like springs were coming through probably the worst bathroom design i have ever seen the elevated shower tray has a lip of around maybe 3 mm and the shower head is positioned half behind the glass shower screen the end result is that everything gets soaking wet floor toilet toilet paper absolutely everything because it is all so close together in the small bathroom my shower flooded everything and passed through into the bedroom carpets and as a result had to change rooms staff were very helpful with this but really not the point breakfast is a standard buffet type priced at an astonishing 18 pounds per head if you buy in advance then you get vouchers and the price is discounted to 15 pounds i find it hard to believe that most people could eat 18 pounds worth of breakfast if costed at true value not good value at all and at times it seemed that certain items such as sausages were carry over from the previous day on arrival i was told that since changing to crown plaza then the free wifi no longer requires login or password what they didnt point out was that the wifi is now unsecured and as such my businness and personal applications on laptop tablet and phone would not permit me to connect kind of frustrating when you are travelling on business and wifi is important although i didnt see it my nose told me that there must be a swimming pool possibly at basement level reception smells strongly of chlorine location at best is ok but not great with a good 10 15 minutes walk to nearest tube or main station and the area certainly isnt trendy or smart and to get anywheer of interest etc involves a decent hike on foot tube etc ,0
 room reception staff,1
 bedroom quite basic but amazing reception rooms,1
 excellent breakfast next time we should include it in the package ,1
 pain a raison at breakfast was very fresh the staff were helpful explaining the gluten free menu ,1
 lovely hotel in a convenient location in the centre of london relaxing hotel bar very friendly staff very comfortable bed spacious room ,1
 was the worst visit to paris ever i had an issue about the air conditioning which was turned to heater in the property and there was no notice about this thing and complain this issue to the staff and they easily told me you can open the window if you want could wether which is not far i booked the room without this facility and know one aware me about this when i did the booking ,0
 very moody receptionist very dated decor rooms are boiling hot,0
 the room,0
 noise building site no secondary glazing bed not fit room ,0
 very beautifully decorated entrance reception breakfast room and other common areas friendly and helpful staff great location in the city center though in a quite area where you have proper rest ,1
 v pleasant stay,1
 excellent location convenient to busses trains underground close to museums hyde park comfortable bed very clean quick check in great staff ,1
 most of staf friendly,1
 first of all the room is very small there was hardly place for a bed and the bathroom was very small as well thereby it didn t look like the pictures on the site furthermore the included breakfast is poor as well we expected at least a basic english breakfast but even that was not the case also the room was quite noisy and the friendliness of the staff decreased when the night falls overall the value for money is very poor for this price one may expect a lot better ,0
 the room was beautiful the hotel was modern and very comfortable with a coffee machine in the room ,1
 this was the worst hotel i ve ever stayed in during my life the first room they gave me lower ground floor means basement was tiny dark and dingy and right by the steps from the street down to the staff entrance so the staff had a nice view of my room and me the internet connection wouldn t work in that room so next day they moved me to a room on the 2nd floor which was marginally brighter but still tiny and the day after the internet was down for the whole day a disaster as i had urgent work to do the room was noisy you could hear people in other rooms using the shower and running water the bed was seriously uncomfortable at the prices they charge it was a total disgrace how it ever got a 4 rating is way beyond me ,0
 the club room we stayed in was old and in serious need of an upgrade especially the cramped bathroom that didn t have a walk in shower i was told that only the rooms for physically challenged guests had walk in showers by far the poorest club room i ve stayed in any hotel the room service indian curry was disappointingly small and i couldn t charge it to my room despite them having my credit card there was no reasonable provision of electric sockets to charge our phones and laptops as in modern hotels it took 3 days to get a very short extension socket the aircon fan was noisy and the tv was strangely hard to turn on the club lounge was small and dingy mainly providing tea and coffee and was unstaffed when we went i was unclear if the staff were interested in the needs of their guests or just unable to help as the hotel was inadequately resourced to cap off the experience when i picked up my luggage from storage in the afternoon i couldn t open my tsa lock and it had to be broken open when paying over 200 per night your stay shouldn t be tolerated but enjoyed when you can finally find a manager they do seem service orientated but not at any staff level below that i would advise more investment training and a change of culture ,0
 unfriendly staff member and indifference in assisting us would not recommend ,0
 never recommend this hotel to anyone i am preparing to sue your site and a group of gangsters who run this hotel with my attorney ,0
 the overall atmosphere of the hotel and cleanliness ,1
 no heat no cable tv tiny room not 4 star quality would not stay again ,0
 executives club rooms were modern furnished clean and beds are comfortable ,1
 location was very nice just next to the sorbonne,1
 room was old and bed uncomfortable the room was too dark not enough lighting stayed in better hotels for cheaper ,0
 every thing was special enjoyed the swim too ,1
 absolutely brilliant lovely staff goodie bags with monopoly type mony for kids to get a drink or ice cream great breakfast buffet delicious dinner very central ,1
 great location super helpful staff really clean room,1
 toilet did not not flush inbathroom of hotelroom old dirty,0
 everything from start to finish noisy hotel booking not right rude staff that need retraining awful ,0
 we were upgraded and offered a free breakfast which was very kind when booking i had asked for a top floor room which we were given the car parking discount saved us a lot of money we found the whole experience great and will definitely be using your hotels again thank you so much ,1
 room had recently been refurbished shower was great,1
 i have never seen such a small bedroom in my entire life nor a hotel that doesn t provide any breakfast ,0
 nice place nice people it suited us perfectly ,1
 however when we got in the suite the room itself was lovely clean and spacious but the bathroom had a foul human excrement smell when we first arrived we didn t notice it to much as we were in and out it wasn t until we returned on the night 1am plus the smell has crept into the bedroom and it stunk as it was a lower ground room i can only assume all 6 floors above waste was travelling through our bathroom waste pipe we told the staff in the morning and they didn t seem to bothered well put this way not as bothered as swiping my card for payment the smell was horrendous ,0
 old ugly and need urgent updates they were charging even for wi fi ,0
 helpful staff and comfortable room ,1
 service awful bed no response to requests ,0
 good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history ,1
 the person at the check in was unpolite and it seems with no formal training in customer services i booked the room through booking com for 4 people 2 kids and requested extra bed in the reservation he argued that extra beds was not possible but they did not reject the reservation even though this was specified clearly in observations we managed to find a solution baby bed for one of my child only because a lady from the hotel appeared and tried to find a solution in the early evening the person at the reception during the first night complained when i requested wireless access 2nd time i had to explained that we were 4 adults so needed 4 connections there is no wifii only through a specific passcode per device the room was not cleaned even though we were out of the bedroom from 11am until 21 00pm never happend to me before and i am a very frequent traveller due to business ,0
 the room was so cold that i got a cold that was my main issue but the room was so tiny i live in manhattan so i am use to small space living but this was obsessively small but the lack of heat and insulation in the walls made the room an ice box causing me to get a cold please note my traveling life style probably didn t help the cold either ,0
 room very small and bathroom even smaller hotel very dingily lit and totally unwelcoming for what it is vastly overpriced avoid ,0
 wow finally time for some reviews 1 really bad staff on duty very very unhelpful 2 geoffroy rumpler front office manager delphina were two of the rudest staff we ever met throughout our europe trip 3 room had no bedroom slippers no fridge bathroom was practically empty with no facilities carpet was filthy mr rumpler our dear front office manager had the audacity to claim this is mercure s standard i would like to let you know that i applaud you for being so honest with me because you are now allowing me to tell everyone how disgusting mercure hotels are 4 delphina front desk staff was the most unwelcoming staff there 5 despite the bad stay i would like to give credit to the concierge did not take down his name for being the most helpful staff at the hotel he pushed our luggages across to the station when we were leaving and was sincerely nice i guess if you really want to stay here this is the only guy that will make your day other than that please avoid this hotel having to go through what i went through would be so sickening overall bad stay ruined our mood in paris for the price we paid i can advise you to find a better hotel avoid this mercure standard hotel ,0
 miserable receptionist bed uncomfortable room cold noisy staff outside room early morning,0
 this hotel is 2 star at best it s fraudulent to claim 4 stars the only elevator holds 3 people maximum the bar is little more than a shelf in the tiny lobby management refused to meet and explain how they can claim 4 stars shame on booking com for repeating this claim see the pictures,0
 location and nice view from the room ,1
 lost an item at the hotel and was told it was found waited for 25 mins for someone to come to tell me they haven t we stayed for 2 nights and was told there would be a sofa bed in the room as we had a 9 year old with us no bed and didn t arrange one so someone had to sleep on a chair ,0
 very comfortable room spacious bathroom excellent service great location ,1
 the room was a disgrace i got told i ll have to pay an extra 50 charge incase i decide to us the mini bar fine that s perfect until i got to the room to find out i didn t even have a minibar in there then i looked at my bank statement and i got charged 100 did i mishear something somewhere then it gets worse the light in the wardrobe didn t work let alone the huge dent that was in the bin and a nasty smell was in the shower room it smelt like a body was rotting in the drain my boyfriend and i went and complained on the first night and was told nothing could be done about the smell and that we will have the mini bar light working and a change of bin done the next day which then i come back to the hotel to see nothing was done so my boyfriend complained again and we was given free breakfast and a change of rooms bearing in mind this was our last night there was no point in changing rooms for a hotel in london i was disgraced by the low standard of my room i am very well out raged that we was even sold that room clearly it was not inspected before i arrived i personally think staying in a travellodge hotel would have been better it was a waste of money and time i ll never be coming here again nor will i be telling my friends to come here ,0
 close to paddington station friendly staff and food was good ,1
 location was good around 5 10 minutes walk to paddington railway station staff very helpful in helping to book a taxi to heathrow airport,1
 room was very small bed was very hard the indian guy working at night was borderline rude free wifi was a pain to use because you had to keep reconnecting every hour they wanted you to pay for their upgraded wifi even though they advertise free wifi ,0
 it was great location within walking distance of paddington which was a bonus with a elderly relative,1
 great view loved the room ,1
 very tired hot water took long time to work ignored by staff at check in ,0
 bathroom in room l1 unfit for purpose ,0
 location is great and deluxe room was spacious for paris standard,1
 entrance was really grand,1
 everything,0
 bed to small very uncomfortable room unappealing furniture drab and old bathroom door dirty curtains dated could really do with decorating or a refurb sofas in bar and reception area extremely low anyone with mobility or of older years would struggle to sit down and get up i know i did feels like you are sitting on floor brass handrails on entrance and doors was filthy more cleaning needed have stayed in many hotels but was disappointed at this one ,0
 excellent location and the reception staff were extremely helpful,1
 friendly staff location clean,1
 it was quite noisy in the middle of a night a man and woman fought for hours in the corridor nobody stopped them the room was cheesy and small ,0
 there was no fridge available in the room also there was no warning on the vending machine in the room stating that once you take a drink out to have a look at the label you can not put it back the wifi had to be re set often as it didn t work very well more when asked for the use of a microwave the staff in other hotels even offered a microwave in the kitchen but a staff at concord mont was not friendly also the powerpoint for electricity was not near the bed side table ,0
 location,0
 close to paddington station shops and restaurants easy to get to staff are very pleasent nice size room with bathroom and tv ,1
 very small room with extremely limited facilities and grossly overpriced for what it offers 178 per room per night breakfast not included surely this cannot be ranked as a 4 star hotel complete disappointment in comparison to other best western hotels i have stayed in with a similar ranking never again ,0
 room tidiness cracked floor no sound isolation poor furniture,0
 staff at the bar were very friendly,1
 what you pay with what you get tiny room unconfortable bed cheap facilities,0
 awesome old building,1
 all pretty standard free phone toiletteries and fruit bowl two minute walk from car park and tube station ,1
 efficient friendly staff ,1
 breakfast is expensive so when you have limited time in the morning and you have finished your breakfast before being offered coffee you feel short changed ,0

 staff were excellent mentioned on booking that we were there to celebrate my mother s 60th birthday and the staff upgraded her room put a bottle of wine and a card and wrote a birthday message on the window my mother was delighted and this is the kind of thing that customer service is all about going the extra all of the staff we came across were helpful friendly and knowledgeable special thanks to elizabetta on reception and marta in the bar they re the only names i remember and i hope i got them right room was a very good size plenty of facilities provided including a microwave and crockery ,1
 refurbishment going on that we were not informed about when booking drilling right next to our room at 9am not great,0
 lovely staff restaurant and facilities would definitely make this my first choice for my next visit to london ,1
 the room was very comfortable and well appointed we also got a very good deal on price ,1
 site description of hotel was exagerated very poor value for the price paid ,0
 room service cleanliness,1
 the noise that we experienced of a night lost lots of sleep i will not be staying at this hotel again ,0
 the atmosfer at the hotel is very good location near is excellent close to all activity,1
 cozy room clean excellent location,1
 the room too small u can t move the cover of the bed was dirty,0
 terribly over priced zero charm badly in need of renovation and super stuffy without the a c on we didn t like the hotel at all and would not recommend it to anyone bathroom in particular was in bad shape the toilet took 10 min to re fill after a flush ,0
 sleepy run down hotel worst value for money,0
 the facilities in both the hotel and room were second to none and the views from our room and 18th floor bar were amazing as we were seeing a show in the o2 it was the perfect location for us ,1
 lovely area and rooms were modern with amazing shower ,1
 very peaceful and quiet would not believe you were so close to the main roads staff extremely friendly helpful everything was spotless and clean rubber duck is a great gimmick children loved taking him on our travels and taking pictures ,1
 the staff were amazing and nothing was any problem,1
 rooms were in a shabby and very run down state beds were basic and bathroom barely adequate this hotel has plummeted in standard in the last 15 years when we stayed here last it was the hilton mews and it was a very high standard small hotel small is fine when quality is good the breakfast was most disappointing a very basic one star buffet with poor quality food when i last stayed here a very high quality english breakfast was served from the kitchen i don t mind a buffet if it is a high standard but this was rubbish ,0
 having to pay for the use of the pool when i am a staying at the hotel terrible having to wait a long time to check in and out very poor and slow service,0
 poor service and badly maintained hotel this hotel needs big time renovation telephone does not work staff at the breakfast talking between them louder than the customers etc never again ,0
 location clean staff friendly ,1
 everything about our stay was wonderful i had mentioned that it was my daughters birthday and there were wine and champagne in the room which had also been upgraded it really was a great experiance,1
 the staff were excellent on check in and out gabrielle was very friendly and helpful,1
 the room carpet was dirty i dropped a tie and looked under the bed and was met with a thick layer of dust the air conditioning didnt work so a mobile untit was positioned in the corner an air pipe led from the air con to an open window 1 the noise of the adjoining street was heard and rhe mobile unit was uncomfortably loud the doors were scratched whick matched the state of the decor the bathroom was clean though the towels were mean and thin breakfast is not worth the money do not be talked into it it looks good but is poor using booking com i got a great rate booked some monthes in advance sadly that cheap rate which was not the ceapest room they offered also met that i did not get a decent room pay less and dont stay here go and boom somewhere a little further away ,0
 very very good staffs they did great job,1
 the rooms are far too small and very little soundproofing sadly you could hear the person next door snoring toilets flushing walking around and tv i would not recommend this hotel or staying in this run down area of paris,0
 my money and makeup are in the room stolen by their cleaning staff but the hotel refused to responsible the attitude is very poor,0
 air conditioning in room not working resulting in terrible nights sleep with open windows disgusting state of camp bed mattress for my son only one towel put out for family of three no character of the building retained in the decor too modern,0
 friendly staff comfortable room features ,1
 as per the review title this is an oasis in london the calm and quiet starts just yards from the strand very friendly and helpful staff might seem expensive but you get what you pay for ,1
 staff not following thing through staff were clearly struggling with the most mundane of tasks,0
 our room was very cold even with the heating turned right up it was freezing we were at the front of the building as well so it was very noisy through the night with the traffic as we were working at olympia for a show on the second night we were out for networking drinks and by the time we got back to the hotel we were wanting to order food we got told due to the time this had to be done from our room and we only had an option of sandwiches and pizza when we tried to call it went to voicemail i ask the bar staff if i could order it there and deliver to our room and she said no i went down to reception and the lady was not helpful at all she looked very confused with the whole matter finally i called reception from my room phone and got the food delivered but to be honest the bread on the sandwiches were stale and it was just awful unfortunately we are staying with you again in september for another show as this is already booked i can only hope that our experience is somewhat better ,0
 location is perfect ,1
 bed comfy staff friendly nice bathroom nice area near hyde park i like hearing about the history of the hotel especially about how it was built for lily langtry the king s mistress and well known actress ,1
 room was not ready for 2pm one of the pillow was dirty and on breakfast i found a moldy bread i show that to member of staff and she did not even said sorry to me she just took a bread and replaced whole tray ,0
 friendly staff great location quiet area in busy london,1
 bed by the window staff was accomodating safe near shopping and cafes,1
 by far the worst hotel i ve been to in ages mind i am in a different one every week things just don t work staff contradict each other on several occasions for me food is below all standards except the indian restaurant that one is decent there are all sorts of weird hacks like paper ticket vouchers for breakfast in the 21st century and a clamped paper jacket for your magnetic keycard that gets stamped with a red or black stamp to indicate whether your card was preauthorised just look at the irony of that an exchange office that they claim they have but can t exchange 40 on the grounds that they do not have that amount of cash yet then suddenly can when you ask if they are having a laugh and then claim they can t provide you with a receipt for that transaction until you repeat the question about having a laugh when they suddenly can the evening receptionist telling you you can sort everything out upon check out at 4 30am yet the night one next morning insisting it s impossible to charge you and print an invoice until you have a severe fall out and then suddenly everything is possible this booking for an extra day had to be done online because upon my arrival according to the reception they do not do bookings in the hotel i wonder what would have happened if i insisted they did i d booked it immediately upon my arrival and was told everything was settled only to be literally thrown out of my room and told i had to check in again on the last day unfortunately all of that sums up into a strong and lasting impression resembling a cheap sharm el sheikh holiday facility rather than a canary wharf establishment charging 100 quid a night for the room alone ,0
 the helpful smiling staff ,1
 room with a view beautiful ,1
 not sure if room had been cleaned to 100 as found something under my bed and left on the bedside table not even sure what it was couldn t open a window don t do chips for breakfast but that s everyone s choice i suppose ,0
 staff were very friendly and helpful room was very clean and great view across london shower was excellent bar had a good atmosphere and a very pleasant seating area ,1
 i loved the friendliness of the staff and their can do attitude,1
 this was our fourth stay here never regret staying here excellent hotel nice rooms great location for westend theatres very helpful and friendly staff quiet and bonus views over london,1

 service mattress location,1
 comfy bed lovely breakfast,1
 wonderfully comfortable bed and excellent shower,1
 i fail to see how this is a 4 hotel the room was cramped big cracks in the sick carpets stained and shredded chairs in the dining room were stained and dirty whilst there we were also not advised that construction work would be starting in the next room at 8am monday morning which we were not pleased with all in all this was a complete nightmare stay and frankly not worth the money we paid we will not be staying here again absolutely shocking hotel ,0
 smallest room ever seen and we got an upgrade pre authorisation of 396 taken 3 days prior to our visit and not released until two days after check out disgusting,0
 personel reception,1
 the shower was blocked and room was very damp,0
 very friendly staff,1

 staff aren t welcoming don t cnsider regualar customers and loyal visiters room isn t comfy enouph leeking was experienced in a room ,0
 the entire hotel is under a full refurbishment ,0
 aggressive manager woman who shouted at me as i complained about my microscopic bedroom window very difficult to open another member of the staff told me several rooms had problematic windows as the place is very old the bathroom was chilly with cracked window and no drawers at all anywhere neither safe where to store my clothes luggage and belongings one evening i came back to find out one of the towels was all stained in black the woman in question kept saying all the time that it was a georgian house to answer my complaints concerning the broken windows and the lack of any comfort in this third floor no lift microscopic bedroom i am often in london and this is the worst place i have been so far never again ,0
 location is too far room without window dirty bathroom no fridge,0
 everything,1
 the staff were friendly and helpful the location s amazing so near bayswater station and central to everything around the area very strategic also amazing decor in the hotel itself ,1
 the service was really good nice and helpful staff i could even weight my luggage before leaving the hotel and re arrange it the hotel is clean good location for my professional needs many restaurants pubs and shops around good connection with the center gym a bit small but with the necessary equipment when i used it it was not crowded so just what you need ,1
 the bed was to small the television was on the wrong wall the bath did not fill up as the plug did not go in properly ,0
 room basic no tea making facilities a must for me decor needs upgrading,0
 dirty room coffee beans had been spilt all over the floor and cushions which stained my clothes and the bedsheets they offered no help whatsoever shower tempterature kept changing which burnt me twice ,0
 decor,1
 unhelpful staff and inflexible shuttle service to train not reliable adjacent restaurant forgetful with orders it seemed to me that the paying customer was a bit of a nuisance the immediate surrounds including entry were dirty litter on floor chair in lounge had same dirty tissue on it for three days it is in a good spot but poorly managed ,0
 property is badly managed the carpets are old and awfully smelly service is pathetic breakfast spread not great ,0
 it is a spacious hotel and generlly clean it has a good bar the concierge is good ,1
 the service was really terrible the staff weren t friendly we wanted to upgrade beds but they wouldn t help us despite the fact that we were willing to pay more manager was very rude i will not be coming back to this hotel nor will i recommend it ,0

 perfect location with stylish quirky decoration ,1
 too many dislikes to mention won t be going back,0
 location only a short walk to apollo and underground station,1
 room was to single bed for husband and i not happy fr,0
 excellent location and fantastic rooms,1
 if tripadvisor allowed 0 stars then this hotel would receive it i arrived to check in official time 14 00 at 17 05 to be told my room was not ready no apology and in fact if anything it was made to feel like it was my fault for turning up there were four staff on reception all muttering between them and all who behaved appallingly they were rude unapologetic and even contradicted themselves something another guest behind me at check in stepped in to re enforce as they clearly were also appalled at the way i was spoken to after waiting 30minutes for my room it left me with just 35minutes to get ready for a black tie event i was attending not what i had planned to top it off i was provided with a downgrade to the room i had booked and the room had stains on the carpet and scratched furniture and bathroom the shower handle was glued in place and would only stay on boiling hot it was totally difficult to have a comfortable shower my view was overlooking a dirty roof and a dirty street the night porter was helpful to start with and we ordered food on our return but after waiting over 30minutes for a soda water and a ciabatta bread we spoke to reception and cancelled the order only to have the night porter banging on my door at 2am in the morning telling me he knew i was in there as a female i did not feel safe in the hotel and would not recommend to anyone i worked in travel for years and now work in customer service and would imagine the staff at this hotel have received training in neither the recent five star reviews must be the staff themselves or their friends and we spoke to several other people at the hotel and everyone had something negative to say it was really dissspoainting and the worst part was that they were so defensive and no one would acknowledge how badly we had been treated ,0
 booked and paid for a twin deluxe room they gave me a broom cupboard with a very small double bed which i had to share with my teenage son ,0
 expensive drinks and claustrophobic windowless lounge,0
 beautiful building and charming staff excellent breakfast ,1
 the hotel offered a free smartphone in every room that you could take out around the city ideal for looking up places to eat find your way on google maps or call to make a reservation ,1
 didn t like staff at all specially concierge ,0
 the view of the train station which my son loved the most he loves trains ,1
 staff couldnt do enough for you fantastic breakfast very clean perfect for an overnight or short break ,1
 the smallest room i ve ever been in ,0
 the room was amazing but it was the staff on the door and at reception that made all the difference very friendly happy and the hotel itself is magnificent,1
 staff specially the receptionist miss dolma is amazing and really professional in being rude and providing assistance to its customer the property is rather very much into making money other than putting customer s satisfaction as their priority for assistance i did call boooking com 24 7 hotline but there is no one to assist during night your call be go on waiting for next one hour my main concern has been with booking com then the property directly let me tell you i have been very very active booking com customer but am really disappointed with them ,0
 tired slightly smelly hotel that is well past it s best phones didn t work windows didn t open air con didn t work hot and airless bed was old and uncomfortable plug socket had black burn marks no tea bags and with all this they still wouldn t offer wifi without additional payment worst hotel we have ever stayed at very bad value at 140,0
 1 the smallest room i ve ever seen in my life you cannot move in the room there is no space to keep you bag 2 a lot of noise,0
 when i arrived the only rooms they offered were 1 smoking couldn t take as i have asthma or 2 room with no window i have claustrophobia so this was disastrous but had no choice then in the morning the fire alarm went off took the fire exit route junk in all the stairwells no exit to the street came into the restaurant and lobby finally able to ask the front desk who said the alarm was a mistake but no one went to tell the poor people standing around in their jams ,0
 everything in the room was nice and comfortable ,1

 the hotel room was tiny not compact it had a draughty window which was freezing at night the pillows were hard and the rooms very noisy during the early hours hearing people banging about plus the kettle was broken the breakfast was ok avoid the scrambled eggs and coffee and make sure they don t try to charge you twice the service could do with work we waited a very long time for 2 drinks ,0
 rude staff tiny rooms tasteless breakfast ,0

 bed bugs in many rooms broken furniture unfriendly and not helpful staff very bad overall experience for the whole group,0

 the room was too small stuffy and dark furnitures were old and dark painted there was a door opening to the next room and all the noise was coming through the door there was no refrigerator in the room there were only two plug sockets and located in very useless spots it was a complete disappointment for its cost ,0
 got a room in a lower category as booked after getting back to staff i received discount it was disappointing as i expected a comfy spacious room which was no more available room not as expected and very small avoid ground floor or basement ,0
 location new ,1
 room wifi does not work well plus extra 10 per day street noisy poor wind quality room was cold could not adjust the temperature ,0
 every thing,0

 overall staff were excellent quality of food was superior to most hotel restaurants with good price points wraps etc freshly prepared so able to accommodate changes room service curry very good handy phone was an unexpected bonus as it included free calls to the usa allowing me to resolve issues with at t not properly applying international adjustments room had excellent soundproofing and air conditioning especially in this heat wave bed very comfortable and bedding great reception staff very helpful graciously coordinated an early check in shower was awesome with superb water pressure and nice no water shortage compared to us so no need to recycle towels etc house keeping did a great job too the door staff could not do enough to assist guests very attentive and friendly ,1

 the staff were very helpful at all times there are also about 4 good restaurants within 5 minutes walk from the hotel cleanliness i must say is about 99 super clean toilets shower etc,1
 we were conned out of a family room and had to pay more money it was the anniversary of our daughters heart operation and you ruined it many thanks,0
 i bought this trip for my son he was asked for a 50 deposit which he had no problem paying in cash as he s 18 years old and does not have credit cards they wouldn t except his cash and where not going to let him stay he had to phone me in spain and luckily i had the card with me basically this was his first trip for him and his girlfriend to london and they felt frightened as they didn t think they could stay as it took awhile to contact me so no i wouldn t recommend this hotel,0
 the mattress needs to be updated ,0
 i was given a room with no window dump ,0
 the first room offered was appalling,0
 second stay here and never disappoints staff are excellent rooms are fantastic comfortable beds and great selection for brekkie fabulous location for the o2 ,1

 got an upgrade on 9th floor very comfortable modern room ,1
 beautifully appointed and well situated,1
 staff were not helpful room was not ready when we arrived when we were eventually shown the room they had not added the extra bed when the bed arrived the mattress had very bad staining when we checked out the following morning the manager said he would contact us regarding our unsatisfactory stay but never did would never use this hotel ever again even if it was free ,0
 since i travel to paris at least 6 times a year for work i booked as a single traveller a double room since i have terror of paris hotel single rooms the room i was given was tiny and not more than 11 square meter in their booking page they claim a room size of 16 square meter when i complained they told me straight into my face that i was wrong and that the room size was exactly as on the web no change of rate or at least a free breakfast was offered to compensate hospitality of the lowest category so i paid for a double room got a small single room with a tiny bathroom where they had to fix the sink outside because it did not fit into the bath i feel cheated the money of course was deducted before my arrival first two pictures are the room i got and the third picture is from their booking com site for exactly the same room category i booked,0
 it s old run down hotel i don t suggest it for a family facilities are not great ,0
 zero client focus staff having no can do attitude worst place ever i have been to in london ,0
 customer service,0
 excellent location and staff very helpful ,1
 rooms were extremely small en suite had a lot to be desired ,0
 everything ,1
 got to the hotel and they had over booked offered me a room in an alternative location that was useless for my ongoing work trip the following day declined to stay so no idea what the hotel was like but i don t expect to book a room to find it isn t available i will stick with booking direct with hotels i know and chains in future ,0
 upon booking this trip i informed them it would be for my girlfriends birthday they agreed to provide some welcome drinks which was very kind however we never received them i also asked for a room with a nice view they said they would accommodate for that also again we didn t receive that we were given a room with no bath and a disabled shower and toilet the room was poorly decorated and very gloomy the breakfast which i paid an extra 50 for was average at best the english muffins were stale and the full english breakfast was mostly stringy fatty pieces of bacon with no other real variety of extras also the 50 gives you a 30 spend per person which we fell 6 under as our bill came to 54 the hotel then tried to charge us 14 for going over our allowance which wasn t possible also before informing you how breakfast works they pour you a glass of 4 50 freshly squeezed out a bottle orange juice all in all this was a horrendous stay and i wouldn t recommend this hotel ,0
 the room smelled of sewage the area is scary at night 30 min metro ride to the center extremely high prices poor value to money,0
 poorly furnished room poor tv poor shower 4 single beds pushed in when i ordered a double room,0
 first room we were offered was morelike a single fortunately manager agreed to move us staff in restaurant did not have very good english food orders were incorrect as result breakfast was expensive for what was available decor was shabby not usual mal standard,0
 grubby dirty tired dusty 40 minutes to check in and staff who didn t know what they were doing so dissatisfied will be writing to head office for full refund they could only offer partial refund at the hotel ,0
 location was superb overlooking oosterpark nice and quiet away from the city centre tram stops very close by and metro not far away ,1
 the room solely had a window to the indoor pool area hardly any natural ligh a bit at least from the glas roof above the pool from the pool there was an extreme smell of cloride in the room and you could obviouls not get any fresh air upon request the room could also not be changed very poor value ,0
 location and feel of the hotel,1
 the staff were not helpful upon arrival when my 22 year old son and i arrived to find we were sharing a small bed together after booking online i realise this might have been my fault although i thought i had booked 2 x single beds they were not helpful in resolving this smoothly and quickly instead focast on charging an extra 40 to 60 gbp we were not impressed and in my 15 years of travel have never experienced this normally if there are issues on arrival the staff are more than happy to accomodate and move people to assist with their requests this was certainly not the case ,0
 when booking i requested a quiet room and i got one right next to the lift which was very noisy all night my duvet had no duvet cover on it just a sheet the kettle and air con were broken the hotel was full of functions and weddings so you felt like you were staying in a conference centre i complained about the room and they took the cost of my breakfast off the bill but given i only had toast it wasn t really worth it i definitely wouldn t stay there again ,0
 bed was very uncomfortable,0
 position and breakfast,1
 spacious room with stunning view to the shard ,1
 all excellent great staff amazing location comfortable and clean room creative design it s highly recommended ,1
 this was the first time my husband and i stayed at the hotel it was an excellent experience and we would definitely stay again ,1
 close to everything,1
 very clean room and comfortable bed good wifi everywhere except in breakfast place the hotel is close to some major museums and attractions like louvre and noterdam and other smaller ones the hotel is very warm in winter and has a very beautiful cheminee in the lobby very calm room that you don t hear any noises neither form inside nor outside of the hotel ,1
 the stay was very nice staff is also friendly breakfast is also good loved the hotel ,1
 location was good,1
 good facilities friendly staff good breakfast,1
 mattress on the bed was dreadful it was not comfortable at all room was too hot couldn t open the windows just couldn t cool the room at all the room itself was very shabby breakfast was very basic ,0
 1 they charged us my mistake twice the receptionist kept telling us it s not her fault and after that they apologized with cookies but didn t fix their mistake and our money is still bending 2 the fire alarm rang at 7 a m and we ran downstairs to a false alarm they apologized by saying at least we know that the fire alarm is working 3 rooms are uncomfortable no tissues in the room nor pins imagine that the bed is too small and the bathroom is the worst the room is totally uncomfortable we thought of changing the hotel so many times,0
 room very spacious and bed was one of the best i have ever slept in attending an event at the o2 so perfect location andrei was superb on reception great attitude and very friendly ,1
 room was spacious and clean and quiet no noise late at night ,1
 the decor was horrendous and the staff were rue very overpriced,0
 the location was perfect for the new year celebration,1
 smelly noisy room,0
 too much to type out,0
 i booked online for my parents and called the hotel with a couple of requests the receptionist was very helpful and professional the booking and payment went very smoothly my parents said that they loved the hotel and that the room was very nice they also loved the breakfast and booked it for the entire stay ,1
 the staff were very helpful and accomodating ,1
 on arrival all signs were good we were greeted warmly by one member of staff who handed us over to another member of staff that s where the niceties ended when being checked in we were not spoken to the whole process took about 10 15 minutes and the woman who checked us in did not explain anything we were signing or why they needed other information it was lucky we were taken to our room because we definitely wouldn t have found it on our own when we opened the door to say we were disappointed was an understatement the room was so small there was no where to put our small suitcase the bed was not a standard double and was totally unsuitable for two adults the length was uncomfortable for my partner who is under 6ft the bed was shoved against the window which meant that the window could not really be opened the air con was loud or we suffered the heat checking out took a long time we were pleased to see the back of the hotel we certainly would not stay again ,0
 poor service and welcome on reception un organised no on site parking dispite being advertised no mini bar in rooms when it was also advertised the hotel took our payments for the rooms twice and were not apologetic when we rang to complain staff unhelpful and un informative beds uncomfortable and also kept moving apart during the night ,0
 good location ,1
 great location great service,1
 large bath tub beds were comfy and staff were really friendly,1
 comfortable room and bathroom,1
 staff were excellent and always ready to help food tasted like it had been cooked and not warmed up like so many hotels plus you do not wait long in the restaurants because there are staff everywhere beds are comfortable even for sore bones and are very large rooms and bathrooms are excellent location for the o2 cannot be bettered it s outside the back door however if going elsewhere tube not far away perhaps 5 minutes walk so very good for central london very quiet no main roads going past so no traffic noise at night ,1
 the bedroom did not reflect what the website shows it had a strong smell of synthetic cleaners the staff were pleasent but seemed preoccupied i certainly would not revisit ,0
 do not go to this hotel had a dreadful stay staff very unhelpful rude as to top it off my girlfriend was spiked didn t even get to stay in the hotel for that reason was at the hospital hotel does not want to do anything about it vial vermin ,0
 we liked the location right in the heart of everything whether it s trafalgar square national gallery soho or piccadilly the cleanliness space of the room it was really big with big very comfortable beds the breakfast good the staff polite helpful my 83 year old mother especially liked the little services in the room e g the personal welcoming note the 6 pm tradition that the maid had to come to recheck the room get the bed ready for her sleep the interior ground floor was wonderfully designed to show a blend of the old world and the avant garde the library was cozy and fitting for a nice reading time ,1
 we found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in london in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked 7 months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds upgrading to a club room provided us with a lounge area on the 5th floor which was very nice as the rooms are small the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean the location is excellent the hotel is within a 5 minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores the staff was very friendly and helpful ,1
 the wifi was terrible the food was diabolical don t order from the restaurant and certainly bother with the worse breakfast i have ever come across over 20 years of travelling,0
 the rooms and view were fantastic the staff were very helpful getting to our concert from hotel was relaxing and not at all stressful ,1
 food service was very poor took so long to take order we had to leave and eat elsewhere they didn t take our order breakfast is far better at a premier inn bed was like a rock slept poorly for some reason it took a lifetime to check in i have no idea why ,0
 excellent breakfast,1
 quaint lounge bar excellent location ,1
 the cleanliness of the plates cups etc the staff trying to charge twice for breakfast the rudeness of reception staff the fact there was a prom on right next to our room terrible experience ,0
 style location relaxing ,1
 good location quiet spot near good restaurants and close to metro friendly staff very helpful ,1
 we stayed 1 night as we went to see bruno mars at the o2 they allowed us to park in there car park and stay all day the next day as we was getting the underground into london and the parking only cost 24 if u pay at the machine it costs 50 also i liked the fact you can order room service 24 7,1
 the staff was not friendly at all they didnt help us with any of our questions there was a reno job going on in our hallway which was so noisy it is disrespectful to do a reno job early in the morning when people are sleeping this hotel is in a secluded area which does not give a good vibe please avoid staying here ,0
 the room is for sleeping only e g the tv can only be watched from the bed poor uk tv channel choice ,0
 extra small room not enough space for a baby cot suitcases and the stroller the ac kept dropping the temperature at night plus they charged us double very bad ,0
 hotel particularly our room in desperate need of a refurbishment very very tired looking hotel tired looking room and bathroom was advertised as being discounted from 800 night like they say if it looks to good to be true it usually is ,0
 i am a regular customer of this hotel however this time i was very dissapointed as i asked for an extention and the receptionist said that the room is booked and he can not make an extention i found out later that this was a lie i left my mobile phone charger in the room and came back at 6 pm to ask for it the room was not occupied yet and someone has went to search for it and came back with nothing this absulotely unacceptable i will not stay in this hotel in the future ,0
 lovely location for visiting london ,1
 room was not even ready when checking in it was dirty and i checkin late so no excuses the booking of the hotel is also painful and still waiting for refund of reservation ,0
 love what staff done to our room thankyou,1
 the staffs attitude the cleanliness found nail clippings on the floor by the bed and also a dirty extension lead that was left in there by a guest before health and safety plug socket loose on the wall ,0
 when i registered the hotel in easy book as the owner of hotel also has other lower hotel he accepted is onlinr but when we arrived he eanted to changes our hotel and as i choose this for location it s really upset me and it seems that offer is telling to every customer in high seasons ,0
 friendly staff comfortable bed ,1
 great selection at breakfast extra comfortable beds and linen great price through booking com,1
 tired property in desperate need of renovation staff without motivation and without any idea of customer service would prefer to sit a chat between themselves rather than check customers in breakfast awful should have gone to pret to get considerably better at a quarter of the price i stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and it has gone down hill terribly a hotel to be avoided ,0
 location was very good for hyde park and shops,1
 the cleaning of the room was not up to the standard of such hotel stars ,0
 upon checkout the reception told me no need for checkout and they will send me the bill later no bill was sent and i was charged around 200 more than the fee though i didn t have any room service ,0
 the room and homely feeling of the hotel,1
 every think,0

 cafe in russell square park just over the road serving breakfast at a fraction of the price and in a nice setting ,1
 bedlinen was poor quality beds were uncomfortable their is no real social space the bar restaurant was suitable for back packers not business people ,0
 the hotel is dated the condition of the common areas is poor the carpet are worn stained and dirty the carpet in the rooms are in a similar condition on the day night of my stay there was no hot water and no effort was made to inform guest of this problem the air conditioning unit in my room was not working and requires a service i have stayed in the hotel on a number of occasions over the past 24 months i have noticed a gradual detrrioration of the rooms and common areas over this time it is not value for money any more ,0
 the rooms were basic and out of date it s unbelievable that i have stayed in nicer travel lodges the temperature was sweltering there was no air conditioning and all they had was a little fan in the cupboard i payed a lot of money for my room and expected more from a hotel located on the strand ,0
 the room was excellent with a very large and comfortable bed the bathroom was faultless too as everything in the hotel ,1
 i found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful and it was very good value,1
 the hotel is literally falling apart ,0
 too noisy and the bed is not comfortable,0
 staff were excellent and the hotel is beautiful ,1
 staff were friendly beds were comfortable and clean,1
 don t expect the personnel except the concierge to smile or be helpful the bathroom is tiny the noise of the underground ensures that you don t fall asleep before midnight and wake up a few hours later we managed to change bedroom but only after long negotiations this hotel has no soul ,0
 close to o2 problem with shower door was fixed promptly comfortable bed bathroom sparkling reception staff friendly and helpful ,1
 close to british museum and tube station i also like the interior decoration enough sockets for all my devices to charge at the same time ,1
 the room was very run down there was a pull out bed and we had twin beds even though we booked a double we were fobbed off with an excuse that they upgraded us to a bigger room did the bigger room i want just a decent bed the carpet was disgusting and had cigarette burns in it the room smelled like smoke we struggled to sleep and their solution was to mask it with air freshener to make it even worse ,0
 this hotel staff was unfriendly miss leading had pay for parking front desk did not have key for car park being charged 2 x for a room crazy call hotel soon as arrive back to toronto would not recommend this hotel ,0
 the staff was so kind and available,1
 lovely building and very good location i paid for a superior room but it was more like a standard will visit again though building has great character staff were helpful and accommodating ,1
 clean room plus empty the bins,0
 nice little extras wine chocolates and fruit friendly staff mostly ,1
 reception and restaurant ghastly ,0
 location wasnt convenient as there were construction work near the hotel and we had make a big detour the furniture were old and the place obviously needed refurbishment ,0
 breakfast was good,1
 small halls,0
 i was shocked with the reservation manager s attitude he told me to treat him well and then he can treat me well and help me the issue is about our 2 5years old daughter could not stay with us even not asked for a baby cot after i shared my disappointment about it they discussed and he told me that we could stay together but told us that we had breakfast for two only so my little daughter could not this is the most strangest thing i have ever faced in my life after being asked that i have to treat him well and its a prerequisite for us to get help from them is exactly is a threatining thing so strongly not recommended and please be careful with the reservation manager because he was so close to attack me following his threatining sentences ,0
 clean room great choice at breakfast staff were soooo helpful nothing was a problem,1
 all staff friendly and extremely helpful,1
 being awoken at 7am in the morning by the window cleaner who thought it was acceptable to tap the window with his equipment for over 25 minutes i raised this with the reception desk later in the morning and was told that luckily the window cleaner comes only once or twice a month so this shouldn t be an issue tomorrow the staff seemed to just accept that i d had a very rude awakening when checking out after two nights i was again asked about my stay and i brought up the issue with the window cleaner again and for a second time the staff seemed completely unconcerned for my discomfort i guess they d already taken my money so they were happy ,0
 price breakfast cleaning space,0
 i didn t like the service at all the enter the room without my permission and switch on all the lights and ask me to check out as i have to chech out in another day it was so bad i didn t like it at all,0
 i did not even get to visit the hotel as i only realised today i booked the wrong dates called the hotel said to speak to booking com as i booked it on the 11th for 27th november but looking at the booking was for 22nd nov called booking com and spoke to natalie she called the hotel and said they cant do anything as passed the date i feel that is wrong when someone clearly never visited the hotel why would you charge them 153 00 ,0
 location and views from the rooms we had were good,1
 room smelt of sick when we arrived the pillows had not been replaced i would not recommend a hotel where the cleaners do not replace pillows covered on sick and the manager offers no apology despite asking to speak to him her ,0
 not 4 star rude,0
 staff was impolite not friendly ,0
 breakfast was excellent one of the best i have ever had in a hotel staff were lovely we had a problem with the safe in our room and this was rectified very promptly ,1
 i came to meet up with my two sisters we had a great time finding the rooms very comfortable even just to sit around to chat in we ate in the hotel food was good service great it was all we expected it to be great couple of days ,1
 good amenities in the room ,1
 it is an old crumbling place ragged carpets dirty and the room was extremely hot and poorly ventilated the place could do with a renovation ,0
 the price was too much for the standard of the hotel the bed was very hard and uncomfortable breakfast was ok bacon was like rubber overall not impressed,0
 never saw an hotel of 350 euro with no laundry bag the room was really too small the bathroom was so small that if i opened the door i could not use the washbasin the room floor was not very clean and the furnishings really poor for such a price ,0
 the staff at the front desk were not smiling at all except for the ladies at the bar,0
 room was extra small and the bad was also extra small after first night they changed my room but that one was also very small i think far a way not as confortable as a five star hotel staff wasn t very kind always was a lot of guys at the reception but nobady said hello i think is a big trap no money return ,0
 there is no loopy just a reception also you can t use that one elevator more than 4 persons their rooms are very small with smallest refrigerator don t try to eat your breakfast at this hotel ,0

 bathroom tv chanle all the room old and the bath room old meed to renew,0

 every thing,0
 everything except requested twin room,1
 this is not a 4 star hotel it has to be down graded to a 2 star or less room was not cleaned on one of the days the saturday i was leaving all staff turned up to work late except for the cleaning breakfast was late checking out was late because there was no one there,0
 all the staff were very helpful it was a last minute booking as we stranded due to storm doris,1
 shabby decor rooms are painted white on what looks like 70 s woodchip wallpaper the tacky plastic flowers planted at the main entrance should of been our 1st clue poor quality of bedding with wafer thin pillows possibly the cheapest toilet paper i ve ever experienced in a hotel of this price range very noisy even for london we were woken at 7 30am on a sunday morning by staff wheeling trolleys full of what sounded like glassware we were on the 4th floor followed soon after by regular chambermaid trolleys rolling up and down the corridor with clunky wheels the sound between rooms is also easily audible staff look bored and the bar staff give you the feeling that they re waiting for a better job to come along to whisk them away when i did comment about the issues i had at the front desk it was met with an oh well shrug of the shoulders and hasty preparation of my bill i ve had better stays in premier inns and for 200 a night i would seriously look elsewhere ,0
 the room is very old not nice should not be helton name ,0
 dingy rooms even the business class rooms were too compact for any comfort the room service was horrible bath rooms were gloomy and dark poor lighting properly bath water was not draining complimentary drinking water had to be demanded the management put whole blame on senior management ,0
 i ate at the bar restaurant food was overly priced and horrible skip the fish chips all together the staff was very friendly and helpful and always eager to assist the rooms were small and cold only thing they had were sheets and no comforters to keep us warm throughout the night the heat barely worked and the rooms are really small for the price i chose to rent an apartment for our last night in london just so we could spread out and have some room ,1
 the building looks horrible from the outside the room was very small and when i woke up in the morning i saw mould in the window ,0
 cleaning lady rushing into the room when i arrived to add a bottle of water when i asked why she was rushing in she could not answer as she did not speak english and did not understand me room was too hot during the night a lot of noise from outside and the corridor i did not have a good sleep at all bed not comfortable room 309 was not at a higher level as requested carpet on the floor was a disadvantage for my allergies cleaning lady knocked on my door at 8 15 am again without any explanation ,0
 the door to the toilet is opaque that is ludicrous as you can see the silhouette of the person using the toilet old awful hotel from the reception area to the rooms will never stay or recommend this place again,0
 the room was comfortable clean and the staff was friendly ,1
 clean room and quite,1
 they breakfast was too bad and not worth it the value you pay,0
 old hotel and not worth the money,0
 worst nights sleep ive ever had in a hotel beds rock hard staff wernt bothered room was extremely dusty and likr a broom cupboard ,0
 just take a look at the photos i am a h honours member and this should not be allowed they should be listed as a hostel no disrespect to hostels i tried to complain and was offered an upgrade on my next stay the temptation of some h honours bonus points don t make me laugh don t stay its not nice and a health hazard,0
 this was undergoing renovations which i was not told about this included concrete dust from the build everywhere in the air black dirty dust sheets up lights out in the hallway next to my room ,0
 the charme of the hotel the staff the breakfast the location close to hyde park,1
 the cold the place was freezing the room was freezing the bar area was freezing generally a cold sprited hotel wouldn t recommend and most defo won t be returning,0
 we are usually traveling to paris 2 3 times a year for business and leisure we have stayed in much smaller hotels typical of paris too but our stay at warwick was our worst ever stay in the last 18 years the name is too big for this hotel with zero standard we were in a deluxe room with extremely dirty curtains walls and bathroom the curtain walls and ceiling had dirt marks of insect killed on them that were not removed the phones in the room were not working the pop up blockers in bathtub and wash basin could not be opened but to be removed on 4th night my wife was screaming of seeing a coackroach in the bathroom we complained about hygiene and poor condition of room the next morning in the afternoon we noticed the cleaners had not properly vacuumed and cleaned the room and even intentionally left bunches of hairs on table wash basin and bed so rude even scattered our slippers on the floor after our complain and opposition we were moved to an executive room which was a bit less outdated but strangely the cleaning and room maintain service was completely different in our 8 night stay we could finally sleep 2 night a bit comfortable the breakfast dishes are mostly dirty with food and oil stains this hotel is suffering of a serious hygiene issues i do not recommend this hotel to anyone expecting stay in a starred hotel it can be a cheap dirty hostel ,0
 no lift it was a nightmare abysmal,0
 comfortable room size bathroom wifi tv channels almost everything ,1
 the view from my room was really bad i had to see construction area while i was staying at the hotel everyone expect a certain level of service when you pay the cost however this hotel is really disappointing to my family even though i paid a lot ,0
 location makes this a clear choice was easy to get to and close to the attractions and inner city,1
 very comfortable and quiet,1
 great staff ,1
 facilities and the lounge area and the buffet,1
 not friendly stuff no hot water complicated directions how to open the door robinet etc ,0
 staff are always lovely cannot do enough to help ,1
 if you are looking for a clean place then don t come near this hotel extremely rude staff ,0
 the staff were terrific and the location and cleanliness of the hotel first class ,1
 not a friendly welcoming at check in got a room with very thin walls and a drunk arguing and partying couple next door that was very noisy between midnight and 7 o clock in the morning this ruined my sleep completely breakfasts the next morning was also a disappointment when it comes to the quality of what was served overall one of the worst hotel experiences i ve ever had ,0
 everything was perfectly the worest ,0
 staff were rude and ques were long checking in no help car parking is just a joke and very inconvenient ,0
 when we went into our room there was an old person smell we had a bed that was not a double it was two singles put together,0
 rooms are so tiny only a slim single can fit in a double bed room the so called compact double bed is hardly 1 5 m x 2 m with a plane size toilet ,0
 the hotel is located within 15 mins walk to covent garden and a shoet taxi ride to the theatre district if you want to save your high heels the british museum is very close and there is close proximity to shopping and restaurants the hotel has historic links to the titanic through its architecthe which was of interest to my party the staff were very helpful ,1
 room too hot over charged rude staff ,0
 an excellent location for london sights and theatre district the staff were very friendly and accommodating super breakfast and a well stocked bar ,1
 overall atmosphere lovely room overlooking russell square nice bar,1
 the staff was rude and i had blood staines on my bed sheet and reported it to reception they did not attend until after 1 hour also there was a strong smell of drugs in the 12th floor as they gave me a smoking room i am very upset and unhappy i made them aware of this and was totally ignored ,0
 the staff of this hotel were simply horrible i ve never encountered such poor service at a hotel not to mention at a 4 star hotel they were rude and their service was absolutely horrible for example on the 1st night i asked them to bring me another blanket because it was chilly on that day but they refused to do so they simply told us they cannot do it in the evening do they not have a spare blanket on the 2nd and 3rd nights they took our blankets and didn t leave one i had to call them and fight to get a blanket the lady who was on the front desk was absolutely snotty and rude she even scolded me for not telling them sooner we were touring lovely paris during the day how could have we been able to do that during the day the room is very small and nothing worked as it should for example the hair dryer overheat every 15 seconds so i had to cool it down for 3 minutes after 15 second use it took me 20 minutes to dry my short hair the shower was horrible too this hotel was the worst aspect of our trip to paris avoid this hotel like a plague don t trust other good reviews this is a horrible hotel ,0
 location and ease of check in and check out extremely helpful staff as well ,1
 1 we stayed for five nights and had to change room twice at the beginning we were arranged to a room facing the courtyard with this very noisy ventilation machine so we didn t sleep well for the first night after i complained the next day we were then arrange to a room facing the street and on the top floor but the cold water system didn t work properly and we couldn t really use the hot water since that would be boiling the next day without using any water for one night they got it fixed but on that night there was this weird noise coming from the roof it was so loud that we could feel the vibration so we didn t have a good night sleep for the third night and finally since i complained at the beginning they didn t take it seriously they upgraded us to a suite we finally had two good nights sleep but the whole experience was so tiring and unsettled i can understand that such an old and famous hotel is hard to maintain but thought they had an expensive renovation not long ago 2 the women in the first floor restroom was so ridiculously rude i have never experienced anything like that definitely didn t expect that would happen in claridge s ,0
 towels are not clean very smelly bathroom the room is very small it doesn t deserve more than two stars,0
 the croissants were just perfect my little daughter is a picky eater but she just loves it ,1
 everything else the hotel was under construction so couldn t use the bar or restaurant not the end of the world but had no cold water for the entire stay were not moved rooms and only discounted my stay by 10 the breakfast was inedible hit food was cold and very poor service ,0
 extremely clean,1
 hot water was like warm the heat was not working even after asking for it to be fixed ,0
 everything i didn t like nothing ,0
 the bed was comfy,1
 everything the breakfast was of low quality the bed i slept on was so thin that i could feel the spring under the ac was at least 30 years old and was blowing unfiltered air very dusty the hotel shows its age and the staff are clearly in for the dough ,0
 old and very smelly food at breakfast cool in the buffet,0
 lovely staff fair size room packed in essentials,1
 our room was lovely and clean and so quiet the staff at breakfast were so helpful,1
 great value excellent location and a good breakfast,1
 absolutely everything except maybe the coffee at breakfast but we are fussy re coffee we arrived before checkin after taking a week to cycle from london our room was ready and the staff were welcoming and so accommodating regarding our bikes we were on the top floor lovely room and very comfortable bed loved looking out our window across the sorbonne it is a great location with an m s nearby for supplies ,1
 1 the service was sub standard after check in we had to find someone to help us take all of our luggage to our room they then took 30mins to bring our luggage to the room it was a huge distance between reception and the elevators of the west wing which we really didn t like as there was no easier access to our wing of the hotel 2 the room itself was terribly outdated the bathroom horrible with no shower only a step in bath a serious update is needed especially for the price you pay we didn t expect such old finishes poor quality of toilet bath 3 our room was double booked whilst unpacking another family opened the door walked in very poor management on the hotel s part although they apologized for this afterwards through a simple phone call there was no compensation offered which another hotel would ve gladly done if they had made a similar mistake given that the hilton is such a huge hotel with over 1000 guests this kind of mistake is unacceptable because dealing with many guests at any given time should be their specialty it felt more like the staff couldn t handle the number of guests during our stay 4 we requested another room that had a shower rather given that my mother struggled to use a step in bath the room offered was much smaller only for 2 people but it had a step in shower which was the only reason we agreed to move but were told we would still be charged the same price for this new room as the family room we were previously booked into this to me is unacceptable given that the room was smaller not a family room 5 the breakfast situation was really unpleasant besides there being a very poor variety of foods drinks breakfast was served in the banquet hall because the usual restaurant which was much nicer could not accommodate so many guests ,0
 room was lovely plus position of hotel is great surprisingly quiet ,1
 abusive sarcastic m staff,0
 if the shower protection board is extended longer will gain extra comfort using it,0
 the room and the location are really nice ,1
 staff bar and room were great superb position will return ,1
 poor value for money room in the attic with on suite but no other facilities other than room service ,0
 beds are very comfy location is nice rooms are spacious,1
 bed very comfy great location extremely friendly staff,1
 ridiculously overpriced couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page staff unfriendly and unhelpful included breakfast was basic boring and cold bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for 2 months there for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day bed not made properly dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish would not recommend this hotel to anyone email i sent still unanswered ,0
 service staff facility,0
 too pricy for the size of the room they charged twice for the room,0
 everything was perfect well ok the phone in room 147 didn t work friendly staff very professional and a great central location ,1
 the service was awful they refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning ,0
 the bed and location,1
 unappealing interior decoration of hotel in general and especially the room was charged about 30 more than booking com stated in booking confirmation ,0
 breakfast and staff were excellent,1
 ineffective staff faulty air conditioning and dirty coridors,0
 lots of restaurants two train uderground stations grocery shops convenience stores,1
 3 hour check i,0
 shabby carpets cooked breakfast was apoling,0
 as we walked into the hotel to check in we where greeted by staff and shown where to check in as we checked in we found the staffs english hard to understand made it even worse when we phoned to complain they referred us to the restaurants phone line which was totally irrelevant we then went to our room which didn t look anything like what we seen in pictures it also had a bad smell and was very out dated every night we could hear the lift going up and down and found this very annoying the hilton also took two payments out of my bank which totalled up to 600 pound which i later had to contact the bank to get this back as the hilton found that they couldn t do anything to help definitely not worth the money ,0
 definitely cleanliness could have been better sheets were not changed n bed was dirty amenities in the toilet were not properly stocked up food quality was poor,0
 it s a shame but there was alot not to like such as staff interaction was poor lack knowledge of the area cleaning staff knocking on the door at 8am regardless of dnd sign the wall paper in the room was filthy and ripped the ceiling had unfinished work done to it looked really bad the breakfast was extremely poor but the staff where lovely the main bar fridays only open for an 90 on bank holiday sunday 0 atmosphere a shame really no intrest show in accomodation marathon runners with regard to travel advise or meals for overall quality barely scrapes 2 stars ,0
 room excellent,1
 the hotel itself is actually not the nice victorian red brick building in the photos but a modern build attached to the side of it rooms are pretty awkward there were only 2 sockets in the whole apartment and one was so close to the desk you couldn t plug anything into it the area was noisy and despite advice saying you could park nearby all day for 7 this turned out to be untrue the location of the hotel is quite far away from a tube station so the cheaper room price was probably negated by the extra bus tube fares and long stay parking cost breakfasts were also pretty poor ,0
 bed very compy,1
 having a studio room,1
 pathetic service waited for hours to get a glass of drinking water in the reception area very inflexible around check in times limited repetitive and boring breakfast spread,0
 dirtestttttttttttttt hotel ever huge cockroach was running in the room used condoms and food remains found under sofa never cleaned ,0
 breakfast was amazing,1
 was not advised i would be receiving an access affordable room under the equalities act this would not be an issue but as i have a l4 and l5 vertebrae bending to the low level wash hand basin was painful more so the drop down support arm beside the toilet bowl was used to support the towels which i found to be very unhygienic ,0
 have stayed here a few times now really good base to visit paris really comfortable and great location with good connection to central paris good staff and really comfy bed ,1
 my flight was cancelled and they even asked me to pay for it after argument they said that i have to book two rooms i booked one room on the booking for 2 adults and 2 kids and it is ok but they first asked me to pay for delayed night and then forced us to book 2 rooms direct carpet old facility cold staffs terrible experiences,0
 the staff and management was rude and extremely unhelpful we paid for accommodation on bookings com when we got to the hotel they made us pay again so we paid double accommodation the reception lady was the rudest and most unfriendly person we have ever come across the tap in the bathroom was broken the plug was broken the room was tiny the air conditioning was broken there was a portable aircon that was put in the room by the window in essence the window had to stay open the entire night and we could not get any sleep as we could hear all the noise from the street with the window being open park lane mews hotel was the most expensive in the area did not include breakfast whenever we asked for assistance everyone treated us badly and made us feel like we are a problem to them this is without a doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed at and i do not recommend this hotel to anyone ,0
 perfect luxurious but not pretentious,1
 a very comfortable and pleasant stay the location is fabulous ,1
 the room was awful for a 4 hotel and a long way from the main reception also it was a challenge to find the room normally in such a layout someone would at least escort you to a lift or even tell where it is small room dated and all over priced ,0
 the staff is the most unaccomidating i ve ever encountered my husband and i traveled from paris to london with no problems with wifi i asked the staff three times the first night concerning the non functioning wifi in our room the one staff member basically said there was something wrong with my phone or user error yet the moment i went downstairs and went to the dining area there was no problem connecting they just repeated over and over nothing was wrong and no one else had been complaining that was until someone walked in headed back to their room asking if the wifi was fixed yet according to the staff no one had made a complaint fishy however the bed bugs is what sent us running i went downstairs after scratching all day to ask staff to switch us to a different room as i had about ten bites he said this was impossible as there were no other rooms available i asked three times then to speak to a manager who was unavailable til the next morning but once my husband realized he was getting bit he went downstairs to talk to the same person all of a sudden there was a room available this member of staff was rude the whole time and said i wasn t even considering moving to another room but 20 minutes prior there was no other room to move to so after asking for a refund and being on the phone with booking com the we were only refunded for two nights however i paid for 4 they only refunded me for the two nights we stayed not even the two nights we did not stay and had to book another hotel down the street which was so understanding and accomidatimg probably the single best hotel we ve stayed at when we are in london next we will not hesitate to book with hilton double tree ,0
 they had pathetic staff who couldn t answer basic question about the internet service they were providing i had to pay twice for getting the internet activated on my laptop ,0
 staff very polite and friendly great location excellent breakfast rooms are modern and comfortable close to 2 underground stations numerous bars restaurants shops regularly stay in this area and the grande royale is the best hotel i ve used so far ,1
 excellent location if you are attending the o2 venue for a concert or event,1
 noisy staff shouting from kitchen area tiny bathroom not enough room to sit on toilet due to proximity of shower cubicle given worst room as booked through booking com won t be staying here again awful ,0
 room poor unvomfortable and cramped staff attitude poor expensive for what it was,0
 style breakfast bar meals great staff ,1
 the staff were so friendly and helpful when i checked in i was told that my room had been upgraded which was a lovely surprise beautiful room with such a comfy bed ,1
 i have asked a double bed but the room had 2 twin beds pushed together and it was not comfortable to sleep ,0
 this hotel is very central and i enjoyed my one night stay ,1
 sheets were stained bed was uncomfortable pictures were not reflective of the space the space was too small even for one person walls were dirty ,0
 great value for money ,1
 nice room with bedside on a loft and the nice gesture for a free drink due to renovation of the premises ,1
 big comfy room and the reception staff were excellent,1
 in my room i found a sanitary towel bag used for disposal of period towels etc with blood on it the manager at the time came and agreed that it was blood i wasn t offered any compensation at all for what had happened the side was simply wiped off i have photographic evidence of the item ,0
 free upgrade guest of the day,1
 room,0
 the fast efficient friendly service with a smile excellent food bar and overall atmosphere my wife normally doesn t like big hotels but she would come again happily ,1
 the worst hotel experience of my life but you are aware of our and many other visitors issues,0
 cozy botique hotel clean rooms excellent location with easy access to tube queensway station and bayswater district line also very close to kensington park which is worth a visit exceptional service levels very helpful staff with smile on their faces helped me in booking a luxury cab till airport at very reasonable price the team has accommodated my request for an early check in by couple of hours super speed wifi i will surely stay back in this hotel and would strongly recommend for a comfortabl stay and pocket friendly prices booked a club size room and i must say it was a very decent size considering london room size standards loved overall experience keep up the good work team ,1
 the bedroom was disgusting and dirty and smelt stale like a working mans club the breakfast was very poor too it is in serious need of a shake up it s very tired,0
 discourteous and inconsiderate staff very impolite to pricey for what it offers we shifted to bearby hyat which was way more comfortable and even offered breakfast,0
 definitelly not a 4 start hotel massively overpriced for what it is rooms were super small my room was at the ground floor and i could hear everything from outside no amenities ,0
 poor quality room and bed,0
 everything,0
 location,1
 good location,1
 staff were unfriendly hotel facilities were rubish would never stay here again,0
 this is not a 4 star hotel 1 star b b would be pushing it totally deceptive photos will stay at the hilton next time considering it s the same price ,0
 excellent central location help full staff very clean was good value for money easy parking ,1
 long waiting at checkin long waiting at checkout sinply because noboby was there old rooms dirty poor interior,0
 breakfast was not worth 21 euros room downstairs low choice bad coffee stuff showed up after 20 minutes rude and unfriendly manager she did not take my problems with the room serious really not what you expect from a 4 star hotel ,0
 the garden was an added bonus especially in the sunshine ,1
 spacey rooms ,1
 the small voyer into the rooms makes a room ,1
 everything absolute top knotch hotel staff couldnt be more helpful and rooms spacious and modern breakfast amazing bed amazing ,1

 rooms too small superior double or deluxe double wont make any difference,0
 very friendly staff great breakfast,1
 everything ,1
 being able to have breakfast in our room wearing a bathrobe and watching tv room layout very good,1
 room was very small only one pretty uncomfortable chair sticky surfaces therefore not as clean as it should be noisy air conditioning check in staff distracted by someone else half way through the process ,0
 when i arrived they had almost given my room away they said they called me but there was no missed call on my phone wet paint on the walls and it does not wash off your cloths shower room was humid and smelt of mould when i looked up i saw the paint starting to come off the ceiling thankfully i do not have allergies to mould like my other half exposed nail sharp side by side lamp switch nice little shock before attempting going to sleep tiny room no table no safe slow wifi parking was not in the building but at the nearest q park i did get a 20 discount aircon slow nearly not working no window i asked for a quiet room but i could hear music from the hall way and people walking on the floor above it was a long and stressful night before an important meeting the next day not a good place for work related short stays ,0
 i booked for my partners birthday and i can t express enough how helpful and sweet all the staff were at the reception and door helping me with the gifts and balloons i had brought along we had a nice spacious room with a bath and shower and lovely view and we absolutely loved the jacuzzi and swimming pool we went to the sky bar on the top floor and was lucky enough to get the seats near the window with a view of the city lights thank you so so much for such an amazing stay my partner said it was one of the best stays he s ever had and was a special experience for the both of us cannot wait to come back we re having a look already when we can book again extra big thank you to a member of staff called shannon for making it extra special ,1
 the staff at park plaza were excellent ,1
 great location in central london very comfortable room with great facilities we were lucky enough to get a room upgrade and the hotel stored our bags for us on check out day ,1
 scrambled egg was brilliant the highlight of a very well supplied breakfast buffet fantastic location very helpful and friendly staff good value for money for the location ,1
 absolutely unresponsive staff air conditioner in my room was not working for the consecutive days they didn t corrected it when things become our of control they put a pedestal fan instead of changing the room or correcting the ac any call to room service would talk even days to service so little options in breakfast and absolutely nil options for vegetarians overall very bad experience,0
 lovely clean efficient facilities in addition our afternoon tea was perfect ,1
 the internet wifi not good at all its not free the room was so hot no air condition at all also the windows not open view was bad the room was not sea view,0
 the rooms were very dusty also early morning noise as the hotel is near to a helipad,0
 checked in late as the room wasn t originally ready the first time air conditioning wasn t working the thermostat was physically broken and obviously had been for months at first the duty manager couldn t be bothered to deal with it at all eventually he came up and refused us a replacement room although it was obviously broken after much fuss he eventually arranged for a portable air conditioner which basically didn t work just kept stopping and starting noisily so we turned it off next morning i noticed the safety test certificate was two months out of date illegally so i checked the kettle the next morning and it was over a year out of date again illegally the manager that night didn t give a damn next morning at reception i found myself next to someone else with exactly the same issue except he had been given a replacement room although he was complaining it wasn t much better so the duty manager lied about no available rooms receptionist next morning basically said it happens all the time the place is a dump even if anything had been working or legally certified it would only rate 1 star not the four they claim avoid this place or get what you deserve from a management who don t care ,0
 to small room insuficient lighting missing hanger old fashion bathroom ,0
 the bed was amazing hotel was spotless and staff were super ,1
 location and staff nice and efficient,1
 location and access to tube,1
 very comfortable bed spacious room great location ,1
 impossibly small dark room room was described as larger which was misleading and too small to even open my small case no top or desk area for small personal items there was only a shelf approximate size 6 inches depth ,0
 room service cleaning not good breakfast restaurant was very poor in variety of food poor service staff some times the service not clean very poor facility for self service which is not accepted as i am coming to the hotel to be served and relax not to serve my self ,0
 location was fantastic right by everything ,1
 the breakfast buffet was excellent staff attentive the staff overall were friendly and helpful ,1
 the furniture was cracked the walls were unclean and the bed base was broken along with having to go up 97 steps to get to my apartment,0
 pool and spa facility were great bed was comfortable ,1
 hotel was very modern and clean staff very polite and helpful great location ,1
 i didn t like the hotel policy of no smoking they are very smug in their belief of this hence they will never again get my custom the grange city hotel is much better cleaner and has a good customer focus and they have a good attitude towards smokers,0
 poor room expected at least a toilet lid that stayed up when toilet was being used ,0
 they took 100 from me amd didn t give me back hidden charges as v a t,0
 late check out,1
 friendly helpful staff made us feel like we were vip we will be staying here again hopefully in march the original wooden decor and the ornate michaelangelo painted ceilings are a sight to behold really loved it food was excellent with plenty of choice,1
 the entrance is through a tunnel that smells of sewage the reception desk seemed to be manned by three people when there was no clients there and only one junior slow person whenever a queue started to build up the common areas are clearly in need of refurbishment and even the rooms seem tired and quite grubby in parts ,0
 room is too small and no space for luggage staff were not friendly too costly for such service and room ,0
 staff,1
 we got a free upgrade to penthouse which was amazing looking onto london eye was my daughter s 18th so made it more special staff were lovely and very helpful ,1
 room was freezing window wide open when we got there safe in the room was broken reported it 4pm on friday still not fixed by the time we left sunday had to go around all weekend with passports on us it was raining all weekend and when we went back to the hotel room you couldn t even warm up as there s no heating working we will never use again,0
 not value for money,0
 bedroom clean and comfortsble,1
 almost everything rooms smelled of smoke so offered to downgrade me when i didn t want to do that was told i had to keep the original room the next day they then agreed to move me whilst i was out for the day and they didn t do apparently they forgot despite all the notes the staff left for that to happen on checkout i then had to wait 15 mins for a manager to complain to which didn t happen because he was too busy to talk to me and ultimately had to run out to catch the train will never stay at a mercure again useless in pretty much all respects,0
 it was such an amazing hotel lovely bathroom massive comfortable bed attached to the o2 absolutely amazing and definitely worth the money ,1
 there is a construction in the next building we couldnt sleep at all we were waking up at 7 am because of the loud noise we asked the hotel staff to change our room but they said they couldnt although there were available rooms in the hotel we asked to get refund and move to another hotel and they again said no so we had to stay on our last day we just asked for three hours late checkout because our flight was late they said they cant even there were again available rooms and the hotel wasnt fully booked we said you ruined our stay and we didnt say anything so you at least owe us that but all we got was no we cant help you so dont stay there the staff is not friendly and willing to help at all ,0
 microwave oven in the room made it very convenient to reheat food making you save some money from eating in restaurants location was great very near the station and to the london eye ,1
 size comfort and overall cleanliness of the room convenient strip of restaurants shops nearby ,1
 location,1
 apartment style room excellent for extra space with disabled partner and privacy for adult extra guest to stay good accessibility for wheelchair user great view of the shard comfortable and quiet but 5 minutes from waterloo ,1
 everything was fantastic the staff was friendly the room was amazing and comfortable and quiet breakfast was the best with a good selection of hot and cold it s the best hotel my fianc and i have ever stayed at and will stay there again when next we go to london ,1
 the staff was not polite not flexible lost between computers angry a girl slow my name was even not spelled on the guest list was noted with one capital letter on the reception was usually nobody etc ,0
 services room n location,1
 the peace and quiet and also the location i think george the dragon is brilliant,1
 room was in the basement surrounded by unfinished rooms it s a good job i m not claustrophobic as it was the tiniest room possible there were staff members banging things around at about midnight the toilet had never had a good clean there was a serious scum line around the bowl the breakfast was meagre and to say it was in a coffee shop the instant coffee in the room would have been hotter and tastier ,0
 a great ambience as you walk in ,1
 the room and hotel was dirty bedrooms had wood floor so you could hear every room around you room door was poor in terms of sound barriers so you can hear every single noise reception staff were unfriendly and unwelcoming not a great experience at all ,0
 room furniture old could not see television from bed or chairs you had to stand at door to see car park to hard to get in or out charged 21 stirling at breakfast still waiting for cup of tea food poor,0
 room was dirty dated and i ordered a suite but they simply connected 2 rooms and then put 2 single beds together to make a double despite my request not to certainly poor value for money bed was extremely uncomfortable and totally uneven ,0
 the room was the smallest i ve stayed in in london and not as the image suggested for a deluxe room,0
 tiny bedroom no lounge sitting area no nice breakfast room funny smell in hotel horrible ire from bedroom window,0
 amazing location and view ,1
 hotel staff is incredible unprofessional and unpleasant hotel treats guests as guilty unless they prove otherwise in executive rooms on the first level you can enjoy every passing of noisy underground train with wall 30cm from the window on the first floor there are some rooms with heavy smell from bathroom pipes and mold many times you have to wait in the line for the breakfast but still with no order never again even for free ,0
 polite and helpful staff the hotel has an ambiance that helps to relax the staff were chatty and friendly will return,1
 the advertisement was misleading as i thought i had booked park plaza hotel,0
 stayed in room 226 comfy bed and pillows quiet room facing lovely garden super clean and neat good size flat screen tv with lots of channels staff wonderfully helpful food in bar restaurant really good and priced on par with other sit down table service restaurants two minute walk from earl s court tube also every convenience a traveler could want located right on earl s court road several bank atms pubs and other eateries laundry dry cleaning services even america fast food if you need your fix mcdonald s burger king kfc and starbucks there s even a retractable clothes line in the shower for those travelers like me who do a bit of sink laundry i always remind my fellow americans who are not used to european hotel rooms that rooms are small compared to us standards but comfort cleanliness and location rank far higher in my opinion than wasted floor space ,1
 bed very very comfy staff extremely friendly location for o2 perfect no rushing after concert for tube just a short walk 5 mins and a cocktail overlooking london at night ,1
 there was a small microwave sink dishes and refrigerator in the room,1
 wifi didn t work television didn t work room was very small 20 minute wait for lifts very expensive for what you get ,0
 liked the size or room and the view,1
 lots of fleas in the bedroom i got bug s bite more than 50 points the worst room condition ever ,0
 very clean and great location,1
 the room was very small it was more like a cell with sliding shutters instead of curtains it was the noisiest london hotel we have ever stayed in ,0
 fab service quick and efficient check in and friendly staff ,1
 no hot water half the stay,0
 horrible hard beds staff didn t speak english got breakfast order wrong 3 times air con was ineffective way too expensive for what it is ,0
 i actually live round the corner from this hotel and booked it as a birthday surprise for my sister and her fiance as a romantic break and a great way for us to catch up easily the following day not only did i book it at a greatly discounted price but they were so lovely to upgrade the couple to the beautiful lilly langtry suite my sister adores 4 poster beds and the only way to describe the suite is as magnificent and they also provided complimentary wine chocolates and a fruit basket they let me know the next day that the bar staff were also truly phenomenal friendly service as well as front of house with opulent decor and great drink prices i book and stay in a lot of hotels as an event planner and most definitely will be recommending this one to everyone and making sure that i get to stay myself one day soon ,1
 overall the hotel was spot on,1
 location,1
 location great close to paddington station and some really nice restaurants and pubs near by ,1
 located in a quiet residential area yet close to hyde park transport links shops and restaurants room was quite small but bed was comfy and bathroom was clean liked the air conditioning and wet room style shower staff were courteous polite and helpful ,1
 location and price were excellent,1
 it seems it needs to be very careful to make your booking as the hotel does not allow any flexibility in changing your plan the furthermore be careful with your money as it might be taken for some reason that you did not understand beforehand it seems it needs to be very careful to make your booking as the hotel does not allow any flexibility in changing your plan the furthermore be careful with your money as it might be taken for some reason you did not understand beforehand i booked a room via booking for a 3 nights stay as we found that we did not like the hotel very much when we arrived i tried to negotiate with the lady who helped me to do the check in to see if i can use the credit for the third night to upgrade a room and she said probably not working but i could pay an extra 50 pounds for upgrading a room as we were not satisfied with the room type we booked in advance we agreed to pay to upgrade and i paid a deposit of 150 pounds and we left after the second night staying so we only stayed for two nights the lady who helped me to check out asked me if we was not going to stay for the third night i confirmed this and returned the key and she told me the deposit would go back to my card so i expected to have 50 pounds refund i paid 150 for the deposit as we did not stay for the third night but i didn t see it come to my account so i called booking to ask about this and the booking team tried to ask the hotel and negotiate with them but the hotel said as my previous booking was three nights so they also charged the upgrade fee for the third night that s extremely ridiculous as i did not stay for the third night firstly i didn t say i wanted to have a three night upgrade as i have clearly told the lady in the front desk who was helping me to check in that i would only stay two nights secondly no one told me that the upgrade was for three nights and non refundable ,0
 had to wait 30 minutes to check in was told the double room i had booked had been sold to someone else so i was in a twin room room was freezing with no ability to turn off the air conditioning tried to order food but nobody available wifi didn t work absolutely terrible stay ,0
 this hotel is absolutely rubbish sorry to say that i arrived to the room and it looked okay i got to the toilet and shower room and toilet seat were dirty the previous guest s shampoo conditioner hand soap and the shower gel were still there when i got to bed i start scratching as the materials are not clean enough i highly do not recommend this hotel at all i asked the receptionist to give me a refund but he refused ,0
 breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory plenty of choices for all bed was very comfortable bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water location could not have been better very short walk to underground beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel very quiet in spite of being close to earl s court rd staff was friendly and helpful everyone was very easy to deal with ,1
 bed is small and not clean photo in booking are very different from actual room in total room was very small even you can t move with free space and you need to toich every thing in your way to bath or door quality of food was fair with the price i give i didnt like that they was laying about room also the left was not working for 2 days and i was staying in 3rd flower,0
 the hotel is in a very convenient location for central london and was great value for money our booking was made at a very reasonable rate and we just wanted rooms for one night but they were also able to give us rooms with baths on a special request ,1
 very small rooms ive booked 10 delux double rooms on check in i realised it is not even sufficient for a single person beds were very small and no space at all i suggest the hotel to seriously look into this i will never book this hotel once again definitely i seriously doubt on the ability of the hotel to get repeated customers ,0
 air con non existant rooms dirty management promised things and didn t deliver would not recommend,0
 position,1
 the location the hotel the staff everything about it is amazing,1
 excellent location v friendly staff,1
 great location friendly staff good selection at breakfast perfect,1
 i had one of the worst traveling experiences this was suppose to be a 4 star hotel where i paid a sum of money only to be disrespected by a taxi driver contacted by the hotel when i reported the incident i was left with apathy no appologies or even getting back to me with a reaponse the hotel itself is definetely not a 4 stars one it is barely 2 stars i was at first accomodated in a lousy room 101 where cleanliness was a huge issue when i complained i was offered after the 2nd night to be moved into a better one which was probably the only good gesture the staff offered however still the hotel did not meet the 4 stars expectations at all,0

 the staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they had a good knowledge of the area the fact that it was such a direct route for stade de france we were there for the rugby match france v england ,1
 the reception,0
 room didn t get serviced despite asking on several occasions,0
 cocktails and extremely helpful staff especially peter,1
 all very nice staff wonderful nothing too much trouble ,1
 firstly the room wasn t ready the male manager was extremely rude to the receptionist who was only a trainee we were taken on a wild goose chase around the hotel as they hurriedly tried to find a room to fit us in and he even had the cheek to say it was upgraded the breakfast left a lot to be desired with the sausages looking limp and the eggs resembling a pile of sick the cacophony of noise emitting from the man woman buffalo from another room which sounded like their lungs were falling out their nose,0
 room was lovely and comfortable,1
 great location and a lovely room huge bath and walk in shower a huge hd television with full sky package ,1
 no wi fi for 2 days ,0
 the rooms weren t cleaned and tea and coffee not replenished will never be going back,0
 beautiful building lovely corner suite quiet and cozy close to tube and the british museum definitely going back ,1
 ridiculously small room i have been to tokyo and even there my room were never that small way too expensive for a cupboard ,0
 the night staff were unbelievably rude and abrupt and so was the restaurant manager no manners what so ever will never stay at this hotel again also very far from mayfair which is pointless as it takes 20 30 min to oxford street and back no halaal food,0
 friendly staff easy access to the underground and buses ,1
 location is ideal for visiting central london staff were attentive ,1
 bed was like sleeping on a cloud spacious and well equipped room great breakfast ,1
 the friendly staff,1
 no hot water in the morning we found a leak in bathroom after being out all day which flooded the bathroom and my wife slipped over and hurt her back we reported this and man on the front desk said he would look into it we had no come back from him and 2 hrs later the bathroom was still flooded so we had to clean this up ourselves ,0
 service was but nothing no one was helpful or capable of giving correct advice to the simplest question toilet seat shimmered yellow ceiling ad water cracks ,0
 rooms ,0
 service room bar,0
 the room its too small and the way that i had to pay ,0
 the bed was uncomfortable 2 single beds pushed together the bathroom needs replacing tiles loose on floor plug didn t work in bath and needed a good clean ,0
 the location was great near the train station and a nice eating area near by great for sadlers wells theatre rooms lovely and clean,1
 the staff were completely and utterly rude especially on arrival the gentleman was so rude not a very good start staff need to learn to smile and have some manners the state of the room lower than average needs a reno was most disappointed ,0
 the room had no heating even though i was promised everyday that this was going to be taken care of the floor was dirty and the breakfast was of poor quality ,0
 the hotel was the best that i have ever stayed in the reason i booked it was because it was near enough attached to the o2 myself my two daughter s 32 30 yrs old went to see take that although this was our sixth time of seeing them it was still exciting to see them the show once again was fantastic after it was just a short walk to our hotel fab u lou s ,1
 staff are very friendly rooms are clean and the place is ambience,1
 the location of the hotel is perfect it s within walking distance of the major attractions of the city or close to temple or blackfriars tube stations should you want to go further afield the superior rooms have very modern decor and the large bath is a real pleasure after a long day walking there are safes in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities for that first morning cuppa the room was very quiet at night the bed is very large and comfortable the curtains keep the light out overall giving a good nights sleep the staff are very attentive polite and helpful ,1
 rooms unfussy and uncluttered nice to have a bath beds comfortable overall hotel decor a big plus ,1
 excellent breakfast ,1
 best hotel in london an oasis of calm ,1
 good location fab facilities,1
 room and bathroom were very small,0
 not much near the hotel and quite a bit of a walk to the hotel,0
 very clean and comfortable good variety for breakfast ,1
 the bedding very poor quality and uncomfortable it was suppose to be a queen bed however i noticed they were two single beds put together at night they separate and becomes very uncomfortable,0
 staff are very miserable and never smile or acknowledge your presence restaurant shuts early in the evening despite being advertised as open till 9pm ,0
 beds cotton sheets balcony bath staff were particularly friendly and helpful ,1
 excellent service and great value for money ,1
 decor confort the relaxed atmosphere,1
 the staff were very pleasant and helpful we also had a free upgrade which was most appreciated the location was good with the tube a few minutes walk away,1
 i paid for a room with an eiffel tower view and all i got was a view of the tip of the tower total lie the room and hallway smelled bad the room was so small i couldn t turn around,0
 the location,1
 very uncomfortable and stiflingly hot i contemplated sleeping in the lobby as it seemed to be the only place that had air conditioning not worth a fraction of the price it commands ,0
 the room cost 285 and had no window at no point during the booking process was i told this when i complained to the staff they said i should have asked if i wanted a window as some of the rooms at this price have windows i said i generally assume that for 285 a room comes with a window and i should not need to ask for one i should be told if a room does not have a window during the booking process like i am with the low cost hotel providers in the city a bad start to a family holiday utterly disgraceful hotel and staff giving my favourite city a bad name travel to london but avoid this hotel ,0
 check in process smooth,1
 the slough marriott stuff were much politer and attentive ,0
 dirty and tired,0
 everything it mean everything,1
 received complementary extras to celebrate birthday ,1
 quirky hotel full of character from the past loved the bar especially the memories of lily langtree friendly and helpful staff great location opposite hyde park and a couple of minutes from nearest tube station ,1
 the duplex room design ,1
 overall a nice stay ,1
 i was offered non smoking or a window since when were they incompatible options and the bed was uncomfortable i could feel every spring ,0
 the room was shabby especially bathroom ingrained dirt in bath and door swollen and knackered mouldy tiles ,0
 the televissin is very small,0
 handi the electronic guide was great i don t know how we would have seen so much without him a fabulous idea also thank you for acknowledging my daughter s birthday ,1
 the staff is not polite at all from check in to check out no hospitality when serving us we booked junior suite but the room need renovation especially the bathroom sometimes the hot water is off ,0
 we couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse the bed linen was stinked rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it the four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by uk standards i will give it two stars ,0
 lovely traditional and good location,1
 the rooms were very clean and all staff was polite,1
 tiny cramped rooms and if you book direct its cheaper compared to booking com plus they include breakfast they also encourage you at check in to book direct with them to save money and get breakfast neither of which i received not recommended at all ,0
 the staff are very unfriendly the rooms are dirty and extremely warn the rooms look nothing like the pictures on the internet which is very deceiving ,0
 dirty room tv not working properly cold i wouldn t stay there with a baby again breakfast is terrible not worth the money our baby was sick they charged us for 5 min 10 extra for late checkout disgusting management terrible ,0
 small bedroom photo on the web miss leading 4 star i don t think so ,0
 heater was not working properly,0
 the email asking if we had any special needs before our stay was a really nice touch ,1
 no id check about customer greedy on money only ,0
 it s tired looking place and kinda dodgy entrance ,0
 great location not cheap but then again you are in london very helpful staff ,1
 excellent room layout,1
 i felt that some of the staff could have been a little more helpful than just working off a script the girls on check in seemed fine earlier in the morning but when i came back later to get my keys the gentleman on there was so cant be bothered to be here attitude some of the staff didn t seem genuine at all actually felt a little embarrassed around them not the best value for the money ,0
 bad services small rooms they don t care about my complaints,0
 poor service and not delivering on what was promised,0
 on arrival we were advised without any apology that we would be moving hotels because they had booking issues we planned our trip around staying in that location and specifically wanted a traditional hotel not a modern one with dirty restaurant that we got moved to my wife was was pregnant and we did not want to be shuttled around hotels on what was meant to be a special weekend away we have not received a word of apology from the hotel after our visit ,0
 location and grandeur of the hotel,1
 i was treated very well by the staff especially a young lady called amalia who helped host our stay and make it as nice as possible ,1
 the beds were sooo comfortable the young men to carry the bags were great it was close to two tubes and kensington,1
 staff was friendly and helpful manager showed us to our room on check in our room was up graded at check in because a room at the level we had requested was not yet available we were treated lavishly during our entire stay could not have asked for more ,1
 the cleaning staff have an appauling attitude towards my female partner they were very rude and somewhat offensive often sigh and screw there face up at you,0
 didn t feel very secure in the rooms was laying in bed one evening watching television and a male who did not work at the establishment entered the room realising we was in bed continued to walk back exiting the room view from the room was rail lines and the side of a building over priced for what you was getting almost 20 for a pre made sandwich didn t enjoy it at all paris i feel after going was a huge waste of money eiffel tower is swarmed by beggars gentleman selling tat men that will walk over grab your hand and continue to tie bracelets around your hands without consent when asked what they are doing and how much is this going to cost they said don t worry hakuna matata after saying i have no notes they untied the bracelet and moved to the next couple and taxi bikes that will ride i front of you almost running you down and continue to bug you when ignoring them will shout curses at you in french when walking away rubbish piles stacked metres from the hotel cupboards boxes mattresses tramps cover the streets around the hotel some not very many beautiful buildings the rest is almost like council apartments although france can be beautiful do not go to paris it was pretty much a building site the sky line was filled with cranes and sheet metal fences just wanted to pay leave and come home ,0
 location space everything,1
 the staff were all very helpful the breakfast was good value for money the room was spacious and quiet,1
 cleanliness,0
 location excellent breakfast very good adequate comfortable room ,1
 curtains would not close,0
 couldn t fault our stay,1
 smelly room no facilities in the hotel,0
 front desk was very helpful with booking reservations and helping to make our 209th wedding anniversary a special memory ,1
 very bad front desk the front desk staff and their system do not provide any customer satisfaction ,0
 great location we attended a concert at the o2 arena and chose this hotel based on its close proximity and it didn t disappoint good choice of restaurants and bars nearby plus the underground being a ten minute walk away hotel was clean and well presented pleasant view from the hotel window ,1
 cleanliness efficiency of staff good value breakfast quiet rooms despite location of hotel in buzzing student quarter,1
 the room design and comfort is fantastic nice combination of the old wooden ceiling and modern furniture and artwork great bathroom and fantastic walk in shower beautiful and modern interior friendly staff ,1
 attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in studio was smaller that i expected it came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle not enough toiletries provided for a family of four two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time there seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the friday and saturday night not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny also black algae in our shower surround had to repeatedly get key card reactivated room was showing signs of wear and tear faucet tap was loose mirror was cracked worst of all was the stench from the drains this was stifling some times usually at night ,0
 the room itself was very comfortable,1
 all,0
 loved it,1
 clean comfortable room good breakfast,1
 hotel stuff not being good to a frequent guest as well as a regular guest i guess they lack a proper hospitality as the hotel always run full occupancy even as an spg member i was treated like a normal guest i ve discussed this with them they answered me coz i booked through booking such an attitude yet this attitude is repeated again and again with every visit i make so this time i decided to leave a comment and i m going to send an email to spg loyalty program about my history with this hotel i visit other spg hotels i really was treated differently than normal guest enough is enough the hotel should do more than what it s doing ,0
 the room was not cleaned properly one night i came back and saw 2 dirty clothes left by the cleaner on top of the desk it s sub standard for a so called 4 star hotel ,0
 emails prior to check in were unanswered a request for a travel cot in the room was ignored the rooms were not cleaned properly the decor was terrible and the property was in a visible state of decay throughout the gym was the worst i ve seen in a hotel woken up every morning by construction work in the hotel kept up every night by the night club in the hotel the concierge made mistakes with requests the room service staff forgot items we d ordered the food in the hotel was very poor quality and very expensive this is a 2 or 3 start hotel at best ,0
 room was vile first room given didn t even have a window change rooms to a room that s carpet looked like it have been eaten by bugs staff slow hotel out of date and not value for money,0
 helpfulness of reception staff lovely bar food before we went to a concert at the apollo easy check out,1
 clean towelling gown and slippers provided balcony that overlooked the park helpful and friendly staff having tea and coffee making facilites in the room very comfortable bed ,1
 bed service and staff all excellent got some fantastic few extras in the suite with it being our honeymoon ,1

 the hotels appearance is amazing the staff was nice and helpful the first double room was tiny but the staff kindly switched us to a nicer twin bed room on our demand on the second day ,1
 breakfast was good and hotel short walk from tube and many sites ,1
 having money frozen in my account even before i got to the hotel when i wanted to pay in cash,0
 clean functionable nice bathroom good connection to underground,1
 excellent breakfast,1
 very polite staff convenient location ,1
 a pleasant comfortable room not large but perfectly nice pleasant helpful staff ,1
 very tired dated and small rooms not worth anything like what they cost per night ,0
 i booked a double and a triple room and pre paid nine months ago when we arrived at the hotel they had no record of the triple room and we ended up being on the same floor but about fifteen rooms apart my husband and i had to split up and sleep with the kids as they were frighted by themselves obviously the rooms were poorly serviced not cleaned well and mini bar not restocked breakfast boxes ordered and paid for with an early flight were never delivered we were extremely disapointed with our stay at mercure hotel yes the location is wonderful everything else underwhelmingly bad ,0
 the size of the room is like a pigeon hole you can not even open your suitcase in the room terrible room size ,0
 i liked the atmosphere the staff were very helpful to a first timer in london me the room was clean and well maintained during my stay ,1
 bed in room i was given is ready for the tip room was tiny ,0
 the room was advertised as deluxe it was tiny will no space to work in the desk,0
 size of the room,0
 the forced declaration i had to make at the reception not told we would be on the basement no windows no kettle staff refused first refused to replace the missing kettle,0
 the rooms and corridors need seriously updating there were stains on the carpets and they were also threadbare patched up plaster on walls taps loose in the bathroom towel warmer was chipped off and rusting and air conditioner did not work very poor for a very hot night when we d spent 170 for the room for one night not good enough ,0
 staff location facilities brilliant breakfast my grandson s first london visit and concert we will remember our stay and concert forever ,1
 some staff,0
 from the moment i arrived i was told that breakfast wasn t included in the price but when i booked it the person said it was my room had a leak from the ac but it was clearly an ongoing problem as there was a huge mouldy stain on the carpet the room was dusty and the usb port was broken i made a complaint and i don t feel like it was taken seriously ,0
 central to tourist highlights walking distance to st paul s cathedral bourough market theatres covent garden ,1
 bath room shower head is broken dirty tea pot serve to guest ,0
 we liked all of it but the children especially liked the lifts with glass windows and the gym ,1
 staff were superb helpful and friendly,1
 had a long busy day enjoying london sights had early dinner was knackered by 8 30 pm thought bath and relax in room with tv no luck no tv signal complained twice over one and half hours then went to reception who had apathy and i ll tell the maintenance man end of bathroom dirty hair in bath on floor in loo bath handle broken no hot water paintwork very tired and yellowed mentioned to reception we had no hot water she said i ll tell the maintenance man no hot water either in the morning for a shower room maid barged in at 8 30 she rang doorbell but came straight in anyway before we could say no thanks it was very embarrassing on check out we mentioned no hot water other issues and was nonchalantly told i ll tell the maintenance man ,0
 small room breakfast was not really good cleaning room not really at the same level everyday,0
 the location for going to an event at the 02 arena is perfect breakfast was better than most hotels i have stayed in very easy to get into central london using the thames clipper,1
 excellent breakfast ,1
 i have been paying for car parking 21 however the parking area not secure place my car some one been panting something beside passenger door it was annoyed me ,0
 did not compare to other certified 4 star hotels in london paid too much for what i got no front door just arriving from the back in a service elevator walk into passage with rooms no lobby miniature room wifi barely working person at reception told me to my face i can be glad they did not give my room away as i did not pay for it over booking com despite booking com confirming my booking towel was a face to towel this cannot be a certified 4 star place,0
 the friendly helpful welcome on arrival the magnificent and beautiful interior the fact that all the long corridors still retained their original arches and chandeliers the fact that the bedrooms retained their original high ceilings windows and deep skirting boards the luxurious and very tastefully beautiful choice of carpeting in the corridors the smart uniform of the staff ,1
 view from room of the london eye ,1
 i like the location safety of the hotel just in front of the sorbon university square ,1
 restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there very poor service ,0
 the pool was thilty and smelled funna the restrooms and lockerroom was horrific i aspected more and were really disapointed both at the room and hotel ,0
 the room was very quiet and contained everything necessary for a comfortable overnight stop ,1
 horrible service dirty room and rude staff ,0
 following a real comfy nights sleep a super choice for breakfast ,1
 stayed in mews 3 no heating in bathroom area and paint was flaking off of ceiling and walls only stayed one night so no opportunity to complain at time would not stay again ,0
 room a disgrace,0
 comfortable and spacious rooms with extremely helpful and pleasant staff the security of the guests is taken care of very well specially late at night when the staff never fails to check if you re an actual guest at the hotel but of course with great politeness ,1
 the car park was charged at 21 and it isn t even their car park they won t call u a cab u have to go out on the roadside and hale one my wife is in a wheelchair they were rude and disrespectful towards her,0
 room very small no air conditioning bathroom very very small and cramped with no ventilation shower basic and very cramped room very warm uncomfortable if weather is warm with very little ventilation their is a room fan but just circulating warmth around very expensive for price of room,0
 arrived to learn that they had let our double room go and instead had to settle for a twin rooms too hot stay was mid december and cramped no air conditioning working room and bathroom was grubby and out dated ,0
 current renovation activity is making the stay uncomfortable lifts are not efficient check out organisation was a real discomfort with lazy personnel while customers waiting current situation does not justify the applied rate very poor value for money ,0
 we booked stayed in executive room which was quite nice we were also shown the twin room but executive room is far superior spacious clean comfortable great location we used sofa cum bed as our second bed location is very good we stayed for 3 nights ,1
 our room was very small and there was a funny smell in the bathroom when we arrived like drains we reported the smell and this was fixed quite quickly although it did keep coming back during our stay our room was incredibly hot but we were unable to turn the radiator down on the second day of our stay there was no hot water so we had to keep boiling the kettle to fill up the bath with hot water the carpet along the side of the dressing table wasn t clean there was even a hair band on the floor left by a previous guest and the area behind the curtain was quite dirty as well ,0
 could not work the air con control and room was airless a poor nights sleep would not return ,0
 the comfortable beds spacious studio room were excellent bathroom kitchen facilities were handy too overall a great second stay ,1
 the room was very good for the price considering the quality of the linens and comfort of the bed also the cost of the breakfast was included and it was very copious with all the coffee we could possibly want and a very good selection of fruits yoghurt cereals breads pasties eggs among other offerings all included in the cost i booked on this site and got a very good rate for a triple room as we were traveling with a child very good location near the train station we were leaving the next day and overall good value for the money ,1
 staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy ,1
 the room and shower were tiny and almost no space which is not how the photos show it very disappointing for the price paid ,0
 a lovely victorian hotel with original features and very friendly staff very clean did the business for a short stay in london excellent nights sleep ,1
 loved that everything was as expected comfy everything great view of the sunset from window ,1
 very disappointing customer service and most importantly our room couldn t of been any more different to the photos online certainly not worth the money we paid ,0
 the bed is small might need to be expanded,1
 i have not seen a hilton with older carpeting and bathroom appliences yes everything is working but i didn t even want to shower in that bathroom i will not trust that this brandname will provide a standard to my accomodation anymore they charge your card rightaway with an additional daily extra 50 day which i think is rude and to prevent people from checking out the next morning ,0
 the bed was two singles put together terribly uncomfortable and hard the room had a musty smoke smell woke up with a headache room had aircon that made the smell worse it was stifling no oxygen circulating and seriously not healthy for anyone this hotel needs serious updating and restructuring adding new windows that can crack open in all rooms i will never stay here again i would get a refund if i could prefer to avoid the hassle i will always remember how annoyed i was that it was money not well spent ,0
 bedrooms are way too small also double beds of three quarter beds booking show you photographs for their larger rooms for their standard double rooms,0
 rooms are small and dirty ,0
 i loved the exterior and interior ,1
 staff was friendly when my sister in law and i found our twin room too tiny to move around in they accommodated us and gave us a bigger room after the first night our favorite part was the hot chocolate in the room and this electric tea pot that boiled water amazingly fast loved the free wifi too the hotel s location was close to subway stations too which was very nice ,1
 i had an item stolen from me brought it up with management they did get me stills from the camera which showed that i had with me on the day of leaving they did not handle the matter to my satisfaction they have promised to make my next stay better that s if i go back ,0
 great location good gym and got an upgrade thank you ,1
 room so small you couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the wardrobe no window in room very stuffy bed old and furniture dated room service knocked on door at 8 00am awful would never stay here again,0
 room was clean hotel has lots of character breakfast was good lots of selection left my smartphone in room on check out i was at airport before i noticed that it was missing staff found the phone and sent it to me thank you miles for your concern and prompt action ,1
 no problems what so ever perfect stay ,1
 dinner,0
 very modern great location,1
 they gave me a smaller suite i paid for a 6 personso suite it was very noisy after 11pm ,0
 excellent location to restaurants and metro,1
 i am waiting for a response to my claim for a refund,0
 no hot water in 2 rooms and for 2 mornings could not be a coincidence poor facilities basically on an highway so impossible to sleep if you are in one of the room facing the roads 20 min walk to closest tube station although advertised as being close to the tube not worth the money this is not a 4 stars hotel,0
 wonderful,1
 advertised modern rooms in the pictures but you actually get really old run down and smelly rooms that have not been refurbished for decades no free internet reception staff is annoying stupid and feel really important this place had its time in the 80s now it feels like a huge rip off i feel more comfortable in a cheap travelodge never again ,0
 the rooms were clean breakfast was a great variety and staff were very friendly ,1
 old dirty no heating no air con,0
 room amazing spar excellent views stunning,1
 kindly had the room upgraded hotel was in a brilliant location with easy access to all main attractions staff were extremely friendly and the latin quarter is unbelievably picturesque ,1
 every thing good,0
 friendly staff and clean hotel very characterful,1
 it s certainly not a four stars hotel only 90 minutes for breakfast late start at 7 30 and early finish at 9 00 without lift very small rooms poor staff ,0
 we stopped for the elo concert at the 02 arena i thought the short cut thru the hotel to the 02 was great and saved a good walk hotel was absolutely incredible and we would not esitate to use again if we stay in london again also the staff and concierge was extremely helpful really nice people ,1
 awesome comfortable room with good pillows and duvet good view over the pedestrian street below and very friendly and helpful staff,1
 room very cold as heating turned off at night bed uncomfortable poor standard of cleanliness dusty hair in shower drain ,0
 the breakfast was the best we have ever had all the staff were lovely ,1
 attitude of the staff regarding the problems we had in the hotel no hot water etc ,0
 breakfast was good room was spacious and nicely air conditioned ,1
 warning false advertising a double bed when they push two single beds together shower forces you to stand in the plughole and still miss most of the water as the shower head is fixed and pointed at the wall wish i had taken photos videos this is not even 3 star nevermind 5 ,0
 the modern bedrooms and traditional reception rooms made the hotel very welcoming ,1
 no ac travel with a 6 month old baby and was suffering our entire stay it was 37 degrees and no ac in the room no fan no help from stuff when we complain horrible,0
 cleanness friendly staff,1
 i have been stopping here on and off for the past couple of years faultless and extremely pleasant stay within easy reach of all the main tourist hot spots would definitely recommend if on a weekend break ,1
 the hotel room was tiny although it said it was for two people two of us couldn t fit in the room ,0
 everything dirty broken bath disgusting and that was with an upgrade ,0
 as it was a 5 wedding anniversary they kindly gave us a free upgrade to the executive suite with a bottle of wine and a card signed by the staff ,1
 waited 30 minutes to check in facilities on ground floor extremely crowded and run down ,0
 it s not like the pictures upon arriving there was confusion with payment that wasn t explained very well then we were sent down the the basement to our room which was cold dark and smelly not what we expected we were shown another room which was the same they wouldn t issue a refund back that night for us to go stay somewhere else the room we ended up in the beds small my feet hung over and i m 5ft 6 the view well there isn t one it s of a wall with kitchen fans outside which stink there was maintenance going on which we were unaware of we stayed in london 3 nights at 3 different hotels and this one was far the worse ,0
 dirty carpet and cobwebs on the ceiling the electricity cut out in the room for a bit we asked housekeeping to clean the cobwebs and nobody came,0
 noisy room with hotel aircon running into the night the room desk also had the end sawn off and a notch cut out of it carpet also missing in one corner next to the desk room decor was tatty with chips and over painting room cleanliness was also poor with dust and hair from previous occupants on light switches and beside table shelves hotel corridors also are tatty and have over painting and chips on walls not good enough imho for west london ,0
 bed was comfy and facilities were good the hotel is located in a good place just a 5 minutes walk to the station staff was very friendly and helped with luggages that we had ,1
 rooms were very noisy i moved rooms to a quieter room but it appeared the room was actually noisier due to the fan in the bathroom sounding like an aeroplane taking off there was no way of turning it off i kept the light off and the door closed but it kept me awake most of the night ,0
 we were in a area you didn t feel safe ,0
 some terrible staff who made me feel like something less than human ,0
 place in dire need of an upgrade decor and furnishings are all old creaking floor boards kept us up could hear neighbours sneeze ,0
 the shower was good but the shower curtain was rubbish the water leaked out the side of it onto the tiles the air conditioning system was not good it was noisy even when off the breakfast was 17 euros each for continental which is very expensive the bar was very small for a hotel and expensive ,0
 not clear about breakfast options that had been pre paid some guests had eggs for example no menu was provided to us quality very excellent french pastries was good though no plug in sink very annoying if for contact lens wearers ,0
 everything room with balcony was fantastic very helpful staff central for everything concierge was so helpful when we realised we had left clothing behind it was posted the very next da highly recommend this hotel it s fantastic,1
 the whole place is poor quality for the money,0
 convenience of location excellent size of room ,1
 good showers spotlessly clean clever interior design retaining original features mixed with modern art welcoming on arrival and pleasant staff ,1
 the staff are friendly and kindly to help our room is not in the basement and it s clean especially the bathroom which we care most briefly it s a good hotel in this price we ll choose to stay again next time ,1
 air conditioned and clean room seemed recently refurbished ,1
 great location close to the london eye right next to waterloo station family room was a good set up with different sleeping areas for us and the kids and kitchenette was useful overall a really good stay ,1
 the room is very small it is tiny it smells bad and not clean enough hospitality is low no free wifi at the room breakfast is poor i have stayed in better hotels in london at a better price it s quite disappointing ,0
 staying here helped us from feeling homesick way nicer than any holiday inn i ve stayed at in the states great rooms great staff amazing bathroom the location can t be beat either ,1
 no air conditioning in rooms when paying over 100 a night you would expect air con however the room did have a little fan to help blow the hot air around the room also i left some expensive items in the bathroom but when i called the next day the receptionist informed me nothing was handed in can t say surprised but very disappointed ,0
 poor staff that couldn t help me having to pay for the room before i checked out having a damp basement room that shouldn t have been rented out water stains on the ceiling,0
 everything,0
 we originally booked the executive suite but was upgraded to the penthouse suite free of charge had the most amazing view and could see all the way to wembley,1
 charming atmosphere in the panelled front room and theatre bar ,1
 i don t know if it was the sale price that gave me such a disappointing room but room 697 is the worst 4 star hotel room i have ever been to if i knew that room was going to be ready for me i wouldn t have booked,0
 category room the small double room check in date 2016 07 08 and check out date 2016 07 17 on saturday 8th of july 2016 we came to the hotel and noticed that our room is not like on the photo of the web site very small 7 9 q meters instead of 13 q m as mentioned in the official cite of mercure hotel and booking com as well at the toilet was smell sewage systems that make impossible to stay at this room we asked the reception to change the room but at the hotel weren t available free rooms the hotel did not try to solve our problem since 8th of july till the departure the reception did not help us anyway ,0
 all good business accommodation didn t stay around to find out much at the place ,1
 the bathroom facilities were not what you would expect for 4 accommodation the shower was like a public swimming pool shower complete with other people s hair and a funky smell there was also hair in the bed when i pulled back the duvet ,0
 selection for breakfast and gym,1
 noise from street and nightclub at end of corridor prevented sleep beds very uncomfortable,0
 i didn t like the fact that my partner accidentally left his bracelet on the side of the bathroom sink in plain view for all to see and when we returned to ask if it has been handed in it hadn t even though the room had been unoccupied since we had left at midday this meant the only people who had been in the room after us had been the cleaners or another member of staff we were outraged to find that a sentimental piece of jewlerry had actually been stolen by a member of hotel staff we are both disgusted with how this happened when you are supposed to be a reputable hotel we definitely will not be returning and certainly will not be recommending this thieving institute to anybody else ,0
 on the second night of my stay at the hotel the alarm went off in the hotel at around midnight all guests had to leave their rooms in complete darkness as the electricity switches had tripped ran in the dark with our pj s to the foyer as we thought the hotel was burning or even worse maybe a terrorist attack waited a whole hour and a half in the cold and dark before we were told that the smoke signal went off and that had triggerred the alarm and cut off the electricity supply only one hotel staff member was on duty to assist which he was unable to do we were locked out of our rooms we only got back to our rooms at 1 30 all we were told was that they were sorry no compensation or even a written apology from the hotel management quiet scary as the guy on duty did not have the situation under control no proper disaster management protocols are put into place pathetic for 5 star wonder how and who rates you 5 star ,0
 the room was very comfortable clean and quiet and well equipped with everything we needed ,1
 the views are outstanding on 18th floor cannot fault the intercontinental great experience perfect location for the o2,1
 the room was comfortable and was lucky enough to receive an upgrade the staff were friendly and approachable the service was prompt and professional ,1
 terrible view train track breakfast bad value for money pre booked breakfast when i reserved the room and paid for it but had to pay again as even though room was booked for 2 only one breakfast was reserved mini bar not stocked up as described overall staff very uncompassionate and unhelpful whole experience very very poor value for money a lot of construction work ongoing which should be advertised when booking as should views of train track big waste of 197,0
 the front office staff who checked us out 3 different rooms is not knowledgeable incapable in the individual billings i was charged twice to my credit card for one invoice fo staff needs training and be flexible to request for changes to names in the invoice ,0
 a boutique style hotel it had a lovely garden nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use complimentary fresh fruit plate for us the breakfast was superb gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates quiet location but within minutes of bustle ,1
 everything just perfect,1
 boutique atmosphere attentive staff,1
 the staff were very helpful and supportive specious room with new furniture ,1

 we loved the welcome that we received at the door and on reception we loved the room and the bathroom the spa was fantastic and the bar on the 18th floor is amazing the walkway to the o2 is a real bonus too the views from this hotel are outstanding floor to ceiling windows in the toilets so cool breakfast was absolutely amazing so much choice ,1
 the staff in reception were excellent helpful polite and went out of their way to make sure my husband and i had a wonderful overnight stay on our anniversary ,1
 very old hotel would need full refurbishing ,0
 front of house staff efficient and friendly room clean spacious and light microwave was great for heating a snack etc ,1
 for the 2 nights that we were in the hotel we had no water in either sink or shower we reported the issue but nothing was done i don t know were do they get the high rating from ,0
 staff were brilliant extremely friendly and very helpful room very quiet luxurious and spotless,1
 the staff couldn t be bothered to help our first encounter on entering the hotel was a young woman who said reception s not my job talk to him the second encounter was no better with the receptionist telling us his day was about to get better because his shift was nearly over he gave us 2 electronic keys and we had to ask where the room was because the receptionist hadn t said on entering the room a double accessible room we found the bed was pushed against the wall and was far from accessible there was mould growing on the walls the paper was hanging off the wall under the window and the carpet was frayed and dirty we returned to reception to ask if there was a more suitable room available and were told i am not authorised to move rooms you ll have to speak to the next person who come onto reception needless to say we were disappointed as this was a birthday treat and whilst we were not paying the full rate we would have expected better service from a mayfair hotel ,0
 reception staff house keeping entrance elevator bad treatment from the staff,0
 facilities comfortable good service,1
 loved the comfy bed had a great night sleep the staff were very friendly ,1
 small room bad pillows tiny bathroom extremely noisy from the street from the list of availabilities announced when booked the following were just missing tea coffee maker kitchenette free toiletries fan walk in closet soundproof toaster garden view cleaning products towels only one available for 2 people clothes rack toilet paper so d ont believe what they say in the booking document web site ,0
 noisy and cold hotel,0
 poor rooms and service,0
 all room was too small and dirty we had requested while booking 2 weeks before that we are travelling with small children and we need interconnecting rooms but on arrival the staff informed that interconnecting rooms are not available so we had to take two adjusant rooms and to our utter dismal in one of the rooms there were may white ants the first day we checked in when they changed the room after complain the new room was very far from our other room for kids and the staff informed that they cannot find any thing better the breakfast was very limited and repeated throughout our 4 days stay i must say that holiday inn standards have dropped and this hotel is over rated housekeeping was terrible housekeeping didn t bother to replace toiletries throughout our stay and never cleaned the carpet which was badly soiled it was terrible stay in a beautiful city ,0
 the main hotel was poor we stayed at 52 inverness place which was good the staff was excellent particularly the receptionist and porter ,1
 efficient,1
 thought i was paying for a room upgrade not just a bigger bed ,0
 rooms are small noisy u can hear next door people even if someone walking in the corridor food is not nice hotel is kinda old toilets are very small the room in the booking was saying 21 m2 but it was even less than 13 m2,0

 the hotel location is excellent it is super close to the paddington train and tube stations it is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy you walk three streets south and you are next to the hyde park kensington gardens gate i had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items my room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away ,1
 great stay superb location comfy beds good english breakfast friendly staff front desk ,1
 multiple issues two examples 1 the lock on the door did not work so i had to push the bed up against the door in the night whilst i slept on it to make sure no one came in 2 on the saturday afternoon i was there i came back in the middle of the day to be told i was not allowed in my room because members of staff were moving 3 large pieces of furniture through my room out into the garden my room had a door into the garden without gaining permission asking me if it was ok or even telling me this was going to happen when i asked if they could stop and carry out the moving of the furniture on sunday morning after i had vacated the room because i was in a rush they refused and said they would only be a few more minutes another 15 minutes past they left my room full of dirty foot prints on the floor and had moved many of my personal items to get out of the other door ,0

 all in all excellent value extremely polite and helpful staff very welcoming very comfortable and clean and tidy 5 star stay ,1
 first of all this is our honeymoon trip they had promised to gave us a bottle of champagne and free upgrade to a bigger room subject to availability but yet when we arrived the staff doesn t know about the champagne n yet no free upgrade after we used to bath robe the next day even they came and turn down they din even change the bath robe and somemore leave it in toilet it was wet and we can t use again pillow too soft neck stiff no tooth brush breakfast not much choice ,0

 the bed was definitely extra comfy slept like a baby the staff was friendly and helpful the printing center was also very convenient ,1
 convenient location perfect for our trip,1
 the bathroom was clean the 4 shower screen not a joke was hilarious and pointless and meant your shower contributed to a flooded floor each morning ,0
 location,1
 uncomfortable sofa bed no batteries in tv remote other didn t work cleanliness small thin scratchy towels light switch broken so bare wire no feedback from management when asked,0
 the hotel was disgusting the toilet smelt so bad it stunk out the whole room it was vile and there were no other rooms available so we had to stay in it the room was dirty and my pillow was covered in what looked like blood the staff were unhelpful and didn t seem to think it was an issue to sleep in a room that smelt like a sewer and was filthy ,0
 large bathroom with great elemis toiletries comfortable and king size bed,1
 location excellent and very convenient ,1
 quality value for money ,0
 horrible internet connection not very nice furniture old needs a makeover,0
 walking distance to the o2 excellent modern hotel staff very helpful great view from the bar of london,1
 the hotel is amazingly designed the walls and curtains are fluffy what more could you want the staff were all really helpful and friendly we woke up without hot water and they immediately upgraded us to a bigger room however they noticed the hot water issue was covering the full hotel which unfortunately they couldn t get fixed immediately on a saturday they offered all customers 30 of their booking back which was great ,1
 deal with staff was very good and very friendly,1
 the staff at the reception and the security were very pleasant when we arrived the housekeeping has been very helpful the location is a bit off from the center of paris but there are still a lot to see and we can have good meals at various restaurant at the bazaar ,1

 the staff were lovely and went the extra mile to welcome us they even sent a cake and birthday card to our room whilst we were out at a concert as the stay was part of our daughters 13th birthday celebrations breakfast was amazing too such a fabulous variety ,1
 location comfort and cleanliness,1
 room not ready on arrival dinner when delivered to the room was lukewarm drilling started in the room next door at 10 am without any warning ,0
 comfort location,1
 great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody ,1
 room wasn t clean bathroom was disgusting old furniture walls cracking bad paint look like they did a quick patch job on everything no heating at all and was very cold ,0
 when we entered our room just by the lifts we noticed that there were scuff marks around chips out of furniture paint etc but nothing too bad we also noticed that the coffee was plain nescafe very cheap instant coffee and whilst i am a coffee snob would have thought that as a four star hotel they would be inclined to provide something of a bit higher quality we had asked for an outside room and were warned the window was obscured to protect residents in the street behinds privacy so although an outside window no actual view nothing so far to really complain about we went out in the evening to a concert arriving back about 12 30 we both had a shower and pulled the bed sheets back to go to bed now about 1 am as we pulled the sheets back the top stuck to the bottom and there was chewing gum on the sheets we called reception and despite explaining the problem they sent a night worker up with a single sheet he went away and came back and changed the sheets now about 1 30 we waited in our bathrobes for him to change the sheets a very uncomfortable embarrassing experience but it was done and now very tired we went to bed the room has an obscured window between the bathroom and the bedroom so this means in the daytime you can see each others outline in each room but in the night if you need to use the bathroom and turn the light on you wake the person sleeping we were also woken by people outside the room waiting for the lift when it came to checkout i was expecting some form of apology or compensation for the chewing gum on the bedsheets on the first night this was not offered and we had to explain what the problems had been we asked for a refund for the first night that we stayed and the receptionist said she was unable to offer this but would wipe the bar bill one cup of tea one cup of coffee and one croissant to compensate us this was completely unacceptable to use ,0
 we checked in late after a long flight but we re not given a room in the london city suits building but in the brewery side of the montcalm opposite this is not good at anytime with luggage given the layout of the hotel where lots of stairs cannot be avoided then to get into a room with a large open window to the bathroom without a functioning blind we had to be moved to another wing of the hotel it was late and involved even more stairs before getting to our room which was still not on the side of the hotel originally booked the morning was even worse with an early start heavy suitcases to drag up and down stairs as you couldn t take lifts all of which was before even continental breakfast was available in the restaurant annoyingly for me this was a generally poor experience and not 5 star as advertised ,0
 very comfortable bed nice breakfast very friendly staff convinient location,1
 whiskey,1
 the receptionist was really nice and friendly had an upgraded room location was great price expensive as per all of london executive room was nice wasn t reasonable food breakfast ,1
 there were lots of mice running about in the bar dining area when reported to the member of staff he laughed it off as if it wasn t an issue i then reported it to the lady in reception when i was checking out she apologised and said she would report it to her manager she thanked me for bringing it to her attention and said they were unaware of the problem i told her they were aware of the problem has there were reviews on trip advisor that mentioned the mice she then became a little embarrassed and wished me a good day i left and won t be returning ,0
 variety,1
 the toilets are very small the rooms and corridors are very small ,0
 the bed was extremely comfortable and the spa facilities were perfect we had breakfast brought to our room bang on the time requested such a large breakfast well worth it,1
 no mini bar in the room no brush teeth the most inportent people they dont stop nok the door for check out from 9am till 12 to insure that we ate linving,0
 nice rooms and modern place,1
 london had 25 degrees and the aircon in my room only made the room cool down to 23 degrees expect more for the price i paid long wait at check in and when i finally got to my room the key did not work also the room floors smell of mold mold smell that sticks to the clothes ,0
 hotel building had great character and friendly and helpful staff ,1
 bad location long way to walk to nearest tube marble arch breakfast not included and expensive not free wifi in the room asked for upper stories room but was placed at first floor lots of noise from event rooms at ground floor would not recommend this hotel ,0
 everything travellers can pick this hotel only for location nothing else donot want to go in details but i had very bad experience in general,0
 the space is good for a family of 4 the bathroom is clean with all required supplies there is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron ,1
 small room with very bad soundproofing we were able to hear the conversations happening in the corridor or even in the room next to us we had neighbours very noisy there was no system of air circulation but a small window that could be opened only for a few centimeters breakfast is not worth its price for the same place you can have good quality food outside a fews blocks from the hotel bread and viennoiserie were dry not many choice there is a heating issue room was cold but corridor very hot should fix that,0
 the location was good and the accommodation very comfortable,1
 the room was incredibly small despite asking for a long bed if possible i am 6feet 6 inches tall could not turn around in the room,0
 room service bad food ,0
 the breakfast is not good and they ask extra charge for omelet egg the towels are old not clean and tattered housekeeping very bad old furniture,0
 everything was perfect the room was large and quite the bed very comfortable you can walk to the hotel from st pancras station no need to take a taxi ,1
 the view of the 02 and river from my room was amazing ,1
 the room was awful no window tiny light from the hall coming in no sockets hair dryer broken,0
 definitely not worth 4 5 stars the rooms were tiny and very dark the bathroom had sticky floors and it was just a nightmare i think everyone books this hotel because of the 4 5 stars but their rating is sooo high because only 4 people have rated them and that s what mislead us def not worth 200 a night never ever again ,0
 very clise to tube great breakfast very clean and amenable ,1
 rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room on asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid i would expect to pay in a yha but not in a hotel of this standard ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have i had to pay in advance ,0
 i had to change room as the carpets filthy only to change to another room where the carpets were also very stained the whole room appear tired and dated and not very clean the sheets also had a few stains on them the service lacked any real enthusiasm and very long wait to check in would not recommend this hotel at all ,0
 i had booked a superior room etc i got a disabled room with bad shower drainage and poor facilities also restaurant is really a football pub with loud music and poor dining experience many better choices same area ,0
 there s stink smell when i open the bathroom door the room was small with bad view,0
 room very small not a 4 stars confort,0
 the staff were very helpful and friendly great location and handy for underground ,1
 service was excellent from the start great location and central to everything the underground is around the corner breakfast was good with a variety to choose from comfortable beds and nice view from room ,1
 the reception staff was extremely rude and could not speak english properly the staff made up a story that i used vulgar language which was a lie i then asked for the manager who corrected the situation this occurred the first time at reception on check in but the next day i was complaining about the bar staff attitude and again the staff made up a story that i used vulgar language the staff at this hotel clearly lie and accuse guests of things which are not true i will be taking these accusations up to the owners of the hotel the hotel was smelly with smoking smells they are a lot of hidden charges that was very surprising there is also no doorman you also have to pay for wi fi ,0
 i didnt like the 13inch tv from 1997 the bed comfort was stiff the room service was awful i had 1 bite and didnt eat the rest i then informed the from of desk staff and still had to pay 21 for a club sandwich and some cold wings ,0
 the whole experience is bad ,0
 staff where rude the room was dirty and in a very tied state stains of the carpets and chairs beds where cheap and uncomfortable breakfast was not worth 13 biggest waste of money do not stay here,0
 a long way out of london cbd its an old pub and typical pub rooms its on a very budy road and you get lots of traffic noise windows are old and not double glazzed tiny tv its a last resort place to stay ,0
 definitely not a 4 star hotel i d say 3 stars very well located rooms are small and a little old room i was staying at didn t even have a shower small bath tub a normal person can t fit in breakfast was average only worth it if already included bed was very comfortable and staff was nice ,1
 shower was cramped bedroom small but clean wasn t a nice location but very close to the metro though when there i was surrounded by unsavoury characters trying to sell me what looked like fake metro tickets ,0
 first class service a great location magnificent boutique property and very thoughtful personal touches during our stay ,1
 the property has limited check in space rooms were very small the cleaning staff knocked on the door five 5 times starting at 9am when check out is at 12 noon had to tell them every time that check out is not until 12 it wasn t a good experience as i was suffering from jet lag and really needed the rest limited amenities,0
 i booked a room with 25 square meters for 3 days when i got to the hotel at night they told me i was upgraded to suite for free however i didn t go paris for work no one would visit us i don t need the living room in the suite the bedroom is extremly samll and very uncomfortable but it was too late at that time what i need was to sleep asap next day when i came back to hotel from a tired trip in the city i asked them to change my room they told me it s too late and suggested me to change for the last day and the last day they did change for me but it was just room with 20 squaremeters and surprisely they overcharged me when i checkout i would like fight against them but the flight wouldn t wait this is the worst experience of my trip in paris becareful about this hotel ,0
 they are talkin to us like tge wanna kik us out,0
 small room ,0
 the fact that they immediately block money off your account although site said no money will be taken and pay at the property plus charging you at the hotel again and after numerous calls they are yet to release blocked funds room was also small although i was supposedly updated ,0
 terrible front desk service reserved and blocked more than what cost of accommodation was,0
 the staff in the reception was really in bad mood a guy tried to ask one of the staff and he said wait i m busy now how they can speak like that with a gust even if the price is very good but i want to pay more and get better service than this hotel ,0
 i liked the new look of room and would love to be able to get another night free from this wonderful comment ps don t forget to smile ,1
 loved the sky bar the range of whiskys were superb the french waiter new his stuff fair play ,1

 rooms ridiculously too small airconditioner not working poor water pressure in shower,0
 is this hotel rated 4 they put us opposite the lift and it was too noisy going up and down the small balcony is full of people talking and can see them outside our window which is just a meter away and it was past midnight and we could not even sleep the room is jam packed with furniture and no enough space to walk around but oblige to sit in bed end up leaving the hotel too early ,0
 bed was amazing great nights sleep warm room quiet and clean shower fab julia at front desk was extremely helpful kind foyer is welcoming but waiting to be seen at checking in was very hit miss hard to know where to stand ,1
 the room is quite small please be aware of it before you make the reservation,0
 wonderful location for the 02 easy access to the cable car and river clippers very friendly and knowledgeable staff the hotel was immaculately clean room was spacious breakfast was included with our room and there was every item imaginable available we only stayed one night but wished it could have been longer it was a lovely break and hope to stay again ,1
 location staff,1

 rooms nice and comfortable a little compact however ,1
 the room they gave me 104 very small and have 5 stairs between the bathroom and the bed it should not be used and kept as storage they changed the room the second dayafter i told them i will leave ,0
 we love everything about the hotel george the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 i think that speaks for itself ,1

 they have to try to deal more professionally with guests,0
 tv was not working properly telephone was not working the room is smaller than i thought it would be ,0
 i was given a room at the basement which was too noisy i was told that another room would be available for me the following day but this never happened the wi fi signal was extremely poor overall during my stay i did not feel like staying in a 4 star hotel and i would definitely not recommend it to anyone utter disappointment and a waste of money ,0
 as mentioned in my booking i had booked this hotel as i was celebrating my girlfriends birthday as a surprise although check in was at 3pm we arrived at 12pm to drop our bags off i managed to check in also at the reception desk the member of staff i checked in with confirmed i had a non smoking room and that she was going to check to see if my room was ready she told me it wasn t and so therefore i could come back later to pick up the room keys from reception we the left the hotel as we had a show to attend to and some shopping to do we arrived back at the hotel just after 6pm i went back to reception to pick up the room keys only to be told the room was not ready and they only room they had was a smoking room or an accessibility room obviously i was extremely annoyed as this contradicted what was said to me earlier i was then told that if i wanted a non smoking room i would have to wait half hour or so as i had already made reservations for drinks and dinner elsewhere we were struggling for time so i had no choice but accept the smoking room as a good will gesture the only thing i was offered was free wifi which did not work at all we got to our room which smelt horrendous and had dirt all up the walls and the carpet not to mention a tv that only had 4 working channels that were all in a different language the room we were given was on the first floor and the noise coming from the cars on the street below was so loud we hardly slept all night i complained about the tv a gentleman arrived about 20 minutes later to have a look he could speak any english but all he could say is that the to was broken i could of told him that myself he said their was nothing he could do and left all in all an awful hotel unhelpful staff massive queues in reception and disgusting rooms will never stay their again and would not reccomend this hotel ,0
 very old hotel bad service bad smell smoking rooms make the whole place stink of cigarettes the disgusting smell of kitchen in the lobby ,0

 conveniently located close to bus and tube lines comfortable room with a modern bathroom and view of the square busy but relaxing public spaces with grand victorian lobby friendly and helpful staff ,1
 extremely comfortable beds luxurious rooms very helpful staff ,1
 room was far too small shower too weak not value for money coffee too weak ,0
 all excellent,1
 bedroom size was disappointing and general cleanliness of room showed a lot of shortcomings ,0
 interesting hotel with a history of it having being a wealthy occupancy over the past decades the lovely unaltered appearance of victorian era as approaching the entrance and within to the reception area door staff to welcome you in politely and with its own mini private theatre now a small busy and comfortable bar but retaining the unchanged decor of that period we had a small bedroom but clean and as we were only sleeping it was adequate staff were very polite helpful and as we observed very patient good position with tube station very close queensway hyde park opposite which is always a lovely walk through for landmarks ie kensington palace serpentine diana memorial water feature nearby restaurants with many tastes catered for good choice in london ,1
 we got a little room with a real dirty carpet no coffee maker and with furnitures showing major signs of wear and tear after complaint we received a different room still small but renovated the hotel is in the process to be renovated will last till 2017 the breakfast area breakfast offered for 25 each located in a corner of the lobby w o daylight the hotel is rated as 4 star we really expected much more for the money ,0
 matresses toilets door locks verrrryyy old curtain rod fell with the curtain,0
 the staff could have spoken and understood english better i lost count of how many times i asked for a childs bed in one of the rooms and we still didn t get one shower was dreadful,0

 the beds were comfy facilities in the room were good room service was excellent very delicious and quick central location ,1
 no lift so impractical for older clients with luggage booking com clients may be given inferior rooms very busy road 24 hour heavy traffic very noisy towels too small not proper bath towels not a hotel but a b b guest house,0
 the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean with good towels ,1

 other guests luggage was still in my room when i checked in rooms looked old and tired bed was not clean stains on sheets not worth the money i paid not the room in the pictures i ended up with a really small room at the top,0
 bad serviced asked 4 times for additional blanket and shampoo for 2 days noisy rooms near the road you can here every car inside the room noisy water pipes from other rooms wake you at nights the stuff is friendly and tries to be helpful but we had very poor sleep and payed relevantly more than other claimed 4 star hotels we travel allot never had such disappointment ,0
 great stay at an amazing hotel staff polite and helpful check in and out smooth it was my partners birthday and the staff left a cake and balloons in the room which was a nice touch sky top bar was excellent room service was prompt and delicious ,1
 very dirty cleaners don t clean walls too thin you can hear people having sex like they are with you in the same bed staff are very unhelpful,0
 it is beautiful looking hotel fantastic staircase comfortable bar lounge the staff were all really pleasant and helpful from the minute we arrived at reception to collecting our bags when leaving ,1
 staff were excellent very attentive ,1
 the room and view the friendly greet at reception the complimentary bottle of wine and hand signed bday card for my misses the fact that the room had a great view really made our weekend i can t thank the lovely lady on reception ebough genuinely freindly and profesional ,1
 overall service was excellent couldn t do enough to serve your stay the breakfast selection was very good and all at a high standard ,1
 clean room good breakfast and near to trainstation,1
 televison didn t work some sockets wouldn t take plugs river view was actually of a car park main light in room wouldn t work,0
 awful hotel certainly not 4 as we were led to believe our friends had a room with step down to the room as soon as you entered the room it was dark and no notice of steps he walked in with his case and promptly fell down the flight of steps breaking his ankle in two places ruined our weekend in london needless to say a long period of recovery for our friend hotel staff uninterested when asked for first aider they gave us savlon asked to speak to manager no manager or deputy on site rooms were disgusting thread bare stained carpets electrics for shaving point hanging off in bathroom light switch by bed missing front cover curtain rail just about hanging on if i was booking com i would remove them from my list of hotels and we normally use booking com for most of our trips but would not be happy to see this hotel recommended to anyone apart from anything else it is dangerous ,0
 too small room water was too hot and i couldnt control for shower,0
 n a,0
 the staff could be friendlier and more helpful especially the front desk staff they were the worst and the cleaning people seemed nice enough but nobody spoke english so getting an iron board was a challenge ,0
 no air con no bar tiny room,0
 no mini bar 24 hour room service is basically garage sandwich s bed uncomfortable pillows are like rock,0
 the bath was so relaxing and having the television in the bathroom meant to didn t have to watch the cricket we enjoyed a wide selection of drinks in the bar and spent the following morning in the swimming pool which warmed up once we d been in a few minutes the staff were lovely and we felt spoilt from the moment we walked through the doors ,1
 staff were friendly and great location especially for the price ,1
 location was excellent of the apollo,1
 very sullen staff both at reception on arrival and departure and on phone answered with a curt oui not even hello no smiles from anyone in the room not much space noisy air conditioning no bath tub and basic amenities eg no soap in shower despite online description of top quality hotel the balcony was just a dirty piece of concrete i left room service breakfast request outside my door in good time but they forgot to collect it so no breakfast arrived no apology offered atmosphere depressing ,0
 staff were absolutely amazing i really felt that i had landed in a foreign holiday country big compliment from me ,1
 there was construction going on from 8am so don t expect a lie in we were told breakfast was on until10 30 which it was not and we missed it even though we had paid due to the construction the lifts were out of order therefore being on the fourth floor we had to use the staff lifts which came out to a aged staff sink which was leaking the hall way was old and dated i e the paint was peeling off the room door the water was turned off in the morning whilst in the shower was unable to finish showering or brush our teeth we weren t notified of this no concierge offered very unhappy with our experience you could get a better experience elsewhere for this price i e travelodge,0
 staff was very friendly location was excellent rooms were spacious for london standards good gym service was very good ,1
 the first impression you get when you just enter into the hotel that it cannot be a hotel the chain of best western is not the luxury in the world but you still expect for some standards the bed size is so called full smaller than 140 cm for sure the linen is not so fresh the reception is tiny and small room full with some suspicious people though it s located in relative central location the metro availability is bad 2 lines available only in the bottom line never back ,0
 room was essentially a cupboard with a double bed in it not even enough space to unpack a suitcase when opening the door immediately ahve to desecend several steep steps into said cupboard room very worn with parts of bathroom broken,0
 when i checked in they give rooms different than what i booked in booking com,0
 room too hot and unable to sleep,0
 staff was very less and very unresponsive and overburdened don t expect any room service or answer to your queries there is nothing welcoming about this hotel so don t go for it ,0
 the bed was very comfy and i love the speakers in the shower from the tele was all connected and the views were spectacular,1
 lovely bar area good breakfast selection upgraded to exec room which was good ,1
 nice decor and good size rooms with comfy bar area,1
 quality of room room was dark and drafty in the cellar bathroom showed fungus in the wall tub old shabby and destroyed ,0
 amazing views staff very helpful fully equipped facilities from gym to bar so whether you are staying for business or pleasure all your needs are taken care of,1
 small room noisy thin pillows so i had neck pain the next day dirty carpet ,0
 had to wait 1 5hrs even though we reached exactly at the check in time air conditioner was not working had a brick wall view ,0
 toilett flush from 18th century didn t work properly tiny room with old windows we could barely open breakfast was huge chaos had to queue for buffet forever food laying around on floors waiters filled up containers with food on regular already used plates about 15 empty juice bottles on the bar left no more juice for us we arrived ad 9 45 on subday morning our table didn t get cleaned in betweeen so we sat there for over an hour with our used dishes that s not a relaxed sunday morning breakfast no porridge musli only available upon request they are charging gbp 19 if you have breakfast extra not sure what for luggage was stored in a meeting room downstairs unlocked we had to go in and search by ourselfs ,0
 loved the shower and bed ,1
 i couldn t get wifi in my room and when asked reception about it i was handed a password code that should of been given to me when i booked in as standard the cleaner was cleaning the pool area from the day before whilst my child and i were in the pool at 7 15 had to tell a fellow guest to shower off before getting in should be more notices up maybe in the rooms ,0
 fantastic friendly staff made it very easy for us to have a great time i would go there again ,1
 nice view,1
 staff were superb we didn t meet a bad person all week lots of choice for breakfast the room was more than adequate for our needs if i m a bit picky a spruce up with a paint brush wouldn t have gone a miss and we loved the building the location was spot on for us too and would like to stay at this hotel for all of our london visits in the years to come thank you ,1
 the rooms should have been cleaned each day,0
 pretty bad experience cab that was called to take us to gatwick was the hotels preferred cab company and overcharged us thief would be too kind for this cab driver ,0
 amazing hotel ,1
 the hotel has been revamped and there is a vast improvement ,1
 i booked the room through booking com but when we arrived the lady at the front desk said for the price i paid on this site we d have a room with no windows they offered an upgrade to a superior double room with king size bed on the top floor for 30 the only truth in the upgrade was the top floor bit the bed was smaller than a standard double there were flies in the room and was not superior to anything i spoke to the manager about the problems and he offered a room change we d already unpacked and got as settled as we could so all i wanted was the upgrade money back that didn t happen the breakfast the next morning was not worth the 10 each the bacon was like cardboard the eggs didn t taste right and the whole breakfast was a huge let down so the price started on here as 73 i ended up paying 150 which included 24hr parking the upgrade and breakfast for 2 not impressed with any of it a premier inn would have been the better option ,0
 they have smartphones with internet and phone calls in each room available for customer to take with them while going around the city perfect for maps looking up to places and restaurantes also free of charge ,1
 everything fantastic hotel in a prime location staff very friendly and wonderful room ,1
 the hotel was under renovation and we were not inform of this no access to club lounge woken early each morning by builders banging and crash about the bathroom was falling to pieces and mouldy plus shower head unstable and not fit for use water was spraying everywhere very limited wardrobe space not enough for two adults fridge broken iron facilities rubbish we had a club room and expected much more and in reality it was very basic double room zero room service had to get take away from outside each day few freebies of an apple and orange does not make it a club room and 4 star hotel ,0
 busy hotel dirty carpet in room water damage in flooring in shower room staff were very unfriendly meals expensive,0
 the location was great for our trip we wanted to visit lings college london on the strand theatre land and oxford street they were all within walking dustance ,1
 car park was broken so had to walk away to get to the car food and drink very expensive even at london prices 13 quid for 2 drinks no close tube,0
 old not clean need urgent refreshment ,0
 i booked for 3 guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for 1 person when explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately she would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and i received was one of the worst i have ever experienced i would never stay here again and i would not advise anyone else to stay here ,0
 room was very comfortable,1
 close to restaurants and shopping for travel needs a bit of a walk from paddington so took a short taxi ride with the bags quiet nice breakfast and very friendly staff ,1
 the room wasn t really a room more like a cupboard the door couldn t open properly because the furniture a bed a chair and a desk that had been crammed into the cupboard in a desperate attempt to make it pass as a room took up the entire floor space there was no space for me to put down my bag other than on the chair and that left nowhere for me to sit or stand other than on the bed i felt quite literally like i was a child hiding in a store room meanwhile the hotel staff told me there was no way to change rooms having already paid for my two night stay i felt compelled to make the most out of it but i should have just left i slept reasonably well but slipped into depression the claustrophobia anxiety that i didn t have adequate accommodation when i was supposed to be enjoying myself in town and lack of self worth to be accepting a cupboard as my dwelling added up to an oppressive wall of negative feelings surely only ordinarily experienced by the homeless i bit the bullet and paid for a second hotel after the first night i simply left and never went back my advice to others is to pay a few extra pounds at a hotel where you actually get a room instead of being crammed into a storage space like a pile of unwanted linen ,0
 the hotel,0
 the hotel architecture and interior desing,1
 very small size the double room and had have hard time to stay 3 night in three bedrooms room sizes are small not good for two people stay in these rooms me and my family was not happy about everything in this hotel ,0

 the staff made us feel welcome and valued immediately were given upgrade and complementary breakfasts due to maintenance work room was immaculate and very comfortable very close to underground and hyde park would stay here again ,1

 the staff were very attentive the facilities were superb the decor and cleanliness were excellent the location perfect ,1
 unmade room fire alarm going off because of hotel error at 11 pm utter chaos with no staff organisation at all would not come again or recommend this place ,0
 the staff was unhelp full the resrvation was made for two single beds but they give one small queens size bed and when we aske to change they says we are full and they charge the full amount i will not recomend this hotel ,0
 i liked nothing it took 3 hours to check in because the rooms were not ready at check in time of 2pm we arrived at 3pm the hotel was dirty the one room we were given initially had not been cleaned and had hair in the bed and shower filthy corridor to rooms so many problems on check out taking a long time because they tried to charge us for extra breakfasts eaten in the restaurant which we did not and had ordered room service a shambles and will never and tell all my colleagues and friends to never book this hotel appalling value for money ,0
 mr mossani in reception was very helpful god bless him ,1
 reception and concierge staff very helpful and polite,1
 well almost everything we have been staying in this hotel at least 6 times last year at the beginning everything was perfect they were giving big and clean rooms then ofcourse everything changed last time i asked from them in my reservation higher floor quite room street view and operable window because need fresh air for my allergies but they gave 1 st floor backside room connected room noisy very small when asked a new room after 1 day they had to give us a better one this we went again and despite everything wrote in reservation they again gave us connection noisy 1 floor not operable window room can you believe that and when rejected they told me they can not see what am writing at booking com so let me warn you location is good but after they got you the money you paid for this hotel it does not worth we will never go again we have stayed once in every 2 month and they did this to us i made superior double room reservation and the bed they gave to us is double bed not king size we couldn t fit to bed don t go you will regret to pay that much we paid 140 per day and look how much am writing sorry but big disappointment they should refund us because f this scum ,0

 the size of the room was totally unacceptable for one adult and a child i have never stayed in a room so small and what they charge for it absolutely disgraceful ,0
 the hotel is currently converting to a different brand from holiday inn and construction was going on although they did warn me of this in advance 12 minute walk to the kings cross area and st pancras train station too soon to give a true evaluation staff was great ,1

 although the room was a bit small but for paris standards it was fine we were very comfortable the room was clean with a very comfortable bed and a nice bathroom the breakfast was also great fresh squeezed orange juice hot food french pastries bread and more we have nothing but praise for this hotel ,1
 all the rest,0
 the actual hotel is beautiful the room was large and very comfortable the staff bent over backwards to make your stay memorable nothing was too hard for them the breakfast was plenty full and very tasty breakfast in your room is even more special and only 5 tray charge which is excellent there was everything in your room that you needed for your stay i can t think of one thing that could be missing or needed it was very clean loved it loved the touch of smoking area on 18th floor as far as i can see i can t find anything else that would be needed to make the hotel a huge success ,1
 perfect location as i was taking my daughter for a birthday treat to the 02 access to the arena was easily accessible from the hotel which was fabulous hotel was really comfortable the staff were extremely helpful especially graham the doorman who greeted us on arrival and was there to say goodbye ,1
 very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys only a short walk to nearest subway nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff nice breakfast restaurant will come back again ,1
 no complaints,1
 nousy room in the basement despite had requested as preference in the booking reservation an upper floor and quite room breakfast very poor with cheap industrial products,0
 the room was pokey smelt of food from the kitchen close by it was noisy all night because of a generator type noise and we were in the basement it felt like we were in a cell with no natural light can t believe i paid 200 for such a crap room we stayed in a best western the week before and paid 100 and it was amazing in comparison ,0
 location was good and staff attentive,1
 4 stars and 300 for a tiny room and very bad breakfast do not recommend ,0
 no hot water in morning soundproofing between us and next room was a locked partition door we could hear their conversations and other noises ,0
 the twin room was tiny and lacked any warmth there wasn t even a print or picture to lift the non discript cream walls you had to chase round the droplets of water coming from the shower head to get wet there was a mini bar with nothing in it there was no bar in the hotel there was no iron in the room walls paper thin couldn t sleep with the excertions from next door breakfast was very poor coffee from a machine in france 4 star no way basic 2 3 star at most ,0
 really nice building and location ,1
 good hotel in excellent location for transport access good meals too ,1
 very welcoming staff on reception and able to open windows in room for some fresh air ,1
 good location near to train and underground train ,1
 great rooms friendly helpful staff ,1
 in midnight elevator the door opened is concrete wall we really scared ,0
 food that we chose was not well cooked and nothing was done to compensate this shower doors were too small no parking for disabled people and the room was much too small for the price charged,0
 staff room condition,0
 staff were friendly and were available when we required them the room was vert comfortable ,1
 very friendly staff liked the premises and location very clean enjoyed the quaint bar,1
 the staff were super rude and not helpful at all half of the things in the room didn t work airconditioner fridge microwave when we asked the staff to get them fixed they were pretty nonchalant about it and didn t really sound that interested in it eventually ofcourse nothing got fixed also please note that you ll be staying at the very edge of paris in an area full of drug addicts and some other unpleasant creatures better get a room in the centre if you can afford it ,0
 laundry facilities were excellent for people travelling our rooms were ideal for friends sharing ,1
 the room was very small even for one person bathroom was dirty of beeing used for years towels were not fresh carpet was dirty and my single room s location was awful fire alarm turned on in the morning i was freaked out had to run out with all other visitors who gave 4 stars for this never again ,0
 really needs tlc coat of paint wouldn t good a miss smelt unpleasant,0
 location was perfect short walk from westminster great small restaurants and grocery shops nearby this place was a lifesaver after a dodgy previous hotel and they gave us a free upgrade ,1
 the room looks like a cubicle with no forniture at all and no space for a bag ,0
 the room was very old fashioned ,0
 i found a mouse in my room and received little to no compensation for that inconvenience even after i showed them video evidence daily house keeping services knocked 4 times thought out one morning and afternoon despite the do not disturb sign internet and breakfast were extra daily charges internet was very laggy and the service at breakfast was non existent ,0
 the marble staircase and architecture also the christmas decorations ,1
 really small room breakfast buffet not exactly overwhelming but location perfect and hotel in general extremely stylish nice staff ,1
 everything about this hotel was excellent their is not a bad thing i could say the staff the room the location everything was excellent and best of all the price we paid was very value for money i cant wait to go back the next time we come to london we would pick this hotel again ,1
 the staff at breakfast were not welcoming and did not provide a good service the waitress took our breakfast to the wrong table this was after a 15 minute wait fir breakfast plus 10 minutes waiting for someone to take out order she left the dining area realised her mistake came back picked up the breakfasts from the confused couple and tried serving the same plates to us no acknowledgment that our breakfasts had been sat at the wrong table for 5 minutes with the couple already having used their cutlery and started the rooms were small and poor carpet we had water seeping through the bathroom shower area to the bedroom carpet ,0
 historical hotel conveniently situated in the centre of london ,1
 good service good location good breakfast ,1
 no hot water in the room this is just unacceptable,0
 i checked in at 8 30pm and when entering the room assigned to me i had a major shock it stank like horrible garbage and there was a pair of men s shoes on the floor i got scared and was confused whether or not there is someone in the room and was afraid to enter after looking around for one more second i saw a bag standing on the bed as well so ran out of the room down to the reception which cannot even be called a reception but a desk with some employee when explaining that there is someone in my room and that i was so scared and need to be given another room the employee did not even apologize to me and started calling his manager on the phone after 30mins of waiting i was assigned another room and given breakfast for free as a compensation for the trouble at least this room was not occupied and didn t stink however cleanliness was questionable the drain in the shower was full of black hair and clogged the window didn t close properly and was hence super noisy in the room as it was facing the train station the pillows were stained as well overall it was my worst stay ever in paris where i come at least 2 3 times a year and stay in different hotels in the same price range every time i will definitely never return and can for sure say that this is not a 4star hotel and certainly not worth the 280 a night a total rip off if you have the choice do not stay here there is 100 better hotels for this price i only stayed there because all of the hotels in paris were unfortunately booked out ,0
 the worst room i ve ever had in paris dirty tiles in bathroom were falling off bugs in the tub water damage on the ceiling and outside our room dirty walls absolutely gross and overpriced the staff was rude and downright mean i would never stay here again and advise everyone to steer clear of this tourist trap i come to paris multiple times a year there are so many wonderful hotels for the same price point where the staff is actually lovely and helpful avoid at all costs do not eat the breakfast just gross all around ,0
 the room smelled of mould the shower tray was damaged and dirty staff were advised but couldn t change our room there was a gap in the staircase very dangerous,0
 expensive old furniture small room stuff on reception not care about you stay or request,0
 location and the very friendly staff,1
 everything was grate,1
 the location was great for trips to the museums ,1
 after having a mix up issue in which i booked the hotel for the same day when i meant to book it for the month after for my girlfriends birthday i decided to call the hotel in hopes of them being able to change the dates of my stay they told me this was not possible and blamed the policy of booking com even though after speaking with a representative of booking com myself who called the hotel and was told they would not allow me to change the dates they then told me to call in the morning when i told them i was a student and this was for my girlfriend however i know it was just an excuse to make sure the time passed and i came up as a no show on their accounts and was charged anyway i was told basically to jog on in the morning and am now 150 down because of it absolute scam ,0
 the room was great heated bathroom floor and extremely clean and comfortable perfect for a couple of days in london ,1
 bad facilities especially the bed make us sleepless we live in a dirty room with old carpet and furnutures not the standart of mercury never live in here ,0
 the location was good for us close to the latin quarter,1
 clean tidy good value for money would stay again,1
 the hotel was located in a rough area the first day we walked outside to get food as the hotel had no restaurant and we had stuff thrown at us we were recorded and had people shout things at us all within a few steps away from the hotel there is a metro station about 5 minutes away from the hotel but we were unable to use it as it was too dangerous to walk we ended up using uber s to and from the hotel and even the drivers were reluncant to drive here and had a few drivers cancel on us because of this the drivers that did pick us up all told us not to stay out late and get back and stay in the hotel room really wouldn t recommend the hotel to anyone especially tourists of family s and groups of young girls the location of the hotel did ruin our trip as we couldn t stay out late because of how bad the area was meaning we were back by our hotel at 7 every night there is meant to be a super market near by but every time we tried to find it someone would make us feel uncomfortable so we had to go back to the hotel the hotel it s self was nice the staff were okay and rooms were really nice however drivers told us this hotel is used for prostitution so really wouldn t recommend to families ,0
 very clean and tidy rooms emasculate and very comfortable food was good,1
 every thing expansive room is dark no refrigerator the bathroom door is very old and locked us inside many times my mistake is i paid for my whole stay in advance ,0
 the rooms are tired and dingy rooms are in desperate need of updating ,0
 well the staff were quite rude they got my information wrong and even told my girlfriend what i had ordered when it was meant to be a surprise food was cold morning and night and was interrupted twice by staff,0
 it was my daughters birthday there was cake gifts a card awaiting us in our room situated opposite a lovely park staff very nice smiley well worth a visit christmas tree was lovely ,1
 rooms lovely and tastefully decorated staff very friendly and helpful and breakfast was super ,1
 location and price was good ,1
 room was too small bathroom was very compact,0

 great staff wonderful historic hotel in a perfect location comfortable room ,1
 wonderfulf peaceful location literally round the corner from trafalgar square friendly welcoming and efficient staff everything ,1
 lovely room got a free room upgrade when we checked in,1
 very friendly and helpful staff,1
 the room was too small ,0
 absolutely loved our stay staff couldn t have been more helpful and we were even upgraded to a penthouse suite free of charge highly recommended,1
 it was too noisey,0
 the room was big and some of the amenities were good ,1
 friendly helpful staff ,1
 the staff is poorly trained which results in slow check in bin bag has not been replaced with baby nappy still in and the room and bed reeked of mould elevator door can t shut properly and card key needs to be swiped at front desk every time before use ,0
 toilet seat on floor hairs in bath and a sink which didn t drain i ordered tea with my breakfast and despite chasing it didn t arrive hopeless ,0
 excellent location and facilities very comfy rooms nice city view ,1
 this is a very very shabby hotel the carpets were threadbare and a definite trip hazard especially in the main lobby reception area and on the stairs there are very small trip steps in the corridors that actually caused me to fall many times the last time i injured my hand and asked to make an entry in the accident book what accident book i was asked that says it all health and safety need to take a close look at this hotel for hazards also the bathrooms were very small if you were over 80kg you would not get in the bathroom ,0
 booked a suite with a tv in bathroom was told none of them worked and was not informed of this previous to booking otherwise would have not hooked with them also location appears nice but one street away it can turn into what looks like a council estate be careful,0
 the room was boiling hot windows did not open had a view of a chimney the staff were ignorant and i think the floor may have been more comfortable than that solid mattress there was mould all around the sink in the bathroom should have gone to the travelodge ,0
 i booked this hotel for the location and i wasn t disappointed it was also lovely inside and i had a good river view ,1
 good location 4 underground lines around the corner great breakfast,1
 i believe that we must have been given the worst room in the hotel it had little natural light with a small window looking onto some sort of central utility area the available lighting in the room was not good enough to read by the carpet had a large thread pulled in the middle of the floor but worst of all and my main complaint the bathroom was dirty and unhygienic with a lump of chewing gum stuck on the floor and large quantities of someone else s hair on the floor in the bath and filling the bath outlet i took photos clearly there was a general lack of care we would never stay there again we did complain at check out and asked to speak to the manager a young man who was apparently in charge was pleasant and apologetic and did not charge us for the two drinks that we had at the bar the night before however in the circumstances i would have expected that he offer an immediate refund when i raised this the young man advised that he was not authorised to do that but that he would pass on my complaint to his superior i have yet to hear back this is the second bad experience that we have had when booking on line ,0
 the bed was amazing actually our whole room large room the park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven ,1
 room cleanliness,0
 location food rate ,1
 cream tea was great room was spacious ,1
 staff were unhelpful at all times ,0
 food was very nice busy in the mornings suggest you rise early to avoid the queue ,1
 reception has little smile or hospitality i feel loud at night even though the room wa on the 5 th floor ,0
 hotel is in need of refurbishment room was very small and bed was uncomfortable ,0
 everything was well looked after good food staff more than helpful,1
 this hotel was full of history and wonderful decor and original fixtures staff were very helpful and made us feel very welcome,1
 the grand royale hotel is blessed with the quality of the staff that it employs ,1
 the size of the bathroom and bedroom not cramped in any way with lovely touches such as bose docking station and samsung flat screen tv,1
 great location for o2 room was fab really luxurious and well equipped staff really helpful and polite ,1
 room was tacky and poor desperate in need of an update certainly not worth anywhere near the price charged ,0
 good quiet location excellent rooms ,1
 the bed ,0
 the busstop at fleetstreet one step away from the hotel furthermore a lot of restaurants and theatres at walking distance the hotel is nice modern clean and quiet ,1
 in a nice area close to the bus and tube station and many shops and coffee shops in the area close to central london the hotel is very big with nice lobby and nice atmosphere ,1
 single rooms are too small and all facing the main street noisy they are not 11mq as stated on the description but something like 5 6 mq just the bed and a small bathroom no wardrobe and no space to open your luggage it could still be fine if the price were half what they request ,0
 the staff was very helpful and the breakfast was very good quality and generous the grande royal is a really special and beautiful old building ,1
 the room was very small it way different with what portrayed in the photos we decided to check out the day after although we still have a booking afterwards and move to other hotel ,0
 everything was perfect staff location cleanliness very impressive i highly recommend it ,1
 clean well presented hotel set in a lovely small square plenty of bars and food places and only 5 minutes from metro and rer stations ,1
 i m absolutely appalled at the fact i booked online with my debit card and the pre authorisation amount was taken which was 156 gbp not a problem but when i arrived on the 29th march i paid on my credit card the same amount 156 the staff said they would reimburse the amount onto my debit card as otherwise i would have paid twice i gave it a week and it didn t go back on i have now phoned 7 have spoke to the duty manager and have even emailed print screens of my online baking personal statements which have all my ingoings and outgoings on to prove i haven t relieved the 156 back onto my debit card it s beyond a joke now i ve been told i ll be contacted many many times and i haven t 156 is a lot of money and i m still 1 month on waiting to receive that amount of money back,0
 the quiet street central location beautiful boutique hotel room friendly staff excellent housekeeping who reacted quickly to requests for extra milk for the coffee very good value price for a hotel in such a location and only 10 minutes walk from paddington and the heathrow express the hotel also helped me to organise a surprise for my new husband in our room which was decorated with petals and roses the service is very personal and was very very much appreciated by us both ,1
 excellent breakfast large room for paris overall really good ,1
 everything was amazing we were very happy and pleased and would definitely go back again also we arrived at 12 34am due to delayed flights all day and the apex staff at the concierge gave us a later check out time ,1
 good air con and lighting controls in room,1
 as soon as you arrived the staff made you feel very welcome the rooms are spacious and comfy great location near a tube station,1
 very friendly staff good sized room good location clean building and room good value for the money being in london and right by tube station,1
 tiny room for 200 while listening to people stamping around above and paper walls next door had enter and leave the room very awkwardly just to get in and out due to no space ridiculous price and nothing like what is shown in the pictures on booking beware ,0
 staff particularly in bar were beyond rude i work in service industry and rarely complain as i know how hard it can be however equally my down time is important and the service and rudeness of staff was just appalling complained bit no one cared stayed here 4 times never again,0
 the bed was awful wonkey which resulted in awful nights sleep not good value for money and won t be back ,0
 perfect location for our needs as we were visiting to attend the 02 arena for a concert we were given an upgrade upon arrival and the two floor to ceiling windows provided an amazing outlook onto the river the breakfast was good enough staff very friendly the car parking charge was far too expensive for my liking but we had no choice ,1
 location is far away from london center no refrigerator available in room toilet facilities are rudimentary one duty manager is not receptive to our needs no arabic channels and bar music is loud consequently difficult to sleep in some night windows at room unsafe it open downward easy to trap children ,0
 staff,0
 lovely building tucked away nice quiet location but not far from theaters restaurants etc door staff welcoming and friendly ,1
 no hot water tepid water had to run around in the shower to keep warm engineer couldn t rectify very small bathroom noisy room poor standard of breakfast expect higher degree of presentation instead of the scrum we experienced have yet to write to the company with my disappointment ,0
 the location is great having an air conditioner in such hot summer is great ,1
 totally overpriced accommodation in poor state and taste not very clean,0
 very friendly and helpful staff and excellent facilities and location restaurant breakfast excellent ,1
 we have stayed here for 6 nights and apparently it was an disappointed stay the guy who helped us with luggages told us soft drinks will be refilled for free daily however we didn t get this service on the second day and it was the same case on the third day i approached to the receptionist and i was told with a face shows i was stupid to ask the drinks including water are only served on the first night which was different from the welcoming words and this arrangement is weird too i m not paying cheaper rates on the 2nd 3rd or 4th night why i don t get the same service as i had the first day the toilet was not working well it keeps flushing and you can t stop it by pushing the bottom as you might concern about the water waste this noise won t allow you to fall asleep when we have finally checked out the staff took me and my uber driver 30 mins to get my stored luggage back if i knew their service was this slow i wouldn t ask them for this service ,0
 great location for the city for the price ,1
 the hotel was well placed for walking to attractions like louvre and notre dame close to metro shops cafes and restaurants nearby were good ,1
 i really enjoyed my stay got a room upgrade on arrival,1
 we were thrilled to find a reasonable rate at a central location and were even more pleased when we were upgraded for free we have a studio with kitchen and living space and hope to return with our son for a london weekend break thank you ,1
 very homely,1
 the position of the hotel and the rooms ,1
 very good location extremely friendly staff old classic building but when we traveled it was in renovations so we could not see much of it quiet and friendly hotel,1
 dirty carpet in bedroom and shower plug blocked water stayed in shower tray ,0
 the room it was loud as it was directly overlooking rue faubourg saint honor i d requested a quiet room it had a large disconnected mobile air conditioning unit taking up quite a lot of space the wifi was patchy in the room ok if you stood at the bedroom door the light coloured carpet was stained in a couple of places it looked dirty the furniture was certainly not of the quality level of a 4 star hotel photos attached at breakfast the coffee cappucino was served in a small coffee pot pre sweetened without froth the fresh fruit salad was pre prepared in little glasses and other fresh fruit needed to be peeled and cut to be eaten messy and not practicable the scrambled eggs were so salty they were inedible at 166 euros for room and board this was no deal it was a decidedly bad deal i d advise giving this hotel a miss ,0
 the overall experience was excellent,1
 we stay at this hotel each time we are in london in a nice quiet street just a short walk to earls court underground station the staff are always friendly rooms are always cleaned properly it s just a nice place to return to after a long day in london great buffet breakfast,1
 the rooms were tiny i nearly feared to stand up straight in the bathroom the roof was so low inexplicably there was no light in the anteroom that housed the only wardrobe for hanging clothes one had to jam the second door to the actual hotel room open in order to see anything the card slot for the access key was particularly hard to find in the dark ,0
 some of the hotel staff are rude i mean some of the male staff more so i counted 5 rats and i believe the hotel management must work to get rid of this rat infestation,0
 50 per room charged as some sort of retainer were not informed of this before we arrived reception staff dreadful need some form of customer service training,0
 our bedroom was very small that together with our very small bathroom and the continual annoyance that the water in the bath was very very very slow exit added to our chagrin i did mention to reception staff the problem we encountered with our bath however nothing transpired to resolve this matter ,0
 beds not comfy tried to charge us 20 night to upgrade to a room with windows when we had a room with windows anyway booked a double room and given a twin room with 2beds pushed together complained changed room to a double rooms very dated and old ,0
 bang olufsen soundbox in the room,1
 room,0
 i booked 3 rooms for 4 nights first night have a bottle of complimentary water only second night no towels in the bath room no refill of suger and milks in the rooms 3rd night no refill of shower shampoo empty bottles in the bathroom very disappointed lift is very small but better than nothing 4th floor rooms are painted in dark red colour small and old very different from the photos shows in booking com website good location but it should not be a 4 star hotel ,0
 right next to tube 2 mins away ,1
 very poor room service the phone did not work no toiletries were included such as toothpaste toothbrush bathroom slippers the refrigerator was not switched on even after speaking to the staff not enough milk provided ,0
 location and staff were excellent arrived early and was aloud to check in with no problems ,1
 great connection to public transport polite service,1

 rooms noise no view for so much money ,0
 everything,1
 bed was comfortable and room is quiet,1
 dirty smelly old facility for a four star hotel and price it doesn t equal what i seen an experienced,0
 they did not give us a much needed late check out in room dining was all microwaveable food and even then we had to return dishes because they were still cold in the middle they gave us a hard time every time we had to ask for something almost everything was unavailable the toiletries were very minimal and scarce for the high bill we paid it was a complete rip off and we do not say that lightly relais christine does not stand up to slh standards ,0
 friendly pro active staff very comfortable bed great location in a quiet street proximity to metro and airport bus,1
 breakfast food the staff the restaurant,1
 room cleanliness wasn t very good bed was uncomfortable toilet roll softness could of been of better quality queuing for breakfast was annoying overpriced for the overall quality of the hotel would not stay there again ,0

 need some upgrading ,0
 the hotel reception and lobby area is beautiful ,1
 excellent location clean ,1
 i wonder who gave the 4 to this upsolutely auwful 2 motel the room was like a cage and was on the lowest floor under the earth that made the walls of the room blowing cold air even if the ac was at 28 c it was freezing also the ac was loud extremely loud and above all the bathroom was with noooooo heating system winter in london 2 to 10 c are you serious its not only decieving but impertinent not even even if sbd payed me i would stay there i accept your apology so what thebasement rooms are still on sale and make sure nobody will get sick in the cellar i pin the view from the window of these 4 motel great view of garbage soooo nice enjoy it and good morning if you think you can make rooms out of your cellar and sell it for a a room in a 4 hotel like that forget it as i asked your personel in the night if they can change my room the answer was a no coz i booked this kind of room a deluxe in a a 4 sure not that was not a room that was where you put your garbage what is booking com do for this what is booking com do for this,0
 it was our honeymoon and we felt that we hotel could of made it special for us but actually found that we were treated like business people ,0
 elevators failed but we were moved right away to lower floor staff was always helpful ,1
 we loved the amazing views from our room as well as the food and the friendliness and efficiency of all of the staff from the doorman to the barman it was my husbands 40th and we had birthday cake left in the room as well as some that was bought to us after dinner which we thought was a lovely touch overall we were very pleased and the found the rates to be good value ,1
 actual pub part of the building is fine but the bedrooms are dire very shabby staircase with stained carpet scuffed battered paintwork gives a really poor impression when going up to the rooms carpets are bad throughout and need changing as a matter of urgency rooms are ok minimalist with shabby cheap furniture grubby looking curtains and ill fitting net curtains at least in the two rooms we saw bed was comfortable but pillows are cheap and need replacing there are also plumbing issues apparently let s hope our experience was a one off generally in need of refurbishment and some money spending on it could be great as the location is fab ,0
 friendly staff cleanliness of room and everywhere else quietness was a welcome surprise given the amount of rooms in the hotel ,1
 everything was outstanding got upgraded asked for extra day and stayed in my upgraded room for price of smaller one awesome staff warm room fantastic breakfast and service want to go back now ,1

 very dated hotel cleanliness of the room was to be desired found the mattress to be quite uncomfortable ,0
 the hotel was under refurbishment but this was not mentioned anywhere at the time of booking as a result there was no steam bath marked clearly in bold as a selling point at time of booking and there was no restaurant there were also no keys available for the hotel rooms this meant every time you left your room and wanted to get back in you had to go to reception and have someone open your room for you i gave the opportunity to the hotel to respond before writing this review and their only comment was had you used the spa you would have been offered 10 discount for the inconvenience and well you were given a free breakfast at 190 per night not good enough ,0
 the location,1
 canary wharf area,0
 excellent place in a great location and great room ,1
 the front office staff was not friendly our room card keep being de magnitized the beds were highly uncomfortable and small for holiday inn standards bathroom was very small very few amenities in the bathroom only soap and shampoo too low for 4 standards ok london is an expensive city but for the rates we were expecting much better service and no free wifi in this day and age unbelievably unacceptable ,0

 housekeeping the first day there were two wash clothes the second day one then none on sunday there was no housekeeping whatsoever never any soap personally i don t like to wash my hands with bubble bath or shampoo security there was no interior lock on the bedroom door much less a deadbolt or even a sliding type reception is situated so that they do not see everyone coming in and going upstairs hospitality i asked to change rooms and was told that i would have to pay an additional 30 pounds a night i had paid in advance at 174 pounds night booking com and hotels tonight were offering rooms at about 130 pounds night 159 for the same dates rooms were available and at lower cost and they wanted me to pay more there was a burn in the curtain and threadbare carpet patches in the tiny room and even smaller bathroom something is amiss here maybe hiring off the books untrained immigrant staff maybe milking the property to pay debts ,0

 the interior was very tired looking my bath leaked the curtain was falling down and the room looked like a 2 star hotel room the staff were not particularly friendly although they agreed to change my room and to include breakfast in the cost of the room the breakfast area was very crowded and the food was average considering what one normally has to pay ,0

 hotel booking wrong took 2hrs to get room sorted booked for breakfast for 3 people kept telling us it was for 2 only every morning ages to sort out no booking record at restaurant had table finally then told to busy in bar to be able to have cocktails made took over an hour to get starter staff unhelpful and offish at times did not enjoy our stay found it very stressful and terrible for a hotel of that caliber ,0
 keep off they charge twice ,0
 when we arrived rather tired after a long haul flight we were told that due to a maintenance issue the deluxe double room booked was not available they offered us a room in a sister hotel which was some distance away by taxi i was not convinced by their explanation and felt they had either double booked my room or simply sold the room on after my booking anyway after much discussion i was allocated a room eventually the room was tiny and cramped with a shower that saturated the entire bathroom floor from my stay i would comment that the hotel is not anything approaching a 4 star i do not understand how it could have achieved such a rating ,0
 undoubtedly a luxurious hotel excellent facilities and a great gin menu the hotel is perfectly located to explore many of the capital s best known landmarks and shopping streets on foot ,1
 i shocked that there was no air condition in the rooms while it shown that it is 4 stars hotel ,0
 perfect place to stay as we were only minutes away from the apollo where we needed to be that evening staff were lovely and breakfast was excellent ,1

 the hotel is under renovation till the end of the works it shouldn t be called hyatt because the standing of the rooms is to poor there for ,0
 room not to preference on arrival had to move rooms the next day no hot water informed the reception every day for 3 days and they only took notice of us on the third day which was the evening before we were due to depart ,0
 the experience,1
 the staff were so welcoming and the little touches in our room like the rose petals and electric candles by our bath made our stay extra special the pillows were a dream to sleep on ,1
 excellent position next to russell square tube station hotel excellent in every way have stayed here several times and dont need to look anywhere else when trravelling to london,1
 the location of this hotel is great it s very close to the tram lines and subway the staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking the breakfast buffet was fine ,1
 the hotel is under renovation and luckily i got a brand new furnished room that i m quite happy with 15 min walk to king s across underground station and 20 min walk to the british museum ,1
 bed and room,1
 dirty bad mantained bad service not friendlu,0
 dusty room and needs ventilation i had trouble breathing from the dust someone was knocking on my door in the morning while i was trying to sleep since i had a very lat night out i couldn t manage to sleep 2 full hours this incident was repeated more than once that morning i complained and asked for an investigation i am waiting for the substitution of the trouble i ve been through from this hotel ,0
 loved the public rooms and the history of the building welcoming staff comfortable room and very good breakfast ,1
 room too small no restaurant bar not business hotel standard,0
 staff excellent room spotless club lounge excellent very relaxing leisure weekend,1
 the hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when i booked it or at any point until we arrived there we then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby the room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which i first discovered with my barefoot we woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete hardly the relaxing break from noisey london that i believed i had booked the pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris the first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead we spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view they will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay this meant on arrival i suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction we made the best of it but i really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and i definitely would have stayed somewhere else ,0
 very helpful staff,1
 very comfortable bed and spacious en suite very enjoyable stay ,1
 location is great close to the underground and over ground stations close to super attractions ,1
 a very run down place,0
 all round perfect stay had a slight problem with air conditioning but quick thinking staff came through with an electric fan was overwhelmed with the fruit basket delivered next morning couldn t ask for more ,1
 very helpful staff excellent views from the room and extremely comfortable beds,1
 we were transferred to another hotel by free taxi given free drinks in the bar whilst we waited for taxi ,1
 the hotel facilities are very old it seems not rennovated since 1970 room is very poor without even a bottle of water or coffee and tea set furniture very old and in a bad condition ,0
 the recognition by the hotel that we were celebrating a special birthday the club room facilities ,1
 i definitely would not recommend staying here we arrived in the morning to leave our suitcases and couldn t check in yet which was fine however there was no secure space available to leave our luggage it was just left next to the reception desk all day when we came back later to check in we were given room g03 on the ground floor it was the worst room i have ever seen the room was right next to the hotel entrance so noise was definitely a problem the room was tiny you could only access the bed from one side and the tv was to the right of the bed so it would have been impossible to watch the window opened on to the side walk of gower street which has a lot of traffic at all times of day so noise was definitely a problem from that side as well there was a horrible smell in the room it smelled like the bathroom hadn t been cleaned in months we went to the reception to ask for a different room because the one we were given was not inhabitable but all they could offer us was some febreeze to mask the smell we ended up having to find another hotel at 8pm in the evening the night before a big work meeting ,0
 basement rooms next to mashine room too noisy even during the night ,0
 room size ventilation and heating staff behaviour specifically when a room was shown to me in the second building across the street which stinked literally like a waste container and there were no apologies later for this massive failure luckily they happened to change my room thanks to availability however they could have charged 122 per night without breakfast in case of no availability ,0
 comfortable bed excellent shower great view,1
 confirmed prior to booking about late check in charges and were reassured that there will be none upon arrival before 00 00 and waiting for a member of staff a gentleman arrived and suggested that we need to pay 90 euros after a bit of discussion the suggestion by him was that we pay 25 euros and leave a good review on the trip adviser website at check out no charges were applied but my experience did not have a good start and their suggestion to ask for a good review in exchange for a charge was not ethical nor friendly ,0
 i think that hotel vendome is one from the best hotels in paris perfect location very good services cozy breakfast definitely i will come back here at my next stop in paris love it ,1
 rude staff dirty rooms no security,0
 efficient stff very helpful comfortable room voucher for harrods bottle of bubbly good deal ,1
 asked for early check in as we were going to twickenham to watch the rugby and wanted to get changed they said no asked for a first floor room given a ground floor room room was dark and dingy bed was ok and sheets were nice and clean bathroom was incredible basic cold water tap didn t work at all on the bath so scalded ourselves in the boiling water loo didn t always flush first time wouldn t return,0
 the main issue for me was cleanliness and this led to me complaining in the end however in addition there was no hot water on my first night or the next morning so it was not possible to shower no information was provided either i had to ask reception who said there had been a problem with the boiler no apology or compensation etc the fridge was not working was dirty and when i investigated the plug found the socket hanging from the wall the window couldn t be opened which made the room claustrophobic despite the air con however the final straw was on the last night when i got in bed i noticed there seemed to be a plastic based sheet under the main bedsheet it didn t seem to fit properly and so i investigated and found an under sheet made of plastic towelling top this was badly stained had hair on it and was filthy i took this off and remade the bed at the same time 10 45 pm a fire alarm also went off it did stop after a minute or so but i was concerned and rang reception however the line was dead and i had to ring from my mobile to get through everything was fine but this was another thing not working also one of the bedside lights i told the receptionist re sheet the next morning and asked a manager to go and look at it before the room was made up i asked that i have a response from the manager when i picked my case up however there was no message for me and as there was a different receptionist i decided to email my complaint so far i have had no reply so pretty poor and i would not recommend this hotel which charged me 96 per night i did not eat there so can t comment on food etc ,0
 bed was comfortbale the room clean and tidy with enough space for our things the bathroom has a contemporary look with modern features and even loo roll with valentines hearts air con worked well and fresh fruit and water was provided before we arrived breakfast was fantastic choices from english breakfast salmon salad vegetables fruit pastry and so on the quality was realmy good the room we had breakfast in was well decorated and added to our experience staff was also friendly and help me find a replacement room because i wasn t happy with the first ,1
 great location and lovely room ,1
 walking distance to many good restaurants hyde park 3 minute walk to underground rooms were very very clean both times i stayed felt pretty safe walking alone at night in this area felt that premises room were secure and it s pretty ,1
 our entire stay was so relaxing and we will definitely be stay there again ,1
 bed was the hardest bed i have ever tried to sleep in room had stains on the walls had my do not disturb sign on the door and housekeeping kept knocking on the door to see if they could come in i had been working nights so wanted to sleep during the day not have them knock on the door throughout the day ,0
 comfy duvet spacious studio ideal for up to 4 adults great view of the london eye and a special message on the window written for my birthday wishes and a bottle of wine balloons front reception staff were very welcoming and professional ,1
 wifi was a desaster old and noisy small rooms,0
 friendly staff,1
 the staff were rude and unhelpful the room was tiny and boiling dirty couldn t wait to leave,0
 the rooms could of been much bigger the tv was in an awkward place and wasn t enough room to even swing a cat also took payment without my knowledge,0
 very poor price quality balance room was outdated connecting doors caused significant noise staff did not respond at all to complaints will not use this hotel again,0
 no complimentary water,0
 dirty sheets broken pillow noisy airconditioning which you have to keep it running all night to keep warm temperature quite high prices for such a remote location from the city ,0
 they have a hold on my card which they won t release,0
 excellent location nice and quiet with easy access to the earl s court tube station ,1
 nothing really a little noisy due to the traffic around the station but once the doors were closed the noise subsided ,0
 room decor was very tatty the hotel needs serious renovation for the money being charged ,0
 we were in room 442 and the bed was very squeaky apart from that was lovely,1
 the rooms where dirty dated and beds worn uncomfortable no bath robes for both days dispenser fridge out of date diet coke given false information to park car at tescos,0
 the room was great i couldn t ask for a better night sleep ,1
 we were informed it would be a king sized bed not 2 beds pushed together not exactly comfortable they couldn t even be bothered to clean the room when we moved in there were another ladies fake nails lying in the bathroom and all over the rooms floor underneath the bed certainly hadn t seen a hoover in as many weeks it was disgusting inside the wardrobe al though the disgusting habit of another probably previous guest had left chewing gum stuck inside the wardrobe all above was raised in a polite manner with reception they informed us they would have the room cleaned immediately when we returned they had presented a nice fruit platter a bottle of wine and an apology note which was a really nice thing to do but they had actually forgotten to clean the room it would have been nice to use the complimentary coffee and machine they provide for guest who pay the extra for the prestige room but as above not only do they forget to clean your room they forget about the coffee station also so not only unkept but un replenished the breakfast hours are fantastic 07 00 till 11 00 we thought this would be great unfortunately the breakfast area is only big enough to accommodate maybe 10 rooms at 1 time so best try and get there early as you may not be able to sit for breakfast or they may not be anything left after day 2 we decided to eat out for breakfast it was just a disgrace ,0
 very clean and tidy modern room bed was comfortable staff were friendly great location under 10 minute walk to paddington station first time to london and would return to this hotel ,1
 comfortable beds,1
 size of the room location and view,0
 beds were comfy upgraded to a studio which was nice,1
 on arrival the chinese lady at the desk was very rude and unhelpful the room was dirty and the window sills was full of cobwebs and dead spiders flies our room was on 12th floor and every 3 minutes could hear the tube train which sounded like thunder windows was dirty and didn t open which didn t help with the aircon making a loud noise which is why i think they put in a small desk fan food in the indian restaurant was sent back and as for the breakfast well i would have taken mcd breakfast any day ,0
 the room had not been dusted properly the hair drier was in a very dangerous condition it nearly caught fire the furniture was tatty the twin beds were very small and uncomfortable a bad 2 night stay not value for money ,0
 the room was very small and basic also when asked about promotions the staff had little or no clue what i was talking about when we asked for a knife to chop up fruit in our room the kitchen staff point blank refused in hindsight i wish i had gone and booked a premier inn ,0
 rag tag room poor shower and wash facilities had to call on engineers to fix things air con poor for the price you pay far better hotels for the price around ,0
 a nice hotel in a very convenient location very clean people at reception and generally everyone i interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference i also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries all this made up for the price which i initally thought a bit too much and i still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room if i paid the full amount i would think it is overpriced but i guess that s london in the summer ,1
 tube pretty much around the corner friendly staff and the breakfast was really good also all the royal parks in easy walking distance ,1
 the staff was so friendly and more than happy to help with any questions there was always a cleaner in the spa area and on the room floors ,1

 no aircon rude bar staff,0
 we were given a single occupancy room in error but the hotel was sold out so had no choice but to stay there the room was tiny the bed was tiny and it had the quality of furniture you would expect in a hostel not a 4 hotel took 35 minutes just to check in restaurant lost our reservation ,0

 i was discriminated against and treated shabbily by the receptionist even after i upgraded to a suite with a balcony for smoking even after i specified i wanted a smoking room i payed extra 80 to upgrade and an extra 210 for the second night one of the receptionists was very hostile and driscriminative towards me he called the police to harass me and evict me from my suite i payed a total of 443 for and wrongly accused me of being a drug dealer because every black man who can afford the finer things in life is a drug dealer this is core racism ,0

 the rooms are not as the photos look old dated furniture musty smell,0
 staff were not helpful,0
 unclean overpriced hotel dirty rooms dirty windows burned carpets unclean towels room with a view view of the construction site all in all horrible experience,0
 comfort of the bed,1
 the location is excellent there loads of cafe restaurants groceries waitrose sainsbury tesco around georguoes kensington hyde park is just across the road bus stops and underground all just a step away so all and all good value for money friendly staff ,1

 room small and furnture old,0
 concierge was abrupt and less than helpful we woulnt have asked him if we knew the answer one however was ok ,0

 very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood never even try to book there there were people using drugs just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us the staff was not helpful and grumpy on top of this the tv was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of paris right next to the dumping ground a big no if you want to stay safe ,0
 front desk staff were excellent ,1
 there was a dripping tap in the sink the shower basin filled up and did not drain easily some of the switches and electricity plugs were not secure ,0
 the hotel is well located and the rooms are spacious and very comfortable what makes this hotel stand out from the rest is the staff they are so helpful and very attentive i cannot speak highly enough of the staff they help to make it a great hotel in london ,1
 unhelpful staff no atmosphere in restaurants not good quality food overpriced food heating air conditioning issues run down ,0
 i did the reservation for my family and mentioned the name of the person who will stay and pay they refused to let my family enter the room untill i send them an email to confirm the names again the suite is not suitable for a family with child ad they say in the booking the location of the hotel is so far from the center ,0
 hotel very noisy due to air conditioning service ducts staff poor on customer care rooms tired and not the most comfortable ,0
 the bed was extra comfy cosy the staff were really helpful friendly the breakfast was delicious nice welcoming bottle of wine bowl of fruit ,1
 very nice staff comfortable bed ,1
 the staff and room were excellent,1
 i had to ask to change rooms on 3 occasions due to construction and poor cleanliness of room one smelled of raw sewage and staff thought it was acceptable to spray items on the floor and leave me a spray to keep the smell low the construction work was horrendous and couldn t sleep in morning after long nights of business meetings rooms didn t look like web page and when asked staff if they had one like the web page they laughed in my face also tried to put an unexpected 3 70 on my bill for something never used will not recommend until some sort of apology or rebate is discussed in person regards mr h goudie 07828064307,0
 best breakfast i have ever encountered the selection and quality was so impressive and i ve stayed in some of the best hotels in the world staff on reception were exceptional nothing was too much trouble and they even printed off some tickets for me perfect location for the o2 to see the atp world tennis finals,1
 no real welcome or warmth from the staff who all seemed harrassed and overworked discovering a dirty quilt cover at bedtime was unforgiveable had to wait for housekeeping to come and change it the bar service was very poor after being ignored for almost 15 minutes had to ask to be served breakfast service was worse even in executive dining they use some kind of wipe clean cloth almost like plastic which was so wet when we sat down that we had to use the paper napkins to dry it the breakfast service was extremly slow and the quality was not good dried up bacon undercooked egg cold beans and tea that was so weak it struggled to crawl out of the pot unaided not worth the money ,0
 cocktails in the lobby bar it has a fantastic buzz try the charlie ,1
 the bed wasn t comfy the location was very bad we went out the front door and people were urinating in the street the staff added things to our bill although we didn t have them i wouldn t reckonmend this place to anyone also the hotel was to far away from the main attractions had to get a taxi everywhere ,0
 room service atrocious wrong numbers on menu no answer on phone going through to ee voicemail when breakfast came only part of it bed very uncomfortable soundproofing non existent,0
 room was of high quality and bed was very comfortable location was good for visiting the tourist sites of inner london ,1
 mr taleb the receptionest the way he talk about the very small room we have even i offer to bay for bigger room but he refused saying next time it s better to book through our site on the net luckily the booking was for one night the second day i moved to better 4 star hotel with larger room breakfast included and even city tax included but mr taleb ask for it even booking reservation said tax include ,0
 i wanted an interconnected rooms for me and my family but the only ones offered were on the back side of the hotel with nothing to see through the windows also the rooms were ate the attic where half of the rooms occupied by the structure so we lost space the room service communication is poor and they don t respond before keep calling for 15 min and calling the reception to let them respond we couldn t make any booking for christmas eve dinner although we stay at the hotel no privilege we had 2 rooms but they rejected our request to keep only one room for late check out at 1 pm we had to exit at 12 sharp ,0
 location great and staff friendly and helpful ,1
 rooms are clean with modern bathrooms and the all important good shower the bar and lounge areas were really nice and had lots of character and felt comfortable actually making use of them as a solo traveller would return ,1
 rooms are tiny cannot move in them no help offered with luggage scaffolding all up the front not worthy of 4 stars ,0
 place is worn and beds old and uncomfortable cleanliness of bathrooms is not good paid 164 for an exec double expecting a decent standard would have been better in travelodge or premier inn breakfast was cheap produce and badly organised,0
 upgrade to penthouse as problem with booking on arrical,1

 the room s dirty and sth stinks the staff are unpleasant ,0
 nothing,1
 1 the design of toilet and shower room is terribly unacceptable in standard room we add 100 pounds upgraded to a studio suite because of these reasons in my own opinion the studio suite just like a standard room of normal hotels it doesn t worth such price and can t be named suite 2 cleaning staff knocked our room everyday at 9 00 it woke us up everyday it s really annoying 3 write off the bill automatically through my credit card without getting my permit ,0
 friendly staff,1

 room around 50 feet from neighbour building going through huge renovation starting at 3 30 4 pm in the morning with big pipes being noisily placed elsewhere managers shouting out orders workers talking loudly with each other woke up impossible to go back to sleep important meetings all day long ahead advised hotel manager in charged who offered breakfast as compensation answered they should never have given a room next to such a mess in the first place of course they knew about the noise if such a mistake is made you just don t charge hugely upset and of course with absolutely no time for breakfast or any effort whatsoever to remain a second more in that place than it took to get out of there jennifer,0
 room very quiet and bed extremely comfortable great location for o2 would definitely go back ,1
 great location friendly staff clean modern room good breakfast as well ,1
 our executive king room was a cramped cave without windows we moved rooms to something a bit larger but which overlooked an alley frequented by drugs transactions and multitudes of rats multitudes we could see the open doorway to the hotel kitchen in this rat infested alley needless to say room service was no longer an option to cap off our stay the king bed was two rock hard singles pushed together if that didn t keep us awake there was a near constant scratching and squeeking behind the walls and in the ceilings ,0
 decor service fresh herb garden ,1
 very well located very good breakfast service very good staff,1
 the room was dark and small and felt claustrophobic tv did not work and accessing it was like walking through a maze given the rate night not good value for money ,0

 staff were welcoming and helpful and the ease of check in was great after a long flight is was nice to be welcomed by a smile and a no fuss attitude the food and wine selection offered was what you would expect of sofitel a very high standard thank you scribe for a wonderful stay,1

 appalling room service incorrect food delivered being woke at 8 30 by drilling and hammering 40 minutes wait to check in sky bar closed interested staff at checkout,0
 english breakfast was great ,1
 the staff were extremely friendly yet proper i felt like royalty being there i especially enjoyed the location near a lot of different things ,1
 i booked the room about 3 weeks ahead just festival hours before we arrive i received a call from the hotel that they needed to switch me to another sister hotel about 10 minutes from the hotel due to maintenance i checked and found that the hotel we have been asked to move to is about 70 less than what we paid that s after deducting the cost of breakfast offered to us as a convenience ,0
 our room was in the basement with very little light the room was not pleasing to spend time in the shower base was broken ,0
 good location,1
 property is currently under refurbishment which makes the current facilities very poor and the rooms fairly run down certainly not the 4 star rating very old carpet 1 lift to serve both clients and servicing unfortunately this was not clearly stated when booking the room online ,0
 we stayed here for 3 nights 17 18 19 dec to celebrate my wife s birthday we chose this hotel as we had stayed here before for the exact same dates two years ago and had a very enjoyable time this time was very different our booking from booking com shows we had booked a superior room but this is not what we were given the room was so small that the double bed had to be sited against the wall which meant that i had to climb over my wife for the usual nocturnal visit to the bathroom also i couldn t have a glass of water at the bedside and obviously the was no reading light my side not ideal for a couple in their sixties we were informed that the hotel was full so no other rooms were available we were here however to enjoy ourselves and decided to get on with it but this is not what you expect from a 4 star hotel when we checked out i asked how many such rooms the hotel had and was informed by the check out lady that they had only a few and these were normally reserved for single occupancy but when the hotel is full they were given to couples i then asked why we were chosen for such a room as we had booked and paid for a superior room on october at this point she became very coy and stated that someone had to have it i again i asked why us but she just repeated someone had to have it i got the impression that because we had booked via booking com and had probably paid less that some other guests we were fobbed off with a room that you could not call standard never mind superior i ask for some kind of recompense from booking com as the room was not what was described i have been a good customer and booked many stays with them and this experience leaves a bad taste jess ashman,0
 no wifi in rooms maids knocking the door at 8 45 am,0
 the property was extremely dated the bedroom was horrendous curtains broken carpet dirty and bathroom wasn t cleaned the furniture was broken and dated we tried to check in 1 30 but room not available we went back at 7 to be told they didn t have a double room and would upgrade us but because i refused to pay the extra 50 deposit making it 100 00 they seemed to find me this horrid room i d asked for a room with a view as my 11 year son had never visited london before omg it was of back buildings so so disappointed i cannot tell you please read all reviews though i had and thought i m sure itl be ok but how wrong was i i truely recommend not going there ,0
 ac not really working in the room fan very noisy and difficult to sleep room not smelling good room service inexisting i called 4 times at 23 00 and no one answer need to go to reception to order drink and just one guy in room servoce for 400 rooms twenty minutes to wait at the bar to se one waiter bringing menu then 30 minutes for two glasses of wine then i had to go myself to the bar to get ice cubes because waiter forgot and after all 10 minutes to wait for paying and no way to charge the room tv system very slow and poor quality only two coffee capsule why not just one ,0
 we loved the view from our window of big ben and the london eye the two boys aged 10 and 12 loved the park plaza euros to spend at the bar i thought this was a brilliant idea ,1
 room was very queit,1
 access to accommodation awful awful apartment awful access in main hotel no responsibility accepted for any problems we overpaid for the accommodation we got they would not return left toilet bag full of expensive items without being able to use my credit card up to 50 booking com also not helpful at all would not recommend either to any one even though we have used booking com quite a lot ,0
 they upgraded me free of charge to a better room as it was our first anniversary also provided us free chocolate as a present little touches ,1
 good proximity to hyde park staff made sure my requests of soy milk for breakfast and a room with windows that open were met things i like white sheets comfy pillows great shower lovely window view not too hot in rooms dental pack big breakfast choice esp fresh fruit and friendly staff ,1
 one of the things which i didnt like it is that i have to pay 20 dollors if i want to buy a food from outside the hotel and eat it in my room,0
 the experience was very bad staff unprofessional especially the reception bad bad bad room service this hotel dont deserve to be 4 stars at all max 2 5 stars ,0

 room was adequate for one night stay clean and quiet breakfast nice eggs cooked to order ,1
 friendly staff and overall experience,1
 first of all we were asked to pay for our rooms when we checked in which for me is always an alarming sign as you can t see the room and check that everything is as described on the website before paying as it tuned out the pictures were much better than the reality then we were told when checking in that the heater was not switched on in the rooms 28th of december and that if we wanted the room warmer we would need to call reception as they controlled the heating system from there of course the rooms were freezing cold and it turned out that the heating system was not working in 2 out of 3 of the rooms that we had rented and the maintenance person had to work on the system in these 2 rooms to make it work while our room was ok yet extremely small my friends room were absolutely minuscule i have booked hotels many times in london and the double rooms they were given were the size of single rooms in other hotels the beds would have been fine for 1 person but definitely not for 2 people as the mattresses were probably of the lowest quality possible or old and had a curve in the centre making it impossible not to sleep on top of another the bathrooms were clean and were probably the only part of the experience close to deserving the 4 stars rating all the little details were there to tick the boxes and make sure that this hotel gets rated 4 stars samples of soap and shampoo hair dryer elevator etc however these details were of the lowest quality possible finally two of my friends could not sleep because of a noise which they thought was the tube and turned out to be a big pipe sending steam and vapours against their window when they mentioned it at reception they were told that they should have asked for ear plugs to conclude this place feels like a totally unloved hotel a place that would need a big refurbishment and some care to allow it a pleasant customers experience ,0
 easy to find and a good area for kensington exploring,1
 clean and comfortable,1
 hotel was old not well maintained bathroom was just disguising housekeeper couldn t speak english,0
 special thanks to restaurant staff eric and rachid for all their help and kindness,1

 everything was fine no problems at all ,1
 staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm good location to walk around london ,1
 the room was nice and clean with good facilities we were up on the 8th floor so no noise from any traffic heard bed was nice and comfortable and the bathroom was spotless ,1
 the staff were very friendly and as we were celebrating our silver wedding anniversary the hotel made us feel very special the location was also very good as it was 2 minutes walk from a tube station and to the park ,1
 lay out of the room was dreadful,0
 i booked three rooms for my guest with my credit card i gave all informations two days before arrival by mails and callings directly but they didnt get the payment from my credit card they charged all the payment from my guests even all my warnings it was so shameful i do hundreds booking all over the world in a year i never face before like this ,0
 staff were fantastic,1
 location character of hotel friendly staff good beer in the bar friendly bar staff ,1
 breakfast,1
 the scrambled egg at breakfast was fantastic ,1
 the asian staff in reception in the morning is quite nice but the one who is in charge of the reception in the night is bad both in facial expression and attitude we only have a luggage but the moment he saw the luggage he gave us a obvious white eye and started to murmured about his backache we even not asked for any help if this is the attitude goes with a so call 4star hotel i think the full score must be ten star ,0
 this hotel has a beautiful atmospheric lobby the staff are friendly and accommodating and it is positioned by two tube stations and near hyde park,1
 20 minutes for 2 cocktails at an empty bar because staff were rude the heating in the room didn t work and they couldn t move us walked in on twice while we were sleeping at 9 30 am and then again at 12 30pm why 9 30am even with a do not disturb sign on door disgusted as staff didn t apologise ,0
 sadly for the price it costs its just not worth the money the deluxe room is tiny and this was an upgrade dread to think what we would have got if we hadn t not clean enough and looking tired which you wouldn t expect from somewhere of this price range and star ,0
 lovely place to stay breakfast was excellent ,1
 booking com misrepresented what i was booking and have ignored my emails since this was a ruined birthday trip and despite being a loyal customer for years i do not intend to book through them again,0
 we go upgrade for guests of day,1
 small very shabby worn out ,0
 i have been several times in london this is my best hotel stay close to everything ,1
 comfy bed,1
 everything was great the service the rooms location ,1
 this was our second time staying at this hotel and we love it it s so central with a great family room set up and the view of the eye always makes me happy this time there was a mistake on a room service food order but it was quickly remedied and the charge removed ,1
 not fare if we accepted staying in this hotel during the noise of renovation work at least they have to upgrade customers room or give them tower view or at least putting a bottle of complimentary water didn t like how do they manage the renovation period it reflects the new owners management mentality for this i will never step a foot in again ,0
 great service from the staff all of them very friendly extra mention to diana in reception very friendly and helpful ideal location for visiting the o2 arena,1
 good location very friendly staff and a decent bar and restaurant area room was well equipped,1
 we booked superior suite and they gave the room in basement 1 floor beds are old and worn out even bedheads are fractured long story short the hotel needs reconditioning ,0
 very poor value for money very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out very disappointed and first time i ve had a poor hotel from booking com,0
 extremely slow check in staff pleasant but incompetent allocation of unsuitable room last available apparently but not sufficiently pre advised to book elsewhere incredibly noisy due to lack of adequate glazing on 3rd floor leading to sleepless night ,0
 no ample space in room no refrigerator available in room no continental breakfast and no varieties in dishes far away from center the surrounding is loudly hotel rate is high i paid high accommodation price electrical receptacles difficult to connect your own devices requires extensions furniture are old and must be changed housekeeping provides lip services and face lifting is mandatory to upgrade hotel facilities ,0
 the hotel was in a nice location it was clean and the staff were very frendly,1
 everything,0
 overall a pleasant stay and location ,1
 see above,0
 staff were rude messed our rooms up,0
 the executive lounge the rooms and the whole hotel,1
 the location and the relaxed atmosphere ,1
 we had to change room twice the first room we went to it had fungus i m the room the walls were extremely dirty and you couldn t breath then asked to be moved and got chargerd and that room the air con was not working and it was so hot outside we couldn t breath and my partner is ill we then got moved to a 3rd room and had to pay the 79 difference because they had no other rooms and when i asked the staff to open a window she refused and was so rude to me and my partner the worst experience ever and no one even said sorry when it was no fault of our own ,0
 very cosy,1
 the staff was bad for the customers and cleaning service so bad ,0
 no aircon in the room suite requested maintenance but none turned up given a large fan for the room which was so noisy you couldn t sleep ,0

 excellent location lovely room friendly helpful staff ,1
 location friendliness of staff beds very comfortable breakfast good next to the tube station which was brillianthotel is beautiful inside and has a commanding appearance,1
 just about everything the airco was noisy and ineffective my sleep was disturbed by clonking pipes the shower water when tuned to full heat was not even lukewarm the staff refused to give me a invoice since i wasn t the person who paid for the room and called me rude when i insisted ,0
 large comfy bed welcoming staff,1
 room air conditioner was making huge noise and if you don t turn on you want have air in the room they open a window for as around 7cm when i book hotel i ask for two bads and they were in my booking but when we come into room they were two bads but together you can not walk around them i work in hospitality business also and i didn t like attitude of the waiters for breakfast plus they were piking up dishes holding the glasses for the rim and than with the same fingers making new set up unacceptable for a 4 star hotel for taverna it is ok last night we ask for a bottle of proseko they didn t have than we ask for a bottle of vouve champagne they also didn t have eventually we got a bottle of rose cahmpagne ,0
 had very noisy people next door to a room and woke my son up not impressed with that and the staff are very slow to are problem,0
 amazing staff good food facility wifi near the underground restaurants are nearby,1
 price,0
 this hotel is something very special the staff treated us like vips which we re not from the moment we walked up to the entrance to the moment we left the room was beautiful with the biggest most comfortable bed i think i ve ever slept in the walkway wasn t open to the o2 yet but the hotel laid on a shuttle service however to save us waiting the very nice concierge called claudio drove us there personally in a bmw after the concert we had a drink in the bar on the 18th floor overlooking the river and the lights at night a magical end to a magical stay thank you to what i think is one of the best hotels in london ,1
 see above,0
 we had a first room and it was terrible it had bird poo on the window ledge it was dark gloomy and cold it felt depressing i also had to pay to upgrade for the room which i don t understand ,0
 the first time i my life i arrived to the hotel and was told that the hotel did not have room i booked i could not believe it no warnings email of phone call simply we are full we have no room for you the room i booked and paid for ,0
 i liked the location was so close to the station room was clean bathroom was clean,1
 i absolutely loved the original features within the hotel the corn icing the wood panelling the oringal windows absolutely wonderful the bar on the second floor where lillie langtree aparently entertained guest is quirky and charming comfortable beds just around the corner from a tube station and opposite hyde park ,1
 everything room is spacious very comfortable,1
 room is very very small not even room to walk around room is in bad shape you can not pay with maestro i did need to go to the bank to get cash money much better hotels in paris than this one ,0
 room wasn t ready rooms freezing hotel basic and outdated,0
 close to the tube excellent bed breakfast hours are great until noon on weekends ,1
 booking error caused our booking to be for a single room which they could not let my wife and i stay in they were unwilling to accommodate us and charged us full price despite filling the room after the fact ,0
 the bed wasn t that comfy the noise level in the basement from above was awful staff weren t helpful quite rude ,0
 location is excellent and the rooms were a decent size lots of privacy for anyone sleeping on the sofa bed in the lounge area our flight arrived very early and the rooms were not ready we didn t expect them to be but staff organised access to the gym for an early shower which was great ,1
 the neighborhood was unsafe too small room poor breakfast,0
 worn out hotel under renovation partly huge not user friendly too expensive for what they offer,0
 all the rest except location avoid ,0
 we did not have breakfast as it was too expensive,1
 selection was fantastic and quality of the food was very good indeed ,1
 our room was very uniquely arranged with an impressive double headed shower and massive windows very memorable the hotel is right next to a large nice park staff was friendly ,1
 very nice comfortable room,1
 tv did not work until the last night of my stay room was not clean dust everywhere have stayed here many times before but this time the service and facilities not worthy of five star prices will stay elsewhere next time ,0
 1 rats rats squeaking all night from somewhere around the room 2 wash basins were clogged had to change room because the hotel owner decided to paint next door room at 8 00 pm we couldn t stand the paint smell 3 double bed was so big that only one person can sleep easily 4 every time had to login to their hotel registration site to gain wifi access and that too deliberately of very slow speed so that customers can upgrade to faster speed even my 3g speed was faster than hotel wifi 5 if anyone travelling by car please avoid this place location as the parking charges near hotel are 37 per day 6 rating from me 0 zero star ,0
 rooms were filthy dusty and hair in the bath,0
 room not as described on hotel website poor service from staff plastic rubber sheets over mattress made the bed uncomfortable house keeping staff knocking on the door early in the morning on a bank holiday ,0
 rooms are tatty and need refurbishment also found the reception staff a chinese girl to be quite rude not even saying hello when a got to desk had to change room as next to lift but had to pay for the upgrade i believe this isn t good enough will not be staying here again,0
 no wifi the first day and staff could not help to make it better location was actually further than expected from the arch of triumph,0
 we had to wait an hour for our room was not ready though we turned up half an hour after the check in time though the guest relations officer offered us free breakfast for our stay in lieu the room allotted was dingy and musty my son who is allergic to dust started coughing immediately overall the staff had smiles on their faces but didn t seem particularly interested in us or maybe they were too busy looking after other guests i would not rate this place value for money i would rate it one star for the convenient location ,0
 just in a perfect location frendly staff and staff very helpful,1
 the room was neat and very clean and the location is amazing ,1
 staff went over and above to make our stay unforgettable for our anniversary,1
 everything about it got given keys to someones room walked in and they were in there haha,0
 excellent hotel in every aspect fantastic location with only a 2 3 minute walk to the tube station which takes you into central london rooms are small but perfectly formed with a lovely bathroom all the staff are very polite and friendly and sorted out the small problem with the bathroom sink and brought a firmer pillow with no issues great choice of buffet breakfast both hot and cold all replenished regularly would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone ,1
 the location is the worst location in the whole of london no tube close by catching a ferry is a serious inconvenience trying to get a taxi all the was an inconvenience staff were extremely unfriendly and english is very poor a terrible hotel and completely overpriced my whole experience of london was terrible due to this hotel ,0
 loved everything about this hotel they was very friendly and made us feel welcome,1
 got exactly what i expected for the price food and drink were expensive but you expect this from this type of hotel ,1
 everything other than breakfast,0
 the breakfast is thumbs up with its variety n quality ,1
 the stay was fantastic absolutely no issues whatsoever helpful and friendly staff lovely clean rooms absolutely no complaints whatsoever the best possible place to stay for an event at the o2 would definitely book again ,1
 i had booked initially a single room and never seen in my whole life a 4 star hotel offering a rudimentary single bed with the room just the size of the bed that s scandalous never thought that room that size existed in any hotel even motels are much more spacious i had to pay 20 extra per night in order to upgrade with a queen bed that s just even more scandalous decor is dramatically old style old fashion not at all the image of brand new canary wharf while i travel a lot i had never seen a hotel where you would pay extra for a late check out that is just by 1 hour check out time was 11am and had to negotiate hard to allow me until 12pm as i had an important meeting in the morning before i could check out so disappointing no 4 star stance for sure and no value for money at all definitely overpriced for the basic comfort and bad service expensive hotel rooms which are clearly overvalued and not worth the money ,0
 i left early in the morning 630 and they didnt arrange a croissant or anything as the kictchen opens at 7 even iof people was ther for the check out ,0
 the room,0
 brilliant hotel perfect location,1
 cables of open lifts causes steady noise clack clack that disturbs at night in some room after a roomchange it was okay ,1

 alex the staff on reception were so polite helpful would most certainly recommend this hotel to my family friends for sure ,1
 staff,0
 air conditioning seemed not to work was like sleeping in a sauna especially as it was one of the hottest days of the year rooms were not cleaned properly and were grimey from use repeatedly banged my knee on the corner of the bed where the room was not big enough and too tightly fitted blocking access to toilet upon checkout i found other people complaining about the ridiculous heat and lack of cleanliness all round poor staff generally seemed disinterested in customer satisfaction and did not want to be there expected more from a best western ,0
 service from staff was superb all round ,1
 breakfast and friendliness of reception staff,1
 the size of the room 10sq meters the condition of the room cracked floor tiles handles that came off in your hand the unprofessional attitude of some of the staff i am their customer not their college friend,0
 wifi doesn t work on the 4th floor floor in the bedroom was unbelievably squeaky everywhere no hot water after midnight terrible soundproofing between room and corridor old knackered and slow lift depressing room decor ,0
 this hotel is slipping in quality the beds need to be upgraded our mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable the night staff the day i arrived were surly and unhelpful a little manners training is in order ,0
 hole place needs to be cleaned and painted we couldt buy any coffee in the evening as the bar staff said they where to busy to make it for us also tea bags in the room are not of good quality for the money i paid i expected alot more of my overall stay ,0
 highly recommend this hotel after many hours of searching for the perfect one for a young couple,1
 lage ambiente personal,1
 location and price for family room was main attraction ,1
 room extremely small not a single chair or small table to put your belongings simply there was no space i asked for another room and was told all were the same size wifi did not work had to come down to the lounge to have internet,0

 staff are amazing location is good rooms are a good size for paris,1
 we upgraded our room as we arrived early and it was only a small extra charge the room was amazing with a great view staff were really helpful and the location is amazing it s only a 5 minute stroll to the london eye so you re right in the middle on everything couldn t have asked for more ,1
 service is sucks its not safe my friend bag got stolen inside the room its really scary and the hotel management not really good in dealing with this situation they are also very rude and they don t have a restaurant inside the room there are no refrigerator while they claim they have ,0
 everything,0
 my husband and i were very disappointed with our 2 night stay at the doubletree by hilton london kensington we came to the uk from abu dhabi for 5 days the main purpose of the trip being for me to have an operation we booked the hotel expecting to have a relaxing and comfortable last 2 nights in london post operation we booked a queen guest room and couldn t believe what we saw when we arrived to our room a tiny dark and pokey room with no space outside of the bed and about 2 inches from the window was a concrete wall it felt like a prison not the kind of room you would find in a doubletree by hilton hotel and totally overpriced for 165 pounds per night we complained and as an act of goodwill one of the managers moved us to a suite for the same price he showed us the room and as we were rushing to go and grab some dinner neither one of us asked why it was so hot assuming the air conditioning was just switched off in actual fact the air conditioning was broken we had just one fan and this was during one of the hottest spells in the year so what appeared to be a goodwill gesture was indeed nothing more than a disingenuous token to shut us up as the manager would have known the air conditioning was broken when he offered us the complimentary upgrade when we returned from dinner and moved rooms we came into a hot and stuffy room which although better than the first room was very uncomfortable we had planned to stay in the hotel room the following day so i could relax post operation however this was not possible due to the lack of air conditioning we were given an extra 2 fans which did not make much difference so spent 2 sleepless nights in the hotel during our stay we noticed other guests complaining about the lack of air conditioning and issues connected to it like leaks in their rooms the staff were not overly concerned about the complaints ,0
 very poor service wifi almost none exists breakfast not attractive at all ,0
 location,1
 room was fabulous,1
 i appreciate warm professional staff willing to assist the customers great hotel very well placed near british museum nice ambiance comfortable rooms and clean ,1
 location near to olympia hotel bright and airy ,1
 staff were extremely polite and happy to help in any capacity although it was a single room it did not feel cramped or as though i was less important than anyone else lovely bathroom ,1
 i liked the fact that the hotel was a lovely old building with a grand reception area and decor the staff were friendly and the rooms spacious and clean the hotel was within walking distance from the british museum covent garden soho i also liked the fact that it is practically next to russell square underground station and holborn statio is very close ,1
 we had a room facing the park which was a great deal for paris the breakfast was excellent ,1
 sevice and facilities,1
 smell poor cleanliness faded room rubbish breakfst,0
 really close to everything and it was warm and comfortable,1
 spa shower tray extra small impossible for an adult to shower without getting bruises breakfast very cheap,0

 they did not clean the room when i complained at the check out they suggested to do this over the web and did not apologize ,0
 great location close to tube and walking distance to shops,1
 poor facilities bathroom was disgusting had to be asked to moved to a different room which wasn t much better won t be coming again ,0
 the location is unbeatable both from the point of view of access to all the sites and attractions of central london but also the area where the hotel is located is very attractive the hotel is quite the staff were very friendly facilities in the bedroom and bathroom were first class ,1
 staff not adequate to standards,0
 everything was amazing and the women who served me was great and very helpful ,1
 absolutely superb location on the doorstep of kensington gardens and close to notting hill ,1
 the rooms are incredibly small very different from what one sees in the photos on the website there was also a noisy boiler in my room which went on and off the whole night and i could barely sleep ,0
 amazing suite with fantastic views really friendly and accommodating staff particularly the spa manager and the doorman valet great location and a really superb hotel throughout absolutely no complaints a fantastic weekend i would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody and will most certainly be returning access and proximity to the o2 arena is unrivalled great bathrooms and really big and comfortable beds the fillet steak in the restaurant was some of the best i ve eaten the pool and spa area are fantastic ,1
 very good hotel professional people s and very well organized unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure i will pay for this not more than 150 p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level,1
 bed lovely and comfy breakfast really good staff reception bar waiter all really great ,1
